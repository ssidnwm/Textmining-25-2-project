The VEGFA gene and anterior cruciate ligament rupture risk in the Caucasian population,2018-12-28,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Ewelina Lulińska-Kuklik, Katarzyna Leźnicka, Kinga Humińska-Lisowska, Waldemar Moska, Monika Michałowska-Sawczyn, Zbigniew Ossowski, Ewelina Maculewicz, Paweł Cięszczyk, Mariusz Kaczmarczyk, Wojciech Ratkowski, Krzysztof Ficek, Piotr Zmijewski, Agata Leońska-Duniec","The aim of the present study was to analyse VEGFA rs699947, rs1570360, and rs2010963 polymorphisms with susceptibility to anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR) in a Polish population. The study included 412 physically active Caucasian participants. The study group consisted of 222 individuals with surgically diagnosed primary ACLR qualified for ligament reconstruction (ACLR group). The control group consisted of 190 apparently healthy participants without any history of ACLR (CON group). Three polymorphisms within the VEGFA (rs699947, rs1570360, and rs2010963) gene were chosen for investigation due to their significance in the angiogenesis signalling pathway and previous associations with risk of ACLRs. Both single-locus and haplotype-based analyses were conducted. No significant differences in the allele and genotype frequency distributions were noted for the rs699947 and rs1570360 polymorphisms. In contrast, rs2010963 was associated with risk of ACLR in the codominant (p=0.047) and recessive model (p=0.017). In the latter, the CC genotype was overrepresented among individuals with ACL rupture (23.4% vs 14.2%, OR=1.85 [1.11-3.08]). Two VEGFA haplotypes were associated with ACLR under the additive (global score=11.39, p=0.022) and dominant model (global score=11.61, p=0.020). The [C;G;G] haplotype was underrepresented in the ACLR group (52.2% vs. 60.3%), whereas the [C;G;C] haplotype was overrepresented (2.9% vs 0.5%). The results obtained suggest a potential correlation between the VEGFA rs2010963 polymorphism and ACLR risk, suggesting that harbouring this specific C allele may be an unfavourable risk factor for a knee injury in Caucasian participants from Poland.","This paper investigates the association of specific VEGFA gene polymorphisms (rs699947, rs1570360, and rs2010963) with the risk of anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR) in a Caucasian Polish population, highlighting the findings from both single-locus and haplotype analyses. The study identifies that the rs2010963 polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of ACLR, suggesting that the C allele may be a genetic risk factor for knee injuries."
The relationship between ACTN3 R577X gene polymorphism and physical performance in amateur soccer players and sedentary individuals,2018-12-28,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Fatma E. Koku, Süleyman O. Karamızrak, Aynur S. Çiftçi, Hasan Taşlıdere, Burak Durmaz, Özgür Çoğulu","The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of ACTN3 R577X gene polymorphism in soccer players and sedentary individuals, and to investigate the relationship of this distribution with performance tests. A total of 100 soccer players and 101 sedentary individuals were enrolled in the study. Standing long jump and countermovement jump (with arm swing, without arm swing and repeated) scores were recorded, using a jump meter. Maximum VO2 levels were measured using a treadmill-connected cardiopulmonary exercise device, Masterscreen CPX. ACTN3 R577X polymorphism was evaluated by real-time PCR. ACTN3 R577X genotype distribution was found to be similar in soccer players and controls (p>0.05). The only statistically significant finding was a shorter countermovement jump with arm swing scores in the RR-genotyped soccer players, compared with their RX genotyped counterparts (p<0.05). In the soccer player group, RX-genotyped subjects were observed to have lower respiratory threshold values compared with RR-genotyped subjects (p<0.05). No significant correlation was detected between this distribution and performance test results. ACTN3 R577X genotype distribution was found to have no effect on sprint and endurance characteristics in amateur soccer players. The ACTN3 R577X polymorphism may not be a specific enough genetic marker to determine athletic performance in soccer.","The study investigates the distribution of the ACTN3 R577X gene polymorphism in amateur soccer players and sedentary individuals and its relationship with various performance tests. The findings indicate that while there was no significant effect of the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism on athletic performance, differences in jump scores and respiratory thresholds were noted among different genotypes within the soccer player group."
Reliability and validity of field‐based fitness tests in youth soccer players,2018-12-27,Wiley,European Journal of Sport Science,"James H. Dugdale, Calum A. Arthur, Dajo Sanders, Angus M. Hunter","ABSTRACT This study aimed to establish between‐day reliability and validity of commonly used field‐based fitness tests in youth soccer players of varied age and playing standards, and to discriminate between players without (“unidentified”) or with (“identified”) a direct route to professional football through their existing club pathway. Three‐hundred‐and‐seventy‐three Scottish youth soccer players (U11–U17) from three different playing standards (amateur, development, performance) completed a battery of commonly used generic field‐based fitness tests (grip dynamometry, standing broad jump, countermovement vertical jump, 505 (505COD) and T‐Drill (T‐Test) change of direction and 10/20 m sprint tests) on two separate occasions within 7–14 days. The majority of field‐based fitness tests selected within this study proved to be reliable measures of physical performance (ICC = 0.83–0.97; p &lt; .01). However, COD tests showed weaker reliability in younger participants (ICC = 0.57–0.79; p &lt; .01). The field‐based fitness testing battery significantly discriminated between the unidentified and identified players; χ 2 (7) = 101.646, p &lt; .001, with 70.2% of players being correctly classified. We have shown field‐based fitness tests to be reliable measures of physical performance in youth soccer players. However, results from the 505COD and T‐Test change of direction tests may be more variable in younger players, potentially due to complex demands of these tests and the limited training age established by these players. While the testing battery selected in this study was able to discriminate between unidentified and identified players, findings were inconsistent when attempting to differentiate between individual playing standards within the “identified” player group (development vs. performance).","This paper investigates the reliability and validity of common field-based fitness tests in youth soccer players, focusing on their effectiveness in distinguishing between players with direct pathways to professional football and those without. The study finds that while most tests demonstrate high reliability, change of direction tests show lower reliability in younger players, indicating variability in performance likely due to the complex nature of these assessments."
A mathematical model for decision-making in the classification of para-footballers with different severity of coordination impairments,2018-12-24,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Diego Pastor, María Campayo-Piernas, Jesús Tadeo Pastor, Raul Reina","Classification is a defining feature of Para-sport, and sports-specific classification systems determined through multidisciplinary scientific research are required, i.e., evidence-based and focused on the relationship between the impairment and the key performance determinants. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was applied as a classification tool using a directional distance function (DDF) model. The aim of the study was to test the DEA as a possible classification tool in cerebral palsy football. We analyse the performance of 56 international para-footballers with hypertonia, ataxia or athetosis, who completed a 20-test battery with DEA models. Five of the tests are included in the model (change of direction: Illinois agility test; jumping: standing broad jump, four bounds for distance, and triple hop with the non-dominant leg; 10-m sprint/acceleration; and ball dribbling, both in a straight line and following a trajectory), showing that players with less impairment exhibit the highest efficiency. This outcome suggests that DEA models might be feasible for detecting and discriminating the performance and magnitude of impairment in cerebral palsy football, with an objective ranking of the athletes in relation to different physical performance tests. This study also provides reference scores for decision-making during classification and guidance for further research in team Paralympic sports.","This paper explores the use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a classification tool for para-footballers with varying degrees of coordination impairments. It evaluates the performance of athletes with cerebral palsy across multiple physical tests, demonstrating the potential for DEA models to objectively rank players based on their physical performance and severity of impairment, thereby enhancing classification systems in Para-sport."
Postural Control Deficits After Repetitive Soccer Heading,2018-12-15,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Jaclyn B. Caccese, Thomas A. Buckley, Ryan T. Tierney, William C. Rose, Joseph J. Glutting, Thomas W. Kaminski","To determine the acute effects of repetitive soccer heading on postural control.Prospective study; participants were divided into 2 groups: a soccer heading group and a control group.Biomechanics laboratory.One hundred sixty participants, including youth (age = 13.0 ± 0.8 years), high school (age = 17.2 ± 1.0 years), and collegiate (age = 20.2 ± 1.3 years) male and female soccer players, participated in this study.Participants in the soccer heading group performed 12 soccer headers (initial velocity = 11.2 m/s). Postural control testing was performed both before (PRE) and immediately after (POST) the purposeful soccer headers. Control participants performed postural control testing PRE and POST a 15-minute wait period. During postural control testing, participants were asked to stand on the MobileMat (Tekscan Inc, Boston, Massachusetts) for two 2-minute intervals with their hands on their hips and their feet together with one eyes-open and one eyes-closed trial.Using the center-of-pressure data, 95% area, sway velocity, and ApEn were calculated. Multilevel linear models were used to analyze the effects of age, sex, group, condition, and concussion history simultaneously.Participants in the soccer heading group had significantly higher sway velocity POST than participants in the control group after controlling for age, sex, concussion history, condition, and PRE (t = -3.002; P = 0.003; 95% confidence interval, -0.482 to -0.100). There were no significant differences from PRE to POST for 95% area, M/L ApEn, and A/P ApEn.Repetitive soccer heading does not affect most postural control measures, even among youth athletes. However, sway velocity increased after heading relative to control participants independent of age, sex, and concussion history.","This paper investigates the acute effects of repetitive soccer heading on postural control among youth, high school, and collegiate soccer players. The findings reveal that while initial sway velocity significantly increased after heading, other postural control measures remained unchanged, suggesting that short-term heading may specifically affect balance dynamics regardless of demographic factors."
Comparative Analysis of Load Profile between Small-Sided Games and Official Matches in Youth Soccer Players,2018-12-12,MDPI AG,Sports,"Carlos Gómez-Carmona, José Gamonales, José Pino-Ortega, Sergio Ibáñez","The purposes of the present study are: (a) to characterize the external (eTL) and internal load (iTL) of official matches and small-sided games (SSGs) in relation to their objective, (b) to compare demands between SSG, and (c) to analyze the SSG requirements in relation to official matches during a one-month competition period. Twenty under-18 national-level soccer players were recorded using WIMUTM inertial devices (RealTrack Systems, Almeria, Spain) during four official matches and 12 training sessions where four SSGs with different objectives were performed: (SSG1) keeping the ball; (SSG2) keeping the ball and progressing; (SSG3) keeping the ball, progressing and ending in mini-goals; and (SSG4) keeping the ball, progressing and ending in an official goal with a goalkeeper. Statistical analysis included Kruskall-Wallis’ H and Mann-Whitney’s U with Cohen’s d effect size. The SSGs presented walking and jogging intensity movements (0.7–7 to 7–14 km/h), with a 5-to-8 %HIA (high intensity activity, &gt;16 km/h), where low intensity accelerations, decelerations and impacts were predominant (1–2.5 m/s2; 5–7 G), and %HRMAX (maximum heart rate percentage) was between 70–90%. Only SSG4 presented similar demands to competition, finding differences between SSGs (p &lt; 0.05; d = 1.40 − 0.36). In conclusion, the objective of the SSGs directly influenced the demands on the players in training sessions. For this reason, it is important to monitor demands for designing specific training sessions.","This study compares the external and internal load of official matches and small-sided games (SSGs) in youth soccer players to understand their demands and objectives. Results indicate that the intensity and nature of SSGs vary significantly, with SSG4 closely mirroring competition demands, highlighting the importance of tailoring training sessions to specific game objectives."
Comparison of Change of Direction Speed Performance and Asymmetries between Team-Sport Athletes: Application of Change of Direction Deficit,2018-12-12,MDPI AG,Sports,"Thomas Dos’Santos, Christopher Thomas, Paul Comfort, Paul A. Jones","The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine differences in change of direction (COD) performance and asymmetries between team-sports while considering the effects of sex and sport; (2) to evaluate the relationship between linear speed, COD completion time, and COD deficit. A total of 115 (56 males, 59 females) athletes active in cricket, soccer, netball, and basketball performed the 505 for both left and right limbs and a 10-m sprint test. All team-sports displayed directional dominance (i.e., faster turning performance/shorter COD deficits towards a direction) (p ≤ 0.001, g = -0.62 to -0.96, -11.0% to -28.4%) with, male cricketers tending to demonstrate the greatest COD deficit asymmetries between directions compared to other team-sports (28.4 ± 26.5%, g = 0.19⁻0.85), while female netballers displayed the lowest asymmetries (11.0 ± 10.1%, g = 0.14⁻0.86). Differences in sprint and COD performance were observed between sexes and sports, with males demonstrating faster 10-m sprint times, and 505 times compared to females of the same sport. Male soccer and male cricketers displayed shorter COD deficits compared to females of the same sport; however, female court athletes demonstrated shorter COD deficits compared to male court athletes. Large significant associations (ρ = 0.631⁻0.643, p < 0.001) between 505 time and COD deficit were revealed, while trivial, non-significant associations (ρ ≤ -0.094, p ≥ 0.320) between COD deficit and 10-m sprint times were observed. In conclusion, male and female team-sport athletes display significant asymmetries and directional dominance during a high approach velocity 180° turning task. Coaches and practitioners are advised to apply the COD deficit for a more isolated measure of COD ability (i.e., not biased towards athletes with superior acceleration and linear speed) and perform COD speed assessments from both directions to establish directional dominance and create a COD symmetry profile.","The paper investigates change of direction (COD) speed performance and asymmetries among team-sport athletes, examining the impact of sex and sport on these metrics. It highlights significant directional dominance in COD tasks, with notable differences observed between male and female athletes across various sports, suggesting a need for tailored COD speed assessments to account for these asymmetries."

Evolution of technology allows collection of in-creasingly larger and more specific data sets related to sport activities in cost-effective and accessible manner. All this information is minutely scrutinized by thousands of analysts around the globe in search of an-swers that can in the long term help increase the performance of indi-viduals or teams in their respective competitions. As the volume of data increases in size, so does the complexity of the problem and the need for suitable tools that leverage the cognitive load involved in the inves-tigation. It is proven that visualization and computer-vision techniques, correctly applied to the context of a problem, help data analysts focus on the relevant information at each stage of the process, and generally lead to a better understanding of the facts that lie behind the data. In the current study, we presented a software prototype capable of assisting researchers and performance analysts in their duty of studying group collective behavior in soccer games and trainings. We used geospatial data acquired from a professional match to demonstrate its capabilities in two different case studies. Furthermore, we successfully proved the efficiency of the different visualization techniques implemented in the prototype and demonstrated how visual analysis can effectively improve some of the basic tasks employed by sports experts on their daily work, complementing more traditional approaches.","This paper presents a software prototype designed to enhance the analysis of collective tactical behavior in soccer through data-driven visual performance analysis.

Football concussion case series using biomechanical and video analysis,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Mirellie Kelley, Jillian Urban, Derek Jones, Alexander Powers, Christopher T. Whitlow, Joseph Maldjian, Joel Stitzel","Approximately 1.1–1.9 million sport-related concussions among athletes ≤18 years of age occur annually in the United States, but there is limited understanding of the biomechanics and injury mechanisms associated with concussions among lower level football athletes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to combine biomechanical head impact data with video analysis to characterize youth and HS football concussion injury mechanisms. Head impact data were collected from athletes participating on 22 youth and 6 HS football teams between 2012 and 2017. Video was recorded, and head impact data were collected during all practices and games by instrumenting players with the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System. For each clinically diagnosed concussion, a video abstraction form was completed, which included questions concerning the context in which the injury occurred. Linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and impact location were used to characterize the concussive event and each injured athlete9s head impact exposure on the day of the concussion. A total of 9 (5 HS and 4 youth) concussions with biomechanics and video of the event were included in this study. The mean [range] linear and rotational acceleration of the concussive impacts were 62.9 [29.3–118.4] g and 3,056.7 [1,046.8–6,954.6] rad/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Concussive impacts were the highest magnitude impacts for 6 players and in the top quartile of impacts for 3 players on the day of injury. Concussions occurred in both practices (N = 4) and games (N = 5). The most common injury contact surface was helmet-to-helmet (N = 5), followed by helmet-to-ground (N = 3) and helmet-to-body (N = 1). All injuries occurred during player-to-player contact scenarios, including tackling (N = 4), blocking (N = 4), and collision with other players (N = 1). The biomechanics and injury mechanisms of concussions varied among athletes in our study; however, concussive impacts were among the highest severity for each player and all concussions occurred as a result of player-to-player contact.","This study analyzes the biomechanics of concussions in youth and high school football by combining head impact data and video analysis to identify injury mechanisms. It highlights the specific circumstances of concussions, revealing that high-magnitude impacts occurred primarily during player-to-player contact situations, with helmet-to-helmet collisions being the most common injury type."
Head impact burden and change in neurocognitive function over 2 seasons of youth football participation,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Sean C. Rose, Keith Yeates, Matthew T McCarthy, Darren R Fuerst, Patrick Ercole, Joseph Nguyen, Natalie Pizzimenti","<h3>Objective</h3> To determine the association of repetitive sub-concussive head impacts with neurocognitive outcomes in primary school and high school tackle football players. <h3>Methods</h3> We conducted a prospective cohort study of 35 primary school players age 9–12 and 20 high school players age 15–18 who each participated in 2 consecutive seasons of tackle football from 2016 to 2017. Helmet-based sensors were used to record head impacts during contact practices and games, which were summed as a cumulative impact for the 2 football seasons. Players were also divided into high intensity and low intensity groups based on whether they sustained high g-force impacts in both seasons. Players completed assessments on a variety of outcomes before the 2016 season and after the 2017 season: neuropsychological test performance, symptom ratings, vestibular-ocular function, balance, parent-completed ADHD symptoms, and self-reported behavioral adjustment. <h3>Results</h3> Average cumulative impact was 6,920 (SD 4,553) g-forces combined for the 2 seasons and did not differ between age groups (<i>p</i> = 0.66). Twenty-one players (38%) were classified as high intensity based on individual impacts. After correcting for multiple comparisons, neither cumulative impact nor impact intensity predicted change scores from pre-2016 season to post-2017 season on any outcome measures. Instead, younger age group and history of ADHD predicted worse change scores on several cognitive measures and ADHD symptom reporting. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Over 2 consecutive seasons of primary and high school tackle football participation, cumulative head impact burden and intensity of impacts were not found to be associated with changes in cognition, balance, vestibular-ocular function, or behavioral adjustment.","The paper investigates the relationship between repetitive sub-concussive head impacts and neurocognitive outcomes among youth football players across two seasons. Despite monitoring cumulative impacts through helmet sensors and assessing various cognitive and behavioral measures, the study found no significant association between head impact burden and changes in neurocognitive function, with younger age and ADHD history being more predictive of cognitive outcomes."
History of undiagnosed concussion is associated with concussion-like symptoms following subconcussive head impacts,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Jaclyn B. Caccese, Fernando Vanderlinde Santos, Mariana Gongora, Ian Sotnek, Elizabeth Kaye, Felipe Yamaguchi, John Jeka","Objective Immediate removal from activity after sport-related concussion is associated with less time missed from sport, a shorter symptomatic period, and better outcomes on acute clinical measures than delayed removal from activity. However, the effects of undiagnosed concussion on clinical outcomes have not been studied. In the case of an undiagnosed concussion, when the athlete is not removed from play, he/she may undergo subsequent repetitive head impacts. Subsequent head impacts may prevent complete recovery and make the athlete more sensitive to even mild mechanical head impact. The purpose of this study was to determine if soccer players with a history of undiagnosed concussion are more likely to report concussion-like symptoms following typical soccer heading than those without a history of undiagnosed concussion. Methods Thirty-one adult amateur soccer players (17 males and 14 females, 22.3 ± 4.5 years, 171.0 ± 9.2 cm, 71.9 ± 11.4 kg) completed a self-reported concussion/sport history questionnaire as part of a larger study aimed to identify behavioral and biomarkers of subconcussion. Participants were asked to report diagnosed and undiagnosed concussions. Undiagnosed concussions consisted of unreported and unrecognized concussions. Participants also indicated concussion-like symptoms typically experienced after soccer heading. A χ2 analysis was used to determine if a history of undiagnosed concussion was associated with prolonged concussion-like symptoms following subconcussive head impacts. Results Individuals with a history of undiagnosed concussion were more likely to report concussion-like symptoms following soccer heading (χ2 = 5.114, p = 0.024; Likelihood Ratio = 4.693, p = 0.030). Conclusions The results of this study suggest that individuals who experience unreported or unrecognized concussions may be more likely to experience concussion-like symptoms following repetitive subconcussive head impacts and highlight the importance for athletes in immediately reporting concussion signs and symptoms. We speculate that these individuals may not fully recover and may remain sensitive to mild mechanical head impact even years following their concussion.","This study investigates the relationship between a history of undiagnosed concussions and the likelihood of experiencing concussion-like symptoms after subconcussive head impacts in soccer players. The findings indicate that individuals with a history of unreported concussions are more prone to report such symptoms, emphasizing the critical need for athletes to promptly report concussion-related signs and symptoms."

A total of 116 varsity and club athletes from a Division-I university participated. Forty participants reported a HC (female/male: 31/9, age: 20.0 ± 1.4 years, height: 169.3 ± 13.1 cm, mass: 68.4 ± 14.0 kg) while 76 reported NHC (female/male: 60/16, age: 20.0 ± 1.7 years, height: 168.5 ± 12.9 cm, mass: 68.7 ± 14.6 kg). Individuals with a current concussion or lower extremity injury, or a history of lower extremity surgery were excluded. Participants completed the YBT anterior reach direction barefoot on both limbs. The YBT was completed by maximally reaching anteriorly, maintaining balance, and returning to the starting position without errors. Participants completed 4 practice trials and 3 test trials.

The effects of midsole bending stiffness on ball speed during maximum effort soccer kicks,2018-12-04,Informa UK Limited,Footwear Science,"Sasa Cigoja, Jordyn Vienneau, Sandro R. Nigg, Benno M. Nigg","The soccer kick is the most prominent movement in soccer. Kicking performance depends on two major factors: kicking accuracy and ball speed. During the soccer kick, momentum is transferred from the foot/cleat to the ball. This interplay between the foot/cleat and the ball can be modelled as a mixture of ‘impulse-like’ and ‘throwing-like’ components. While kicking the ball, the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and the cleat experience deformation. This deformation can be reduced by increasing the bending stiffness of the cleat’s midsole. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate experimentally the influence of midsole bending stiffness on ball speed during maximum effort soccer kicks. Twenty male subjects (mean ± SD; age: 29.5 ± 5.6 years, height: 175.5 ± 6.4 cm, mass: 74.3 ± 8.4 kg) performed six maximum effort soccer kicks in five stiffness conditions. Kinematic data were collected using an optical motion capture system consisting of eight high-speed cameras, and ball speed was recorded using a radar gun. There was no significant difference in the average ball speed between the five stiffness conditions when all subjects were pooled. Further, there was no significant difference in the change of the MTP joint angle from before ball contact to after ball contact between the stiffness configurations. Thirteen (of the 20) subjects showed the highest ball speed in the two stiffest cleats. The differences between the best and the worst performing stiffness configurations across all subjects ranged from 2.2 km/h to 9.2 km/h. The optimal stiffness condition that resulted in highest ball speed was subject specific, and therefore soccer cleats need to be tuned to individual players.","This paper investigates the impact of midsole bending stiffness of soccer cleats on ball speed during maximum effort kicks. It finds that while the average ball speed did not significantly differ across stiffness conditions, individual players exhibited optimal stiffness configurations that enhanced performance, indicating the need for tailored cleat designs."
Greater exposure to repetitive subconcussive head impacts is associated with vestibular dysfunction and balance impairments during walking,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Fernando Santos, Jaclyn B Caccese, Mariana Gongora, Ian Sotnek, Elizabeth Kaye, Felipe Yamaguchi, John Jeka","Exposure to repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RSHI), specifically soccer heading, is associated with white matter microstructural changes and cognitive performance impairments. However, the effect of soccer heading exposure on vestibular processing and balance control during walking has not been studied. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a tool that can be used to probe the vestibular system during standing and walking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of soccer heading with subclinical balance deficits during walking. Twenty adult amateur soccer players (10 males and 10 females, 22.3 ± 4.5 years, 170.5 ± 9.8 cm, 70.0 ± 10.5 kg) walked along a foam walkway with the eyes closed under 2 conditions: with GVS (∼40 trials) and without GVS (∼40 trials). Outcome measures included mediolateral center-of-mass (COM), center-of-pressure (COP) separation, foot placement, mediolateral ankle modulation, hip adduction, and ankle push off. For each balance mechanism, a GVS response was calculated (GVS, mean [without GVS]). In addition, participants completed a questionnaire, reporting soccer heading exposure over the past year. A linear regression model was used to determine if vestibular processing and balance during walking were related to RSHI exposure. Both foot placement (R2 = 0.324, p = 0.009) and hip adduction (R2 = 0.183, p = 0.50) were predicted by RSHI; whereby, greater exposure to RSHI was associated with greater foot placement and hip adduction responses. However, COM-COP separation (R2 &lt; 0.001, p = 0.927), ankle modulation (R2 = 0.037, p = 0.417), and push off (R2 &lt; 0.001, p = 0.968) were not related to RSHI exposure. Individuals who were exposed to greater RSHI were more perturbed by vestibular stimulation during walking, suggesting that there may be vestibular dysfunction and balance impairments with frequent heading; specifically, individuals with greater exposure to RSHI responded with larger foot placement and hip adduction responses to GVS.","The paper investigates the relationship between repetitive subconcussive head impacts from soccer heading and balance deficits during walking in amateur soccer players. Findings indicate that greater exposure to these impacts is linked to vestibular dysfunction, as reflected by changes in foot placement and hip adduction during vestibular stimulation trials, although other balance mechanisms showed no significant association."
Biomechanical comparison of concussions with and without a loss of consciousness in elite American football,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Janie Cournoyer, Thomas Blaine Hoshizaki","<h3>Introduction</h3> Loss of consciousness (LOC) occurs with approximately 8 percent of concussions in professional American football and has been associated with severity of injury (1, 2). However it is unknown how LOC relates to severity of head impact responses. The purpose of this study was to compare the head accelerations and brain tissue deformation between cases of concussions with and without LOC in elite American football to inform prevention strategies. <h3>Methods</h3> Concussive injuries with and without LOC from helmet-to-helmet and shoulder collisions as well as falls in elite American football were reconstructed in laboratory using hybrid III headform to obtain peak linear and rotational acceleration and maximum principal strain, cumulative strain damage at 10%, and strain rate metrics in 5 brain regions associated with loss of consciousness. <h3>Results</h3> Impact velocity, peak linear and rotational acceleration were greater in the LOC group than the no LOC group. The brain tissue deformation metrics were greater in the LOC group than the no LOC group. Linear acceleration was most predictive for cases of helmet-to-helmet collisions whereas shoulder collisions were best predicted by rotational acceleration. The best overall predictor was impact velocity. <h3>Discussion/conclusion</h3> The presence of a loss of consciousness in concussive impacts is a result of greater magnitude of brain tissue trauma. This was primarily caused by greater impact velocities in head impacts leading to LOC. Rules aiming at mitigating this aspect of the game would decrease the risk of a loss of consciousness in this sport. Each type of events resulted in different values of kinematic data and brain tissue deformation, which suggests that studies evaluating risk of concussions based 1 type of event cannot be generalized.","This study compares head accelerations and brain tissue deformation in concussions with and without loss of consciousness (LOC) in elite American football. It finds that concussions associated with LOC result in greater impact velocities and more severe brain trauma, suggesting the need for targeted rule changes to reduce the risk of LOC in the sport."
A single season of soccer results in no significant neurophysiological changes in adolescent female athletes,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Kaylin Ryan, Katherine Schiller, Roozbeh Rezaie, Brandon C. Baughman, Shalini Narayana","Introduction Sports related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a serious and increasing health incident in the United States, particularly in young children and adolescents, often affecting developing frontal and temporal lobes. Literature comparing various methods of cognitive assessment tools as well as the utility of various non-invasive brain imaging technologies in the diagnosis and follow up of mTBI lacks standardized methods and requires further investigation. We investigated the stability of intercortical and intracortical inhibition parameters and their relationship to white matter integrity, in athletes without mTBI. We hypothesized that a single season of soccer, without a concussion, would result in no significant neurophysiologic differences, in female adolescents. Methods Ten female soccer athletes, between the ages of 14–17 years were evaluated pre and post season using: neuropsychological testing, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), anatomical MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). One athlete sustained a concussion and was subsequently removed from analysis. Results There was no significant difference when comparing pre- and post-season measures for: neuropsychological testing; intercortical ( p = 0.812) or intracortical ( p = 0.888) inhibition, measured by duration of silent periods during TMS; motor evoked potential onset ( p = 0.227) or duration ( p = 0.977); and interhemispheric conduction times ( p = 0.092). In addition, no significant difference was found between pre and post assessments of fractional anisotropy, for white matter tracts of interest: posterior limb of internal capsule; cortical spinal tracts; and genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum. Conclusion Following a season of soccer, there was no difference in any neurologic parameters that would elicit concern for the continuation of the sport at this level. We demonstrate that the inter- and intra-cortical inhibitory parameters derived from TMS are stable; therefore, TMS and DTI can be used as reliable measures for further investigation of patients sustaining mTBI.","The paper investigates the neurophysiological impact of a single soccer season on adolescent female athletes, hypothesizing no significant changes in brain function without a concussion. Results show no significant differences in neuropsychological assessments or white matter integrity parameters pre- and post-season, indicating that playing soccer at this level does not adversely affect neurological health in the absence of mTBI."
Changes in functional connectivity are associated with one season of head-to-ball impact exposure in male collegiate soccer athletes,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Derek C. Monroe, David Keator, Robert Blumenfeld, James Hicks, Steven L. Small","<h3>Objectives</h3> Return-to-play protocols could be improved by a better understanding of the physiologic effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Autonomic dysregulation is thought to underlie many of the multi-dimensional symptoms following mTBI and may derive from altered connectivity in the brain central autonomic network (CAN). Understanding the relationship between injury and CAN connectivity could lead to a useful biomarker for mTBI. Toward this end, the present study aimed to establish a formal relationship between non-symptomatic head-to-ball impacts (""headers"") and CAN connectivity in collegiate soccer athletes. <h3>Methods</h3> Eleven male NCAA Division I soccer players were monitored by athletic training staff throughout 1 season for the number of headers. Ten male NCAA Division I athletes (3 cross-country and 7 golfers) served as controls. All participants underwent resting-state fMRI pre- and post-season. Twenty ROIs were selected based on regions previously implicated in control and modulation of autonomic function. Graph theoretical analyses were used to probe changes in network architecture and connectivity. Specific contrasts focused on pre- and post-season changes that were explained by individual differences in exposure to headers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 uncorrected). <h3>Results</h3> Within the 20 node network, increases in headers were associated with reduced degree centrality of the left and right insular cortex and right putamen (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.02), increased degree and betweenness centrality in the left anterior and right posterior Para hippocampal gyri (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.03), and increased betweenness centrality in the anterior cingulate cortex (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Headers were also associated with reduced functional connectivity within the subnetwork including the anterior cingulate cortex (<i>p</i> = 0.0073), right hippocampus, left putamen, and left insular cortex (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.04). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Highly skilled soccer players who sustained the greatest number of head impacts also experienced the greatest altered connectivity among regions associated with autonomic function. Future work to establish autonomic function as an injury biomarker should consider the importance of cumulative impact magnitudes.","This paper investigates the relationship between head-to-ball impacts and changes in functional connectivity within the central autonomic network (CAN) in male collegiate soccer players. The findings indicate that increased exposure to headers is linked to altered connectivity in regions associated with autonomic function, suggesting potential pathways for developing biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)."
In-season variations in head impact exposure among youth football players,2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Jillian Urban, Mirellie Kelley, Mark Espeland, Elizabeth Davenport, Christopher T. Whitlow, Alexander Powers, Joseph Maldjian, Joel Stitzel","Sport-related head impacts are of increasing concern as early evidence has demonstrated a relationship between subconcussive head impact exposure (HIE) experienced in contact sports, such as football, and changes in pre-to post-season imaging and cognitive measures. Cumulative HIE is often measured with a single number that amounts to the total exposure measured over the season and does not give any indication as to how the exposure was accumulated, nor how it varies during the season. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare HIE during preseason, the first and second halves of the regular season, and playoffs in a sample of youth football players (n = 119, ages 9–13). Athletes were divided into 1 of 4 exposure groups based on quartiles computed from the distribution of risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWECP). The mean 95th percentile linear and rotational accelerations and impacts per session in practices and games were compared across 4 exposure groups and time frames using mixed effects models. Within games, the sample mean 95th percentile linear and rotational accelerations ranged from 47.2 g and 2,331.3 rad/s<sup>2</sup> during preseason to 52.1 g and 2,533.4 rad/s<sup>2</sup> during the second half of regular season. Mean impacts per practice increased from preseason to the second half of regular season and declined into playoffs among all exposure groups; however, the variation between time frames was not greater than 2 impacts per practice. Time of season had a significant effect on mean 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration in games (both <i>p</i> = 0.01) but not on practice accelerations or impacts/session. Mean 95th percentile accelerations for games showed significant interaction effects between exposure group and season segment (linear <i>p</i> = 0.05 and rotational <i>p</i> = 0.04). The results of this study improve our understanding of in-season variations in youth football HIE and may inform important opportunities for future interventions.","This study investigates the variations in head impact exposure (HIE) among youth football players throughout different segments of the season, including preseason, regular season, and playoffs. The findings highlight significant fluctuations in the mean 95th percentile linear and rotational accelerations during games, revealing that season timing influences head impact exposure, potentially guiding future interventions for player safety."
Head impact analysis in elite football (soccer),2018-12-04,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Bianca Brigitte Rock, Thomas Blaine Hoshizaki","<h3>Introduction</h3> Trauma related neuropathologies including recent reports involving chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in 8 soccer players have been concerning. Purposeful sub-concussive head impacts, known as headers, are an integral part of the game. The purpose of this study was to describe dynamic head response and brain tissue strains for front ball-to-head impacts in elite soccer. <h3>Methods</h3> Video analysis thirteen (13) Champion9s League soccer footage was completed to establish reconstruction parameters of head impact events. Analysis of 5 (5) front ball-to-head events were reconstructed using a Hybrid III 50th percentile headform and a pneumatic linear impactor. The University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model was used to calculate maximum principal strain (MPS). <h3>Results and discussion</h3> Recorded head impact velocities during elite soccer game play were 3.5–23.0 m/s. Most purposeful head-to-ball impacts occurred on the front-temporal region of the head (66.4%) at 0–15 degrees of cervical flexion. There was an average of 1.5 unintentional head impacts and 62.2 headers per game; 49.6% of headers occurred at an inbound velocity below 10 m/s. The lowest velocity reconstructed was 4.7 m/s, yielding 12.8 g and 604 rad/s<sup>2</sup> for peak resultant linear and rotational accelerations, respectively; the MPS for this impact was 0.09. Neurophysiologic changes and functional impairment have been reported in past research on sub-concussive impacts with 5%–15% strain. The mean 0.11 MPS yielded in this study reflects a potential for these changes in elite soccer athletes. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The main objective of this analysis was to identify impact characteristics and quantify dynamic cerebral response and brain tissue deformation in elite soccer game play. Further research must include cervical muscle activation, the level of play and player position, inbound ball-to-head velocities during different game play events and appropriate impact characteristics to appropriately characterize risk of injury in the attempts of mitigating risk of head injury during soccer game play.","This paper investigates head impact dynamics and brain tissue strains resulting from headers in elite soccer, highlighting concerns about trauma-related neuropathologies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Evaluation of Brain Response during Head Impact in Youth Athletes Using an Anatomically Accurate Finite Element Model,2018-11-29,Mary Ann Liebert Inc,Journal of Neurotrauma,"Logan E. Miller, Jillian E. Urban, Mireille E. Kelley, Alexander K. Powers, Christopher T. Whitlow, Joseph A. Maldjian, Steven Rowson, Joel D. Stitzel","During normal participation in football, players are exposed to repetitive subconcussive head impacts, or impacts that do not result in signs and symptoms of concussion. To better understand the effects of repetitive subconcussive impacts, the biomechanics of on-field head impacts and resulting brain deformation need to be well characterized. The current study evaluates local brain response to typical youth football head impacts using the atlas-based brain model (ABM), an anatomically accurate brain finite element (FE) model. Head impact kinematic data were collected from three local youth football teams using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System. The azimuth and elevation angles were used to identify impacts near six locations of interest, and low, moderate, and high acceleration magnitudes (5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles, respectively) were calculated from the grouped impacts for FE simulation. Strain response in the brain was evaluated by examining the range and peak maximum principal strain (MPS) values in each element. A total of 40,538 impacts from 119 individual athletes were analyzed. Impacts to the facemask resulted in 0.18 MPS for the high magnitude impact category. This was 1.5 times greater than the oblique impact location, which resulted in the lowest strain value of 0.12 for high magnitude impacts. Overall, higher strains resulted from a 95th percentile lateral impact (41.0g, 2556 rad/sec2) with two predominant axes of rotation than from a 95th percentile frontal impact (67.6g, 2641 rad/sec2) with a single predominant axis of rotation. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for directional dependence and relative contribution of axes of rotation when evaluating head impact response.","This paper evaluates the brain's response to head impacts in youth football using an anatomically accurate finite element model.

Interlimb Asymmetries Identified Using the Rate of Torque Development in Ballistic Contraction Targeting Submaximal Torques,2018-11-28,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Gennaro Boccia, Paolo Riccardo Brustio, Giampiero Buttacchio, Marzia Calabrese, Marco Bruzzone, Roberto Casale, Alberto Rainoldi","Evaluating the rate of torque development (RTD) in isometric ballistic contraction targeting submaximal torques is usually overlooked in the literature. In a series of isometric ballistic contractions targeting a range of submaximal torque values, there is a linear relationship between the peak torque and the peak RTD obtained in each contraction. RTD scaling factor (RTD-SF) represents the slope of this relationship. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of interlimb asymmetry in the RTD-SF and in the RTD calculated across submaximal torques. Furthermore, we compared these asymmetry indices with those calculated adopting more classical approaches, such as ballistic contraction targeting maximal torque and isokinetic concentric conditions. Quadriceps and hamstrings strength was evaluated in both limbs of elite under 17 and under 19 soccer players (20 males, 17 ± 1 years). Participants performed three concentric isokinetic contractions at 240°/s and a series of isometric ballistic contractions targeting from 20 to 100% of maximal isometric torque. The interlimb difference was calculated for each parameter and players presenting an interlimb difference >15% were identified. A total of 40% (for quadriceps) and 60% (for hamstring) of players showed an interlimb asymmetry in isometric RTD for at least 50% of submaximal torque range. The RTD-SF was able to identify more players with asymmetry than the classical isokinetic tests. However, isokinetic and isometric indices of asymmetry were in general poorly or not correlated with each other. Most players presented an interlimb asymmetry in RTD for a wide part of the torque range and the adopted protocol was able to highlight important interindividual differences. Furthermore, players showed a large prevalence of RTD-SF asymmetry in both quadriceps and hamstrings. It is still to be determined if these asymmetries are functionally relevant. Nevertheless, the adopted protocol provided meaningful information for identifying interlimb asymmetries that could not be gathered when adopting the classical method of ballistic contractions targeting only maximal torques.","This paper investigates the prevalence of interlimb asymmetries in the rate of torque development (RTD) during isometric ballistic contractions targeting submaximal torques among elite under 17 and under 19 soccer players. The findings reveal that a significant proportion of players exhibited asymmetries in RTD, particularly in the quadriceps and hamstrings, highlighting the effectiveness of the RTD scaling factor (RTD-SF) over traditional isokinetic tests in identifying these differences."

Higher Rates of Lower Extremity Injury on Synthetic Turf Compared With Natural Turf Among National Football League Athletes: Epidemiologic Confirmation of a Biomechanical Hypothesis,2018-11-19,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Christina D. Mack, Elliott B. Hershman, Robert B. Anderson, Michael J. Coughlin, Andrew S. McNitt, Rachel R. Sendor, Richard W. Kent","Biomechanical studies have shown that synthetic turf surfaces do not release cleats as readily as natural turf, and it has been hypothesized that concomitant increased loading on the foot contributes to the incidence of lower body injuries. This study evaluates this hypothesis from an epidemiologic perspective, examining whether the lower extremity injury rate in National Football League (NFL) games is greater on contemporary synthetic turfs as compared with natural surfaces.Incidence of lower body injury is higher on synthetic turf than on natural turf among elite NFL athletes playing on modern-generation surfaces.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Lower extremity injuries reported during 2012-2016 regular season games were included, with all 32 NFL teams reporting injuries under mandated, consistent data collection guidelines. Poisson models were used to construct crude and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to estimate the influence of surface type on lower body injury groupings (all lower extremity, knee, ankle/foot) for any injury reported as causing a player to miss football participation as well as injuries resulting in ≥8 days missed. A secondary analysis was performed on noncontact/surface contact injuries.Play on synthetic turf resulted in a 16% increase in lower extremity injuries per play than that on natural turf (IRR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.23). This association between synthetic turf and injury remained when injuries were restricted to those that resulted in ≥8 days missed, as well as when categorizations were narrowed to focus on distal injuries anatomically closer to the playing surface (knee, ankle/foot). The higher rate of injury on synthetic turf was notably stronger when injuries were restricted to noncontact/surface contact injuries (IRRs, 1.20-2.03; all statistically significant).These results support the biomechanical mechanism hypothesized and add confidence to the conclusion that synthetic turf surfaces have a causal impact on lower extremity injury.","This study investigates the incidence of lower extremity injuries among NFL athletes, comparing synthetic turf to natural turf surfaces. The findings indicate that injuries are 16% more likely to occur on synthetic turf, particularly in noncontact and surface contact scenarios, supporting a biomechanical hypothesis regarding the increased loading on the foot due to differing turf types."
Slow velocity of the center of pressure and high heel pressures may increase the risk of Sever’s disease: a case-control study,2018-11-19,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Pediatrics,"David Rodríguez-Sanz, Ricardo Becerro-de-Bengoa-Vallejo, Daniel López-López, Cesar Calvo-Lobo, Eva María Martínez-Jiménez, Eduardo Perez-Boal, Marta Elena Losa-Iglesias, Patricia Palomo-López","This study determined if the body mass index, dynamic plantar-pressures, plantar surface contact-area, velocity of the centre of pressure (COP), gastrocnemius equinus, and gastrocnemius soleus equines are related to calcaneal apophysitis (Sever's disease) in athletic children. This case-control study examined 106 boys enrolled in a soccer academy, including 53 with Sever's disease and 53 age-matched healthy controls. The dynamic average and maximum peak plantar-pressures, plantar surface contact-area, and velocity of the COP were evaluated with a digital pressure sensor platform. Goniometry was used to measure the ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and thereby identify gastrocnemius equinus and gastrocnemius soleus equinus. Participants with Sever's condition had significantly higher BMI and peak plantar-pressures (maximum and average) at the heel (Cohen's d > 3 for pressures) than the controls. Those with Sever's disease also had significantly slower velocity of the COP (Cohen's d > 3). Boys with Sever's disease were also 8 times more likely to have bilateral gastrocnemius equinus than disease controls. High heel plantar pressure and low velocity of COP are related to Sever's condition in boys, although it is not clear whether these factors predispose individuals to the disease or are consequences of the disease. Gastrocnemius ankle equinus could be a predisposing factor for Sever's condition.","This paper investigates the relationship between various biomechanical factors and Sever's disease in athletic children, specifically focusing on boys in a soccer academy. Key findings indicate that boys with Sever's disease exhibited higher body mass index and peak plantar pressures at the heel, along with a slower velocity of the center of pressure, suggesting a potential link between these factors and the risk of developing this condition."
Different visual stimuli affect muscle activation at the knee during sidestepping,2018-11-19,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Marcus J.C. Lee, David G. Lloyd, Brendan S. Lay, Paul D. Bourke, Jacqueline A. Alderson","Increasing knee stability via appropriate muscle activation could reduce anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk during unplanned sidestepping. High-level athletes may activate their knee muscles differently from low-level athletes when responding to quasi-game realistic versus non game-realistic stimuli. Eleven high-level and 10 low-level soccer players responded to a non game-realistic arrow-planned condition (AP), a quasi game-realistic one-defender scenario (1DS) and two-defender scenario (2DS), and an arrow-unplanned condition (AUNP), that imposed increasing time constraints to sidestep. Activation from eight knee muscles during sidestepping was measured during pre-contact and weight-acceptance. Knee flexor-extensor co-activation ratios were established. Muscle activation levels increased by approximately 27% solely in the 1DS in both sidestepping phases. In the 2DS, the shift from a flexor dominant co-activation strategy in pre-contact toward extensor dominance in weight-acceptance commenced earlier for the high-level players. Quasi game-realistic information allowed for anticipatory increases in knee muscle activation regardless of expertise levels but only when the time demands to respond were low (1DS). High-level players were better at interpreting complex game-realistic information (2DS) to activate their knee extensors earlier in preparation for single-leg landing during weight-acceptance.","The paper investigates how different visual stimuli influence muscle activation at the knee during sidestepping, with a focus on the differences between high-level and low-level soccer players. Findings indicate that high-level athletes demonstrate superior activation of knee muscles under quasi-game-realistic conditions, particularly in more complex scenarios, which may enhance knee stability and potentially reduce ACL injury risk."

Validity of an On-Field Readaptation Program Following a Hamstring Injury in Professional Soccer,2018-11-14,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Sergio Jiménez-Rubio, Archit Navandar, Jesús Rivilla-García, Victor Paredes-Hernández","Context : Despite the presence of various injury prevention programs, the rate of hamstring injuries and reinjuries is increasing in soccer, warranting the need for a soccer-specific rehabilitation program. Objective : To develop and validate a new, functional on-field program for the rehabilitation and readaptation of soccer players after a hamstring strain injury through a panel of experts; and determine the usefulness of the program through its application in professional soccer players. Design : A 13-item program was developed, which was validated by a panel of experts and later applied to professional soccer players. Setting : Soccer training ground. Participants : Fifteen strength and conditioning and rehabilitation fitness coaches with a professional experience of 15.40 (1.57) years in elite clubs and national teams in Europe validated the program. The program was later applied to 19 professional soccer players of the Spanish First Division (La Liga). Interventions : Once a player sustained a clinically diagnosed injury, the player would first be subject to mobilization and strengthening exercises in the gym after undergoing treatment by percutaneous needle electrolysis. The player would then complete an on-field readaptation program consisting of 13 drills arranged in a progressive manner in terms of complexity. The drills integrated various aspects of repeated sprint abilities, retraining and reeducation of biomechanical patterns, and neuromuscular control of the core and lower limbs. Main Outcome Measures : Aiken’s V for each item of the program and number of days taken by the players to return to play. Results : The experts evaluated all items of the program very highly, as seen from Aiken’s V values between 0.78 and 0.98 (0.63–0.99) for all drills, while the return to play was in 22.42 (2.32) days. Conclusion : This program has the potential to help a player suffering from a hamstring strain injury to adapt to real-match conditions in the readaptation phase through the application of sports-specific drills that were very similar to the different injury mechanisms.","This paper focuses on the development and validation of a functional on-field rehabilitation program tailored for soccer players recovering from hamstring strains. The program, validated by expert coaches, includes 13 progressive drills aimed at enhancing sprint abilities and retraining biomechanical patterns, demonstrating a promising average return-to-play time of approximately 22 days."
Effect of extrinsic factors and structural components on sport functionality of artificial turf surfaces,2018-11-14,SAGE Publications,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology","Leonor Gallardo, Jorge García-Unanue, Pascal Haxaire, Víctor Villacañas, Enrique Colino, Javier Sánchez-Sánchez","The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of environmental factors on the mechanical behaviour of artificial turf football pitches and evaluate the effect of induced wear on the mechanical properties of the surface. A series of laboratory tests were conducted on 31 samples of artificial turf. The tests were done by a Fédération Internationale de Football Association–accredited test institute. In wet conditions, the shock absorption and linear friction slide were significantly higher than in dry conditions, whereas the angle ball rebound was significantly lower. Regarding the wear effect, a significant increment of the vertical rebound and rotational resistance was produced. The shock absorption and vertical deformation significantly decreased. The mechanical properties deteriorated 5.90% less in the samples that had installed an elastic layer compared to those that did not. The shock absorption was significantly lower at 40°C compared to the shock absorption at −5°C and 23°C. These findings highlight the importance of installing an elastic layer in artificial turf football pitches, to increase their useful life and, therefore, to assure the security of the users for a longer time.","This study investigates the impact of environmental factors and wear on the mechanical properties of artificial turf surfaces used in football. Key findings indicate that conditions such as moisture significantly affect shock absorption and ball rebound, and that the inclusion of an elastic layer can enhance durability and safety of the turf."
3 Influence of input data errors on the inverse dynamics analysis of human locomotion: time-series changes in lower extremity joint moment and power during running,2018-11-14,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine,Abstracts,Heung-Youl Kim,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of inaccuracies between the center of pressure (CoP) recorded from a force platform and the body segment parameters (BSP) calculated from the different anthropometric models on resultant joint moment and power. Biomechanical data while running were obtained for one healthy male subject. Using inverse dynamics procedures, the lower extremity joint moment and power were computed for five successful trials. Thereafter, recalculations of the joint kinetic values were carried out under the following conditions: (1) five different BSP models (i.e., Ae (Japanese model), Vaughan, Chandler, Zatsiorsky, and De Leva), and (2) The CoP shifted in the anterior-posterior direction by ±5% and±10% from the actual location. Changes of the joint kinetics resulting from difference in BSP models showed similar changes in all joints. There was similar changes between the curves, and statistically significant difference in the results was not observed. On the other hand, the anterior shifts in the CoP caused an elevation in the ankle plantal flextion and hip extension moment curves and a decrease in the knee extension moment curves. The posterior shifts in the CoP had the opposite effects. But the times of occurrence of the peak values were not affected. When CoP was shifted in the anterior direction, the ankle and hip joint power generations were increased, and decreased in the posterior direction. In the knee joint power generation had the opposite results. The adjustments in the CoP produced changes in the observed joint moment variables of 14% and 34%, on average for the ±5% and±10% shifts, respectively. On the other hand, in the joint powers, greater power generation was observed with hip joint than other joint powers. Using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, when CoP location was shifted in the anterior-posterior direction (±5% and±10%) were significantly associated with joint moment and power values (p&lt;0.01). The joint moment and power are more sensitive to errors in the CoP calculated from a force plate measurements than in BSP parameters. Consequently, those results suggest that it is necessary to pay close attention to the level of experimental errors to ensure meaningful results when using inverse dynamics procedures in various fields.","This study examines how inaccuracies in the center of pressure (CoP) measurements from force platforms affect joint moments and power during running, using different body segment parameter models. The findings indicate that shifts in CoP significantly influence the kinetic values of lower extremity joints, emphasizing the importance of minimizing experimental errors in inverse dynamics analyses."
2 Mental wellbeing in elite male under 23 soccer players: a team case study,2018-11-14,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine,Abstracts,"Andy Richardson, Tom Clifford, Will Abbott, Thomas E Brownlee, Liam D Harper, Robert J Naughton","Recent research suggests a high prevalence of mental health disorders in professional soccer players, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, distress and adverse eating behaviours. Whilst a limited number of studies address this issue, the existing evidence is alarming and highlights a need for further investigations to develop a better understanding of the causes and consequences of mental health problems in professional soccer players. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of physical and emotional stressors on mental wellbeing (MW) in professional male soccer players. Using a longitudinal design, twenty-five male soccer players from the under 23 squad playing in the Premier League 2 division in the UK completed the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) each week of the 2017/2018 season (37 weeks in total). Independent predictor variables of MW were injury, match selection (in the match squad), weekly training load (sum of total duration, total distance and total sprint distance) and win rate. Mean MW scores were calculated across the season for each player with a squad mean of 48±3.94, which is below the England population norm of 51.6. Mean MW was significantly lower when injured vs. not-injured (43.6±5.0 vs 49.9±3.5; p=0.01), but was not affected by selection, training load or match result. Multivariate regression models showed time out with injury to have the strongest influence on MW (r<sup>2</sup>=0.40, p&lt;0.01), with longer periods of injury linked to lower MW scores. Matchday selection was the only other statistically significant variable, with a positive correlation between MW and selection (r<sup>2</sup>=0.23, p=0.02). Whilst elucidating the mechanisms by which time out with injury may affect MW was beyond the scope of this study, the association between injury and reduced MW highlights a need for mental health and wellbeing monitoring in injured soccer players. This could facilitate interventions and support to ensure health and performance are not negatively affected.","This paper investigates the impact of physical and emotional stressors on the mental wellbeing (MW) of elite male under 23 soccer players, highlighting a concerning prevalence of mental health disorders in this population. Findings reveal that injury significantly lowers MW scores, suggesting the necessity for mental health monitoring and interventions to support affected players."
"Trunk peak torque, muscle activation pattern and sudden loading compensation in adolescent athletes with back pain",2018-11-13,SAGE Publications,Journal of Back and Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation,"Steffen Mueller, Josefine Stoll, Michael Cassel, Tilman Engel, Juliane Mueller, Frank Mayer","To evaluate trunk peak torque and muscle activation pattern during isokinetic and sudden trunk loading (STL) between adolescent athletes with/without back pain.Nine adolescent athletes with back pain (BP) (m/f 2/7; 15.6 ± 1.2 y; 177 ± 9 cm; 67 ± 13 kg; 22.5 ± 9.8 h/week) and nine matched controls (m/f 2/7; 15.7 ± 1.4 y; 177 ± 12 cm; 65 ± 9 kg; 16.5 ± 8.0 h/week training) were included. Trunk strength in rotation and flexion/extension was assessed. Sudden trunk loading was measured during eccentric extension and rotation (30∘/s) with additional perturbation. Trunk muscle activity was measured using a 12 lead-EMG (electromyography). Main outcome measures were peak torque [Nm] and MVC normalized EMG-amplitudes (RMS [%]) for each muscle. Additionally, the mean EMG-RMS for four areas of the trunk was calculated (right/left ventral, right/left dorsal).Back pain showed lower trunk peak torque for all conditions in extension/flexion, but not for rotation. EMG amplitudes were increased for BP athletes with statistical significant differences for dorsal muscles in rotation and extension (p< 0.0042), not for ventral muscles in flexion.The evaluation of strength and muscle activity in isokinetic and sudden trunk loading presents altered trunk function in adolescent back pain athletes. Training interventions focusing on trunk strength and muscular activation pattern appears reasonable.","This paper evaluates trunk peak torque and muscle activation patterns in adolescent athletes with and without back pain during isokinetic and sudden trunk loading scenarios. Findings reveal that athletes with back pain exhibit lower trunk peak torque, particularly in extension and flexion, along with altered muscle activation patterns, underscoring the need for targeted training interventions to enhance trunk strength and function."

Recommendations for hamstring injury prevention in elite football: translating research into practice,2018-11-09,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Matthew Buckthorpe, Steve Wright, Stewart Bruce-Low, Gianni Nanni, Thomas Sturdy, Aleksander Stephan Gross, Laura Bowen, Bill Styles, Stefano Della Villa, Michael Davison, Mo Gimpel","Injuries in football exert negative impacts on team performance1 and club finance.2 Hamstring strain injuries (HSI) are consistently the most prevalent time loss injury in football3 and as such are an important issue in football medicine. Despite an ever-increasing wealth of information emerging on the aetiology of HSIs, their incidence in football is increasing.3 This could be explained by the increased intensity and physical demands of football match play over the last decade4; but practitioners should also question their approach to injury prevention and physical preparation of players, an area where research is lacking.5–8 

There is an evidence-based strategy to prevent HSIs, however, there appears to be a large disconnect between this available evidence and its adoption in elite football.5 6 For example, the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) programme has been shown to effectively reduce HSIs by 65%–70%.9 10 But recent surveys of elite European Champions League (n=32) and Norwegian Premier League (n=18) teams showed that only 11% of these teams fully adopt the programme.11 

Within elite football, there is a large disconnect between evidence-based practice and the actual interventions used by science and medical teams to prevent injuries.12 In line with an emerging body of evidence-based research, we believe that preventing HSIs in elite football requires a holistic approach, which considers multiple risk factors and their inter-relations, implemented effectively.6–8 13 In designing our injury prevention programme, we combine both the theory and the available evidence on HSI risk factors and intervention studies, as well as considering the context surrounding the player when designing our overall injury prevention approach.

Radiographic Analysis of National Football League Players’ Fifth Metatarsal Morphology Relationship to Proximal Fifth Metatarsal Fracture Risk,2018-11-07,SAGE Publications,Foot &amp; Ankle International,"Sydney C. Karnovsky, Andrew J. Rosenbaum, Bridget DeSandis, Christopher Johnson, Conor I. Murphy, Russell F. Warren, Samuel A. Taylor, Mark C. Drakos","Fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal are one of the most common foot injuries in athletes. Repetitive stresses endured by the fifth metatarsal can lead to stress fracture, delayed union, and refracture, making optimal treatment challenging. A radiographic analysis of fifth metatarsal morphology and foot type in National Football League (NFL) players was performed to investigate morphologic risk factors for these injuries.This was a case-control study that looked at NFL players treated between 1992 and 2012, as well as participants at the NFL Combine. Ninety-six feet (51 athletes) were included. Fractures were present in 15 feet. Two reviewers assessed fifth metatarsal morphology and foot type on anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiographs. Differences in foot type and metatarsal morphology between athletes with and without fractures were determined.On anteroposterior radiographs, significant differences in apex medullary canal width, 4-5 intermetatarsal angle, fifth metatarsal angle, and talar head uncovering were observed between fractured and non-fractured feet ( P = .001, .003, .004, .008, respectively). On lateral radiographs, significant differences in the fifth metatarsal length, distance to apex, apex height, fifth metatarsal angle, and talocalcaneal angle were observed between fractured and nonfractured feet ( P = .04, .01, .02, .01, .01, respectively). On oblique radiographs, a significant difference was observed in apex height between fractured and nonfractured feet ( P = .002).Individuals with long, narrow, and straight fifth metatarsals with an adducted forefoot were most at risk for fifth metatarsal fractures. With this insight, attempts at fracture prevention can be implemented via footwear modifications, orthoses, and off-loading braces that account for those aforementioned morphologic attributes that place athletes at risk.Level III, retrospective comparative study.","This paper investigates the relationship between the morphology of the fifth metatarsal and the risk of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures in NFL players.

Video Analysis of Reported Concussion Events in the National Football League During the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 Seasons,2018-11-06,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"David J. Lessley, Richard W. Kent, James R. Funk, Christopher P. Sherwood, Joseph M. Cormier, Jeff R. Crandall, Kristy B. Arbogast, Barry S. Myers","Background: Concussions in American football remain a high priority of sports injury prevention programs. Detailed video review provides important information on causation, the outcomes of rule changes, and guidance on future injury prevention strategies. Purpose: Documentation of concussions sustained in National Football League games played during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons, including consideration of video views unavailable to the public. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: All reported concussions were reviewed with all available video footage. Standardized terminology and associated definitions were developed to describe and categorize the details of each concussion. Results: Cornerbacks sustained the most concussions, followed by wide receivers, then linebackers and offensive linemen. Half (50%) of concussions occurred during a passing play, 28% during a rushing play, and 21% on a punt or kickoff. Tackling was found to be the most common activity of concussed players, with the side of the helmet the most common helmet impact location. The distribution of helmet impact source—the object that contacted the concussed player’s helmet—differed from studies of earlier seasons, with a higher proportion of helmet-to-body impacts (particularly shoulder) and helmet-to-ground impacts and with a lower proportion of helmet-to-helmet impacts. Helmet-to-ground concussive impacts were notable for the high prevalence of impacts to the back of the helmet and their frequency during passing plays. Conclusion: Concussion causation scenarios in the National Football League have changed over time. Clinical Relevance: The results of this study suggest the need for expanded evaluation of concussion countermeasures beyond solely helmet-to-helmet test systems, including consideration of impacts with the ground and with the body of the opposing player. It also suggests the possibility of position-specific countermeasures as part of an ongoing effort to improve safety.","The paper analyzes concussion events in the National Football League during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons through detailed video reviews. Key findings indicate that cornerbacks are the most frequently concussed players, highlighting a shift towards increased helmet-to-body and helmet-to-ground impacts, which suggests the need for revised concussion prevention strategies beyond traditional helmet testing."
A previous hamstring injury affects kicking mechanics in soccer players,2018-11-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Archit Navandar, Santiago Veiga, Gonzalo Torres, David Chorro, Enrique Navarro","BACKGROUND: Although the kicking skill is influenced by limb dominance and sex, how a previous hamstring injury affects kicking has not been studied in detail.Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex and limb dominance on kicking in limbs with and without a previous hamstring injury.METHODS: Forty-five professional players (males: N.=19, previously injured players=4, age=21.16±2.00years; females: N.=19, previously injured players =10, age= 22.15±4.50years) performed 5 kicks each with their preferred and non-preferred limb at a target 7m away, which were recorded with a three-dimensional motion capture system.Kinematic and kinetic variables were extracted for the backswing, leg cocking, leg acceleration and follow through phases.RESULTS: A shorter backswing (20.20±3.49% vs. 25.64±4.57%),and differences in knee flexion angle (58±10º vs. 72±14º) and hip flexion velocity (8±0 rad/s vs. 10±2 rad/s) were observed in previously injured, non-preferred limb kicks for females.A lower peak hip linear velocity (3.50±0.84m/s vs. 4.10±0.45m/s) was observed in previously injured, preferred limb kicks of females.These differences occurred in the backswing and leg-cocking phases where the hamstring muscles were the most active.A variation in the functioning of the hamstring muscles and that of the gluteus maximus and iliopsoas in the case of a previous injury could account for the differences observed in the kicking pattern.CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the effects of a previous hamstring injury must be considered while designing rehabilitation programs to re-educate kicking movement.","This paper investigates how previous hamstring injuries influence kicking mechanics in soccer players, considering factors such as sex and limb dominance. The study finds significant differences in kicking performance, including variations in backswing, knee flexion angle, and hip linear velocity, highlighting the need to consider past injuries in rehabilitation protocols for kicking movements."
Lumbar stabilisation exercises versus back endurance-resistance exercise training in athletes with chronic low back pain: protocol of a randomised controlled trial,2018-11-01,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Alexandre Henrique Nowotny, Mariene Guizeline Calderon, Pablo Albuquerque de Souza, Andreo Fernando Aguiar, Guillaume Léonard, Bruno Mazziotti Oliveira Alves, Cesar Ferreira Amorim, Rubens Alexandre da Silva","Background Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is an important disorder in athletes that may negatively affect their performance in competitions. The literature usually recommends physiotherapy based on exercises for back pain management in athletes. Recent evidence suggests that interventions based on lumbar muscle stabilisation exercises (LMSE) and back endurance-resistance exercises (BERE) may improve back pain and function performance. However, it is still unclear which type of exercise is more effective for the treatment of CLBP in athletes. Objective To compare the efficacy of LMSE versus BERE in athletes with CLBP. Design The study is a 2-arm, prospectively registered, randomised controlled trial. Setting The physical therapy clinical and biomechanics laboratory of the UNOPAR University. Participants 32 male athletes with CLBP, age between 18 and 40 years old, recruited from the local community. Intervention An 8-week intervention programme will be carried out with LMSE s versus BERE. Measurements Trunk neuromuscular patterns during balance tasks (unipodal and over a ball) using electromyography and force platform parameters, pain, disability, fear and avoidance will be assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline and at follow-up after 8 weeks of intervention period. Limitations The absence of blinding intervention and the exclusion of female athletes, seated sports and swimmers will affect the internal and external validity of the study. Conclusions The results of this study will elucidate which of these two interventions promote better results in trunk neuromuscular pattern, back pain and function in male athletes with CLBP.","This paper presents a protocol for a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of lumbar muscle stabilisation exercises (LMSE) and back endurance-resistance exercises (BERE) for treating chronic low back pain (CLBP) in male athletes. The study aims to assess the impact of these interventions on pain, function, and neuromuscular patterns over an 8-week period, addressing a gap in understanding the most effective exercise strategy for managing CLBP in this population."

Such situation may predispose to the occurrence of other kinds of injuries in this position. The aim of this study was to analyze epidemiology of injuries in young soccer goalkeepers.Forty-eight soccer goalkeepers (aged:15.2±1.9 years) filled the questionnaire aimed at collecting information about all injuries sustained within 12 months before the data collection. The anthropometric data, soccer experience and information regarding the injury types and occurrence were analyzed. The injury rate proportion for acute and overuse injuries and values of injuries including the burden of the match game and training were evaluated. The level of significance was set at P<0.05.Thirty-three (68.8%) questionnaires were given back. Twenty-four (72.7%) goalkeepers reported the history of soccer related injury within a year before the survey. 52 injuries were reported. Significantly higher number of acute (76.9%) vs. overuse (23.1%) injuries was described (P=0.0012). Acute injuries involved fractures/subluxations of the fingers and thigh muscle strain/tears. The group of overuse injuries was dominated by trauma of the knee and pelvic girdle muscles. Majority of injuries occurred during training (88.5% of all injuries), and there was significant higher number of injuries sustained on artificial vs. natural grass for all, acute and overuse types of injuries (P<0.0001).Young soccer goalkeepers suffer mostly acute injuries (within the fingers of hands and muscles of thighs). It might be associated with specific characteristic of performance related to goalkeeper's position.","This study examines the epidemiology of injuries among adolescent soccer goalkeepers, focusing on the types and rates of injuries sustained in training and matches. It highlights that young goalkeepers predominantly experience acute injuries, particularly to the fingers and thigh muscles, with a significant correlation between injury occurrence and the type of playing surface."

Injury-Free Children and Adolescents: Towards Better Practice in Swedish Football (FIT project),2018-10-30,Pensoft Publishers,Research Ideas and Outcomes,"Solveig Hausken, Natalie Barker-Ruchti, Astrid Schubring, Stefan Grau","This interdisciplinary research project will produce evidence-based recommendations on how injuries in Swedish youth football (soccer) can be prevented. Fewer injuries will positively impact athlete health, performance and career longevity and have the potential to promote life-long physical activity and wellbeing. Injury pattern research demonstrates that injuries are a significant problem in (Swedish) youth sport. Football has a higher traumatic and overuse injury rate than many contact/collision sports (e.g., field hockey, basketball). In research on youth football, the incidence of overuse training injuries was measured as high as 15.4 injuries per 1000 training hours, and the incidence of traumatic and overuse match injuries was 47.5 injuries per 1000 match hours. The injury frequency is alarming and applies to the 54% of children aged 7-14 and the 39% of youths aged 15-19 years who participate in Swedish organised sports. A large body of research identifies injury risk factors and preventative strategies; however, as the recent IOC consensus statement on youth athletic development points out, the existing, mostly bio-medical knowledge does not provide effective evidence-based injury prevention strategies. To address this deficit, interdisciplinary and context-driven knowledge on injury development in youth sport is needed. The proposed project will produce scientific evidence through four consecutive studies: a) Questionnaire to register the types, frequency and management of injuries; b) Laboratory testing of biomechanical, clinical and training-specific parameters to establish individual physical and sport-specific dispositions; c) Observation of sporting contexts to understand sporting cultures, coaching methods and coach-athlete relationships; and d) Interviews with coaches and players to recognize knowledge that shapes coaching and training. The sample of youth players will be recruited from Sweden’s most popular and injury-prone sport: football. Each of the four studies will conduct its own data production and analyses, and a collective analysis will produce integrated evidence. Concrete recommendations for best sporting practice will be developed, which will serve sporting federations, sport education institutions, coaches, sport support staff and players.","The paper focuses on an interdisciplinary research project aimed at developing evidence-based recommendations to prevent injuries in Swedish youth football. It emphasizes the high incidence of injuries among young players, outlines four research studies to gather comprehensive data on injury patterns, and aims to provide actionable strategies for coaches and sport institutions to enhance athlete health and longevity."
Seasonal Changes in the Physical Performance of Elite Youth Female Soccer Players,2018-10-25,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Stacey Emmonds, Tom Sawczuk, Sean Scantlebury, Kev Till, Ben Jones","Abstract Emmonds, S, Sawczuk, T, Scantlebury, S, Till, K, and Jones, B. Seasonal changes in the physical performance of elite youth female soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(9): 2636–2643, 2020—This study investigated the seasonal change in physical performance of 113 (Under 10: U10 [ n = 20], U12 [ n = 30], U14 [ n = 31], and U16 [ n = 32]) elite youth female soccer players. Players completed testing pre-, mid-, and post-season, including speed (10- and 30-m sprint), change of direction (CoD; 505 test), power (countermovement jump [CMJ]), strength (isometric midthigh pull), and aerobic capacity (Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 [YYIRL1]). A general linear model was used to evaluate the change in physical characteristics and the influence of covariates (baseline performance; change in maturity status) on each characteristic across the season. U10's speed and CoD performance decreased from pre-post season, whereas relative strength likely improved. U12's relative strength very likely improved; however, 10-m sprint performance decreased. Relative strength likely decreased, whereas 30-m sprint and CoD time very likely improved in U14's. U16's likely improved relative strength, CMJ, and 10-m sprint, and very likely improved 30-m sprint and CoD from pre-post season. U12–U16's improved YYIRL1 performance pre-post season. Strength and conditioning coaches working with U10–U12 players should look to develop speed, lower-body power, and CoD ability as part of structured strength and conditioning sessions as well as within warm-ups before pitch-based sessions. With U14–U16 players' manipulation of small-sided games combined with short-duration high-intensity running drills may provide an efficient training stimulus to develop the aerobic system while concurrently developing technical/tactical skills.

Sprint-Specific Training in Youth: Backward Running vs. Forward Running Training on Speed and Power Measures in Adolescent Male Athletes,2018-10-25,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Aaron Uthoff, Jon Oliver, John Cronin, Craig Harrison, Paul Winwood","Abstract Uthoff, A, Oliver, J, Cronin, J, Harrison, C, and Winwood, P. Sprint-specific training in youth: Backward running vs. forward running training on speed and power measures in adolescent male athletes. J Strength Cond Res 34(4): 1113–1122, 2020—This study compared the effects of 2 sprint-specific training programs against the natural development of speed, power, and stiffness in a group of adolescent male athletes. Forty-three male adolescents (aged 13–15 years) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 training groups; backward running training (BRT = 26), or forward running training (FRT = 17). A physical education class ( n = 24) of similar age constituted a control (CON) group. Both training groups performed running sessions matched for distance and intensity biweekly for 8 weeks. Parametric and magnitude-based inferences were used to analyze within group (pre-post measures) and between group (gain scores) for 10-m, 10- to 20-m, and 20-m sprint times, vertical countermovement jump (CMJ) height, and vertical leg stiffness. Both running groups significantly improved ( p ≤ 0.05) in all performance tests from pre-training to post-training, with effect sizes ranging from −1.25 to 0.63. When the groups were compared, the BRT and FRT groups improved significantly ( p ≤ 0.01) on all sprint performances and stiffness relative to the CON group. The BRT group demonstrated favorable effects for 10-m and 20-m sprint performances (effect size [ES] = −0.47 and −0.26, respectively) and CMJ height (ES = 0.51) compared with the FRT group. These results demonstrate that forward and backward sprint-specific training programs enhance speed and power measures more than natural development in adolescent male athletes. Furthermore, the greater training responses in sprint performance and CMJ ability indicate that BRT is a useful tool for improving concentric strength and power and may be classified as a sprint-specific training method.","This study investigates the effectiveness of backward versus forward running training on speed and power in adolescent male athletes. The findings indicate that both training modalities significantly improve sprint performance and jump height compared to natural development, with backward running training showing particularly beneficial effects in enhancing sprint speed and concentric strength."
Movement Economy in Soccer: Current Data and Limitations,2018-10-23,MDPI AG,Sports,"Filippo Dolci, Nicolas H. Hart, Andrew Kilding, Paola Chivers, Ben Piggott, Tania Spiteri","Soccer is an intermittent team-sport, where performance is determined by a myriad of psychological, technical, tactical, and physical factors. Among the physical factors, endurance appears to play a key role into counteracting the fatigue-related reduction in running performance observed during soccer matches. One physiological determinant of endurance is movement economy, which represents the aerobic energy cost to exercise at a given submaximal velocity. While the role of movement economy has been extensively examined in endurance athletes, it has received little attention in soccer players, but may be an important factor, given the prolonged demands of match play. For this reason, the current review discusses the nature, impact, and trainability of movement economy specific to soccer players. A summary of current knowledge and limitations of movement economy in soccer is provided, with an insight into future research directions, to make this important parameter more valuable when assessing and training soccer players’ running performance.","The paper reviews the concept of movement economy in soccer, emphasizing its significance in relation to endurance and overall running performance during matches. It identifies the current knowledge gaps and limitations regarding movement economy in soccer players, while suggesting future research directions to enhance its assessment and training."
Comparison of Head Impact Exposure Between Concussed Football Athletes and Matched Controls: Evidence for a Possible Second Mechanism of Sport-Related Concussion,2018-10-22,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,"Brian D.

Giza, Kevin M. Guskiewicz, Jonathan Jackson, Gerald T. McGinty, Steven J. Svoboda, Thomas W. McAllister, Steven P. Broglio, Michael McCrea","Studies of football athletes have implicated repetitive head impact exposure in the onset of cognitive and brain structural changes, even in the absence of diagnosed concussion. Those studies imply accumulating damage from successive head impacts reduces tolerance and increases risk for concussion. Support for this premise is that biomechanics of head impacts resulting in concussion are often not remarkable when compared to impacts sustained by athletes without diagnosed concussion. Accordingly, this analysis quantified repetitive head impact exposure in a cohort of 50 concussed NCAA Division I FBS college football athletes compared to controls that were matched for team and position group. The analysis quantified the number of head impacts and risk weighted exposure both on the day of injury and for the season to the date of injury. 43% of concussed athletes had the most severe head impact exposure on the day of injury compared to their matched control group and 46% of concussed athletes had the most severe head impact exposure for the season to the date of injury compared to their matched control group. When accounting for date of injury or season to date of injury, 72% of all concussed athletes had the most or second most severe head impact exposure compared to their matched control group. These trends associating cumulative head impact exposure with concussion onset were stronger for athletes that participated in a greater number of contact activities. For example, 77% of athletes that participated in ten or more days of contact activities had greater head impact exposure than their matched control group. This unique analysis provided further evidence for the role of repetitive head impact exposure as a predisposing factor for the onset of concussion. The clinical implication of these findings supports contemporary trends of limiting head impact exposure for college football athletes during practice activities in an effort to also reduce risk of concussive injury.","This paper investigates the connection between repetitive head impact exposure and concussion onset in football athletes, comparing a group of concussed NCAA Division I FBS athletes to matched controls. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of concussed athletes experienced higher levels of severe head impacts, suggesting that cumulative head impact exposure may be a contributing factor to concussion risk, reinforcing the need for practices that limit head impact exposure."
Cerebral Autoregulation Is Disrupted Following a Season of Contact Sports Participation,2018-10-22,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Neurology,"Alexander D. Wright, Jonathan D. Smirl, Kelsey Bryk, Sarah Fraser, Michael Jakovac, Paul van Donkelaar","Repetitive subconcussive head impacts across a season of contact sports participation are associated with a number of deficits in brain function. To date, no research has investigated the effect of such head impact exposure on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA). To address this issue, 179 elite, junior-level (age 19.6 ± 1.5 years) contact sport (ice hockey, American football) athletes were recruited for pre-season testing. 52 non-concussed athletes returned for post-season testing. 15 non-contact sport athletes (age 20.4 ± 2.2) also completed pre- and postseason testing. dCA was assessed via recordings of beat-by-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) using finger photoplethysmography and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively, during repetitive squat-stand manoeuvres at 0.05 Hz and 0.10 Hz. Transfer function analysis was used to determine Coherence (correlation), Gain (response amplitude), and Phase (response latency) of the MAP-MCAv relationship. Results showed that in contact sport athletes, Phase was reduced (p=0.027) and Gain increased (p<0.001) at post-season compared to pre-season during the 0.10 Hz squat-stand manoeuvres, indicating cerebral autoregulatory impairment in both the latency and magnitude of the response. Changes in Phase were greater in athletes experiencing higher numbers and severity of head impacts. By contrast, no changes in dCA were observed in non-contact sport controls. Taken together, these results demonstrate that repetitive subconcussive head impacts occurring across a season of contact sports participation are associated with exposure-dependent impairments in the cerebrovascular pressure-buffering system capacity. It is unknown how long these deficits persist or if they accumulate year-over-year.","The paper investigates the impact of repetitive subconcussive head impacts from participation in contact sports on dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) in athletes. Findings indicate that contact sport athletes exhibit significant impairments in cerebral autoregulation following a season, characterized by reduced response latency and increased response amplitude, related to the severity of head impacts."
The effects of a subsequent jump on the knee abduction angle during the early landing phase,2018-10-20,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Tomoya Ishida, Yuta Koshino, Masanori Yamanaka, Ryo Ueno, Shohei Taniguchi, Mina Samukawa, Hiroshi Saito, Hisashi Matsumoto, Yoshimitsu Aoki, Harukazu Tohyama","A double-leg landing with or without a subsequent jump is commonly used to evaluate the neuromuscular control of knee abduction. However, the differences in frontal plane knee biomechanics between landings with and without a subsequent jump are not well known. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of a subsequent jump on knee abduction, including during the early landing phase, in female and male subjects. Twenty-one female subjects and 21 male subjects participated. All subjects performed drop landing task (a landing without a subsequent jump) and drop vertical jump task (a landing with a subsequent jump). The subjects landed from a 30-cm height. In drop vertical jump, the subjects also performed a maximum vertical jump immediately after landing. The knee abduction angle and moment were analyzed using a 3D motion analysis system. A two-way analysis of variance (task × time) was performed to examine the effects of a subsequent jump on the knee abduction angle during the early landing phase in female and male subjects. Another two-way analysis of variance (task × sex) was performed to compare peak knee abduction angles and moments. In female subjects, the knee abduction angle was significantly greater during drop vertical jump than during drop landing, as measured 45 to 80 ms after initial contact (P < 0.05). Significant task-dependent effects in the peak knee abduction angle (P = 0.001) and the abduction moment (P = 0.029) were detected. The peak knee abduction angle and the abduction moment were greater during drop vertical jump than during drop landing. Subsequent jumps cause greater knee abduction during the early landing phase only in female subjects. This finding may relate to the sex discrepancy in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Additionally, the presence of a subsequent jump significantly increases the peak knee abduction angle and the peak knee abduction moment during landings. Therefore, compared with a landing task without a subsequent jump (drop landing), a landing task with a subsequent jump (drop vertical jump) may be advantageous for screening for knee abduction control, especially in female athletes.","This paper investigates the impact of a subsequent jump on the knee abduction angle during the early landing phase in male and female subjects. Findings indicate that a subsequent jump significantly increases the knee abduction angle and moment, particularly in females, suggesting that such jump tasks may be beneficial for assessing knee abduction control and understanding sex-related risks for anterior cruciate ligament injuries."

N. J. Keizer, E. Otten","Anterior tibia translation (ATT) is mainly prevented by the anterior cruciate ligament. Passive ATT tests are commonly used to diagnose an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, to select patients for an ACL reconstruction (ACLR), and as an outcome measure after an ACLR. The aim of this review was to present an overview of possible factors determining ATT. A second purpose was to give a summary of the ATT measured in the literature in healthy, ACL-injured and ACLR knees and a comparison between those groups. A literature search was conducted with PubMed. Inclusion criteria were full-text primary studies published in English between January 2006 and October 2016. Studies included reported ATT in explicit data in healthy as well as ACL-injured or ACLR knees or in ACL-injured as well as ACLR knees. Sixty-one articles met inclusion criteria. Two articles measured the ATT in healthy as well as ACL-injured knees, 51 in ACL-injured as well as in ACLR knees, three in ACLR as well as in healthy knees and three in healthy, ACL-injured and ACLR knees. A difference in ATT is found between healthy, contralateral, ACLR and ACL-injured knees and between chronic and acute ACL injury. Graft choices and intra-articular injuries are factors which could affect the ATT. The mean ATT was lowest to highest in ACLR knees using a bone–patella tendon–bone autograft, ACLR knees using a hamstring autograft, contralateral healthy knees, healthy knees, ACLR knees with an allograft and ACL-injured knees. Factors which could affect the ATT are graft choice, ACL injury or reconstruction, intra-articular injuries and whether an ACL injury is chronic or acute. Comparison of ATT between studies should be taken with caution as a high number of different measurement methods are used. To be able to compare studies, more consistency in measuring devices used should be introduced to measuring ATT. The clinical relevance is that an autograft ACLR might give better results than an allograft ACLR as knee laxity is greater when using an allograft tendon. III.","This systematic review examines passive anterior tibia translation (ATT) across different knee conditions, specifically focusing on healthy, ACL-injured, and ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) knees. It highlights the variability in ATT measurements due to factors like graft choice, type of ACL injury, and intra-articular injuries, while emphasizing the need for standardized measurement methods to improve research comparability and clinical outcomes."
Modified exorotation graft tension for tibial fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized controlled trial,2018-10-12,"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia",Medical Journal of Indonesia,"Ludwig A.P. Pontoh, Ismail H. Dilogo, Saptawati Bardosono, Andri M.T. Lubis, Alida R. Harahap, Jacub Pandelaki, Mohammad Hidayat","Background: The inability of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery to reduce tibial internal rotation causes many problems. A large tibial internal rotation will result in a patellofemoral pain syndrome. This study aimed to introduce a new technique of modified exorotation graft tension at tibial fixation to minimize endorotation, reduce tibial internal rotation, and prevent patellofemoral pain syndrome.Methods: This study was a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial. ACL rupture patients underwent ACLR surgery between December 2014 and Februrary 2015. They were randomized to standard endorotation group or modified exorotation group. Hamstring autograft was used and fixed with an EndoButton® and bioabsorbable interference screw. Tibial tubercle to trochlear grove (TTTG) was used to evaluate rotation, whereas cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was employed to analyze cartilage breakdown. The functional outcome was measured using the Kujala score to assess patellofemoral joint function. Evaluations were conducted before the surgery and at 6 months postoperation.Results: A total of 29 subjects were recruited. Sixteen subjects were allocated into the standard endorotation group, and 13 were assigned to the modified exorotation group. The exorotation group demonstrated better results than the endorotation group in all three parameters: TTTG (p=0.028), COMP (p&lt;0.001), and Kujala score (p=0.015).Conclusion: A new technique of modified exorotation direction of graft tension for ACL reconstructive surgery at tibial fixation showed a significant reduction in tibial internal rotation and cartilage breakdown. The proposed method could significantly improve the functional outcome of those with total ACL rupture.","This paper investigates a new technique of modified exorotation graft tension for tibial fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery, aiming to minimize tibial internal rotation and associated patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Comparing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk Variables Between Unanticipated Cutting and Decelerating Tasks,2018-10-09,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Shelby A. Peel, Lauren E. Schroeder, Zachary A. Sievert, Joshua T. Weinhandl","To examine the relationship between anterior cruciate ligament injury risk factors in unanticipated cutting and decelerating. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected on 11 females (22 [2] y, 1.67 [0.08] m, and 68.5 [9.8] kg) during 2 unanticipated tasks. Paired samples t tests were performed to compare dependent variables between tasks. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the relationship between peak internal knee adduction moment and peak anterior tibial shear force (ASF) during 2 unanticipated tasks. Significantly greater knee abduction angles, peak knee adduction moments, and peak ASFs were observed during cutting (P ≤ .05). A strong positive correlation existed between decelerating ASF and cutting ASF (ρ = .67), while correlations between decelerating knee adduction moment and cutting knee adduction moment and decelerating ASF and cutting knee adduction moment were not significant. In situations where time management is a necessity and only one task can be evaluated, it may be more appropriate to utilize an unanticipated cutting task rather than an unanticipated deceleration task because of the increased knee adduction moment and ASF. These data can help future clinicians in better designing more effective anterior cruciate ligament injury risk screening methods.","This paper investigates the risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries during unanticipated cutting and decelerating tasks by analyzing three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces in female athletes. Key findings indicate that unanticipated cutting results in significantly greater knee abduction angles and peak knee adduction moments compared to deceleration, suggesting that evaluating cutting tasks may be more effective for ACL injury risk screening."
The Efficacy of Lower-Limb Screening Tests in Predicting PlayerLoad Within a Professional Soccer Academy,2018-10-09,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Charlie Bowen, Kristian Weaver, Nicola Relph, Matt Greig","Context : Training exposure has been associated with injury epidemiology in elite youth soccer, where lower-limb musculoskeletal screening is commonly used to highlight injury risk. However, there has been little consideration of the relationship between lower-limb screening and the loading response to soccer activities. Objective : To quantify the efficacy of using screening tests to predict the loading elicited in soccer-specific activities and to develop a hierarchical ordering of musculoskeletal screening tests to identify test redundancy and inform practice. Design : Correlational. Setting : Professional soccer club academy. Participants : A total of 21 elite male soccer players aged 15.7 (0.9) years. Intervention : Players completed a battery of 5 screening tests (knee to wall, hip internal rotation, adductor squeeze, single-leg hop, and anterior reach) and a 25-minute standardized soccer session with a Global Positioning System unit placed at C7 to collect multiplanar PlayerLoad data. Main Outcome Measures : Baseline data on each screening test, along with uniaxial PlayerLoad in the mediolateral, anteroposterior, and vertical planes. Results : Stepwise hierarchical modeling of the screening tests revealed that dominant leg knee-to-wall distance was the most prevalent and powerful predictor of multiplanar PlayerLoad, accounting for up to 42% of variation in uniaxial loading. The adductor squeeze test was the least powerful predictor of PlayerLoad. Of note, one player who incurred a knee injury within 3 weeks of testing had shown a 20% reduction in knee-to-wall distance compared with peers, and elicited 23% greater PlayerLoad, supporting the hierarchical model. Conclusions : There was some evidence of redundancy in the screening battery, with implications for clinical choice. Hierarchical ordering and a concurrent case study highlight dominant leg knee-to-wall distance as the primary predictor of multiaxial loading in soccer. This has implications for the design and interpretation of screening data in elite youth soccer.","The paper evaluates the effectiveness of lower-limb screening tests in predicting PlayerLoad during soccer-specific activities among elite youth players. It identifies dominant leg knee-to-wall distance as a significant predictor of loading, suggesting that the screening protocol may benefit from a hierarchical approach to optimize injury risk assessment and improve clinical practices in soccer training."
Analysis of the biomechanical characteristics of the knee joint with a meniscus injury,2018-10-02,Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET),Healthcare Technology Letters,Tiguai Zhou,"The knee joint is one of the most important joints in the human body. The meniscus is a half-moon cartilage which locates between the medial and lateral condyle of the thighbone and the medial and lateral condyle of the shin in the knee joint, and it has multiple functions such as bearing load, cushioning and stabilising joints. It is easy to be injured because of its complex structure and functions. In this study, the physical fitness of patients with meniscus injury was tested using kinematic measurement, and the data were collected for biomechanical analysis on the parameters such as the angle and stress when the patient's bent knees during sports. The results demonstrated that the average values of bending angle, the rotation angle of the knee joint and intensity of pressure of the patients with meniscus injury were remarkably different with those of people without meniscus injury. Biomechanical characteristics are of extensive values to the treatment of meniscus injury.","This paper examines the biomechanical characteristics of the knee joint in patients with meniscus injuries, highlighting its importance in load-bearing and joint stabilization.

A Phase Variable Approach to Volitional Control of Powered Knee-Ankle Prostheses,2018-10-01,IEEE,2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"Siavash Rezazadeh, David Quintero, Nikhil Divekar, Robert D. Gregg","Although there has been recent progress in control of multi-joint prosthetic legs for periodic tasks such as walking, volitional control of these systems for non-periodic maneuvers is still an open problem. In this paper, we develop a new controller that is capable of both periodic walking and common volitional leg motions based on a piecewise holonomic phase variable through a finite state machine. The phase variable is constructed by measuring the thigh angle, and the transitions in the finite state machine are formulated through sensing foot contact together with attributes of a nominal reference gait trajectory. The controller was implemented on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis and tested with a transfemoral amputee subject, who successfully performed a wide range of periodic and non-periodic tasks, including low- and high-speed walking, quick start and stop, backward walking, walking over obstacles, and kicking a soccer ball. The proposed approach is expected to provide better understanding of volitional motions and lead to more reliable control of multi-joint prostheses for a wider range of tasks.","This paper presents a novel controller for powered knee-ankle prostheses that enables volitional control for both periodic and non-periodic movements, addressing the current limitations in prosthetic technology. The controller, which operates based on a piecewise holonomic phase variable and a finite state machine, was effectively tested with a transfemoral amputee, enabling a variety of tasks including walking and kicking a soccer ball."
Foot and Ankle Injuries in Soccer,2018-10-01,"Frontline Medical Communications, Inc.",American Journal of Orthopedics,"Enrique Feria-Arias, Karim Boukhemis, Christopher Kreulen, Eric Giza","The ankle is one of the most commonly injured joints in soccer and represents a significant cost to the healthcare system. The ligaments that stabilize the ankle joint determine its biomechanics-alterations of which result from various soccer-related injuries. Acute sprains are among the most common injury in soccer players and are generally treated conservatively, with emphasis placed on secondary prevention to reduce the risk for future sprains and progression to chronic ankle instability. Repetitive ankle injuries in soccer players may cause chronic ankle instability, which includes both mechanical ligamentous laxity and functional changes. Chronic ankle pathology often requires surgery to repair ligamentous damage and remove soft-tissue or osseous impingement. Proper initial treatment, rehabilitation, and secondary prevention of ankle injuries can limit the amount of time lost from play and avoid negative long-term sequelae (eg, osteochondral lesions, arthritis). On the other hand, high ankle sprains portend a poorer prognosis and a longer recovery. These injuries will typically require surgical stabilization. Impingement-like syndromes of the ankle can undergo an initial trial of conservative treatment; when this fails, however, soccer players respond favorably to arthroscopic debridement of the lesions causing impingement. Finally, other pathologies (eg, stress fractures) are highly encouraged to be treated with surgical stabilization in elite soccer players.","This paper focuses on the prevalence and treatment of ankle injuries in soccer, highlighting that acute sprains are the most common injuries which often lead to chronic instability if not properly managed. It emphasizes the importance of initial treatment, rehabilitation, and preventive measures to reduce recovery time and avoid long-term complications, while also discussing the necessity for surgical intervention in severe cases and for certain chronic conditions."
Concussion with primary impact to the chest and the potential role of neck tension,2018-10-01,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Ron Jadischke, David C Viano, Joe McCarthy, Albert I King","Objectives Most biomechanical research on brain injury focuses on direct blows to the head. There are a few older studies that indicate craniocervical stretch could be a factor in concussion by causing strain in the upper spinal cord and brainstem. The objectives of this study are to assess the biomechanical response and estimate the strain in the upper cervical spine and brainstem from primary impact to the chest in American football. Methods Impact testing was conducted to the chest of a stationary unhelmeted and helmeted anthropomorphic test device (ATD) as well as the laboratory reconstruction of two NFL game collisions resulting in concussion. A finite element (FE) study was also conducted to estimate the elongation of the cervical spine under tensile and flexion loading conditions. Results The helmeted ATD had a 40% (t=9.84, p&lt;0.001) increase in neck tensile force and an 8% (t=7.267, p&lt;0.001) increase in neck flexion angle when compared with an unhelmeted ATD. The case studies indicated that the neck tension in the injured players exceeded tolerable levels from volunteer studies. The neck tension was combined with flexion of the head relative to the torso. The FE analysis, combined with a spinal cord coupling ratio, estimated that the strain along the axis of the upper cervical spinal cord and brainstem was 10%–20% for the combined flexion and tension loading in the two cases presented. Conclusion Strain in the upper spinal cord and brainstem from neck tension is a factor in concussion.","This paper investigates the relationship between impacts to the chest and their potential role in causing concussions in American football, with a focus on the biomechanical response and strain in the cervical spine and brainstem. The study employs impact testing and finite element analysis to demonstrate that increased neck tension, particularly in helmeted athletes, may contribute significantly to concussion risk during collisions."

Injury prevention programs based on flywheel vs. body weight resistance in recreational athletes. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S188–S196, 2021—This study compares the effect of an isoinertial flywheel technology vs. a traditional gravity-dependent exercise protocol on modifiable factors associated with the incidence of hamstring strain (HAM) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Furthermore, the effect on repeated sprint ability was also considered. Eighteen recreationally trained volleyball players completed one of the following 6-week protocols: (a) flywheel (FY) included 3 exercises using a YoYo isoinertial-squat machine and 3 exercises with a Versa-Pulley isoinertial device, and (b) gravity-dependent (GT) involved 6 similar exercises with no external resistance (participants' body weight). Both programs consisted in 2 sessions·wk −1 performing 2 sets of 8 repetitions with 2 minutes of rest. Outcomes included a 10-second tuck jump assessment (TJA), landing knee valgus score, hamstring and quadriceps concentric and eccentric isokinetic 60°·s −1 peak torque, optimal peak torque localization, conventional and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, and 30-m repeated shuttle sprint ability (RSSA) test. FY improved TJA (−2, interquartile range [IQR] = −3 to −1) and valgus (−1, IQR = −1 to 0) scores, hamstring eccentric (20.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.27–31.47 N·m) and concentric (17.87, 95% CI = 0.40–35.34 N·m) peak torque, as well as the RSSA (−0.28, 95% CI = −0.45 to −0.10 seconds), whereas GT only improved hamstring eccentric peak torque (21.41, 95% CI = 9.00–33.82 N·m). A 6-week protocol using flywheel technology seems to elicit better positive adaptations to protect athletes from HAM and ACL injuries and to enhance RSSA performance compared to exercising with no external resistance other than athletes' body weight.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of injury prevention programs using flywheel resistance technology versus traditional body weight exercises among recreational volleyball players. The findings indicate that the flywheel program leads to greater improvements in key injury risk factors and performance metrics, specifically related to hamstring strength and sprint ability."
Reducing the Energy Cost of Human Running Using an Unpowered Exoskeleton,2018-09-28,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,"Rezvan Nasiri, Arjang Ahmadi, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi","In this paper, we present a new perspective to design an unpowered exoskeleton for metabolic rate reduction in running. According to our studies on human biomechanics, it was observed that having a torsional spring that applies torque as a linear function of the difference between two hips angles ( -angle), compared with a local spring which applies torque as a function of hip angle ( -angle), provides a better condition for hip moment compensation and, consequently, metabolic rate reduction. Accordingly, a new type of unpowered exoskeleton device for realization of this idea was designed, and a prototype of this exoskeleton was constructed. This exoskeleton was tested on 10 healthy active subjects for running at 2.5 m s-1. In this experiment, 8.0 ± 1.5% (mean ± s.e.m.) metabolic rate reduction (compared with the no-exoskeleton case) was achieved.",The paper presents the design and testing of an unpowered exoskeleton aimed at reducing the energy cost of human running.

Enhanced Body Composition and Physical Fitness in Prepubescent Soccer Players,2018-09-21,Modestum Publishing Ltd,Pedagogical Research,Bahar Ateş,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of soccer activities on body composition and physical fitness among prepubertal boys. A total of 38 prepubescent male soccer players (mean age, 12.1±0.13 years) were compared with 41 participants in control group (mean age, 12.4±0.06 years). The body composition was measured using the bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) method (Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan). 30m sprint (T30), agility T-Test, and Sit-And-Reach (S&R) Tests were performed from different motor fitness test batteries. Student's unpaired t-test revealed that soccer and control groups were similar in age, height, body mass, BMI and lean body mass (LBM), but the control group had higher percentage of body fat (%BF) than the soccer group (p < 0.05). Also, pearson correlation analysis showed a significant moderate positive correlation between %BF and T30 (r = 0.62; p = 0.00), and a significant lower positive correlation between agility T-Test and S&R test (r = 0.35; p = 0.00, r = 0.42; p = 0.00), respectively.

How sprinters accelerate beyond the velocity plateau of soccer players: Waveform analysis of ground reaction forces,2018-09-19,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Steffi L. Colyer, Ryu Nagahara, Yohei Takai, Aki I. T. Salo","Abstract Forces applied to the ground during sprinting are vital to performance. This study aimed to understand how specific aspects of ground reaction force waveforms allow some individuals to continue to accelerate beyond the velocity plateau of others. Twenty‐eight male sprint specialists and 24 male soccer players performed maximal‐effort 60‐m sprints. A 54‐force‐plate system captured ground reaction forces, which were used to calculate horizontal velocity profiles. Touchdown velocities of steps were matched (8.00, 8.25, and 8.50 m/s), and the subsequent ground contact forces were analyzed. Mean forces were compared across groups and statistical parametric mapping ( t tests) assessed for differences between entire force waveforms. When individuals contacted the ground with matched horizontal velocity, ground contact durations were similar. Despite this, sprinters produced higher average horizontal power (15.7‐17.9 W/kg) than the soccer players (7.9‐11.9 W/kg). Force waveforms did not differ in the initial braking phase (0%‐~20% of stance). However, sprinters attenuated eccentric force more in the late braking phase and produced a higher antero‐posterior component of force across the majority of the propulsive phase, for example, from 31%‐82% and 92%‐100% of stance at 8.5 m/s. At this velocity, resultant forces were also higher (33%‐83% and 86%‐100% of stance) and the force vector was more horizontally orientated (30%‐60% and 95%‐98% of stance) in the sprinters. These findings illustrate the mechanisms which allowed the sprinters to continue accelerating beyond the soccer players’ velocity plateau. Moreover, these force production demands provide new insight regarding athletes’ strength and technique training requirements to improve acceleration at high velocity.","This paper investigates the differences in ground reaction force waveforms between sprinters and soccer players during maximal sprinting efforts to understand why sprinters can accelerate beyond the velocity plateau experienced by soccer players. The study highlights that sprinters exhibit higher horizontal power output and distinct force production characteristics during the late braking and propulsive phases, emphasizing the implications for athletes' strength and technique training."
Using wearable sensors to classify subject-specific running biomechanical gait patterns based on changes in environmental weather conditions,2018-09-18,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Nizam Uddin Ahamed, Dylan Kobsar, Lauren Benson, Christian Clermont, Russell Kohrs, Sean T. Osis, Reed Ferber","Running-related overuse injuries can result from a combination of various intrinsic (e.g., gait biomechanics) and extrinsic (e.g., running surface) risk factors. However, it is unknown how changes in environmental weather conditions affect running gait biomechanical patterns since these data cannot be collected in a laboratory setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a classification model based on subject-specific changes in biomechanical running patterns across two different environmental weather conditions using data obtained from wearable sensors in real-world environments. Running gait data were recorded during winter and spring sessions, with recorded average air temperatures of -10° C and +6° C, respectively. Classification was performed based on measurements of pelvic drop, ground contact time, braking, vertical oscillation of pelvis, pelvic rotation, and cadence obtained from 66,370 strides (~11,000/runner) from a group of recreational runners. A non-linear and ensemble machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF), was used to classify and compute a heuristic for determining the importance of each variable in the prediction model. To validate the developed subject-specific model, two cross-validation methods (one-against-another and partitioning datasets) were used to obtain experimental mean classification accuracies of 87.18% and 95.42%, respectively, indicating an excellent discriminatory ability of the RF-based model. Additionally, the ranked order of variable importance differed across the individual runners. The results from the RF-based machine-learning algorithm demonstrates that processing gait biomechanical signals from a single wearable sensor can successfully detect changes to an individual's running patterns based on data obtained in real-world environments.","This paper investigates how environmental weather conditions influence subject-specific running biomechanical gait patterns by using wearable sensors. The study establishes a classification model based on running gait data collected under different temperatures, achieving high accuracy in differentiating biomechanical signals and demonstrating the capability of the model to detect individual changes in running patterns in real-world settings."

Design: Participants completed three baseline cognitive tasks. Then, participants performed three jump-landing trials per condition (dual-task trials (DT)): Stroop Color Word test (SCWT), Symbol Digits Modalities test (SDMT), Brooks Visuospatial task (BVT), and no concurrent cognitive task (single-task). Main Outcome Measures: Total Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) scores were used to evaluate movement patterns. Participant’s reaction time (RT) for the jump-landing task was recorded.

These injuries may lead to significant absence from activity with an associated financial and social burden. No definitive association has been described between mechanism of injury and pathology to enable us to put preventative measures in place in order to limit these injuries.&#x0D; Aim&#x0D; To determine whether there is an association between the mechanism of injury and the pathology seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries.&#x0D; Methods&#x0D; This was a cross-sectional analytical study. Eighty seven male patients with an ACL injury, who had an MRI scan of the knee within the last two years participated in this study. Participants were contacted to give consent that their information be used in this study. The mechanism of injury and the pathology seen on the MRI scan was noted and categorised into different mechanism of injury groups and associated pathology groups. Statistical analyses included summaries of the data and a test for association between mechanism of injury and pathology. Since there were multiple pathology responses to each mechanism, a modified version of the chi-square test for independence was used. A 5% level of significance was specified.&#x0D; Results&#x0D; MRI scans of ACL injuries indicated that the mechanism of a solid foot plant with rotation of the knee has a greater tendency to be associated with medial meniscal injuries (77%), and also a 54% possibility to be associated with lateral meniscal injuries. A solid foot plant with a valgus stress on the knee showed a higher incidence of associated medial collateral ligaments (MCL) injuries (41%) and femoral bone bruising (62 %). These two mechanisms of injury are the most common in ACL injuries and contribute to the clinical significance found in this study. The p-value was however not statistically significant (p=0.44, chi-square value=20.27, df=45) for any association between pathology and mechanism of injury.&#x0D; Conclusion&#x0D; Some injury mechanisms causing ACL injury were more common than others and also had more associated pathology. The most common mechanism of injury noted is a solid foot plant with either rotation of the knee or valgus stress on the knee. Strengthening tissue structures involved in those movement patterns that cause these mechanisms can possibly limit ACL injuries in athletes and the general public.&#x0D; Key words&#x0D; Anterior cruciate ligament injury, mechanism, association, pathology, MRI scan, prevention.","The paper investigates the association between the mechanism of injury and the pathology observed in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries among male athletes.

J Strength Cond Res 34(8): 2321–2328, 2020—The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of maturity status on the physical characteristics of youth female soccer players. One hundred fifty-seven players from 3 elite soccer academies in England completed assessments of anthropometry, strength (isometric midthigh pull), lower-body power (countermovement jump [CMJ]), aerobic capacity (Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1), change of direction (CoD: 505-left/right), and speed (10 and 30 m). Each player was classified into 1 of 6 maturity groups based on their estimated years from peak height velocity (YPHV). Magnitude-based inferences were used to assess for the practical significance between consecutive groups. Speed, CoD time, CMJ, and aerobic capacity were all possibly most likely better in more mature players. However, there was a likely difference in relative peak force between maturity groups −0.5 YPHV (27.13 ± 4.24 N·Kg −1 ) and 0.5 YPHV (24.62 ± 3.70 N·Kg −1 ), which was associated with a likely difference in 10-m sprint time (−0.5 YPHV: 2.00 ± 0.12 vs. 0.5 YPHV 2.08 ± 0.16 seconds) and unclear changes in CMJ and CoD time. Findings provide novel comparative data for this cohort relative to maturity status and can be used by strength and conditioning coaches to inform the design of training programs for youth female soccer players. Strength and conditioning coaches should be aware that youth female soccer players may experience a decrease in relative strength around peak height velocity, which may impact upon the speed, CoD time, and CMJ of players.","This study examines how maturity status affects the physical characteristics of elite youth female soccer players, analyzing factors such as strength, power, aerobic capacity, and speed.

Kinematic and electromyographic analysis of the Askling L‐Protocol for hamstring training,2018-09-01,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Giacomo Severini, Donal Holland, Aisling Drumgoole, Eamonn Delahunt, Massimiliano Ditroilo","Hamstring injuries are common in field sport athletes. Eccentric strength training of the hamstring muscles is an integral component of rehabilitation programs. The Askling L-Protocol comprises three exercises [extender; diver; glider] that load the hamstrings during eccentric activity. When compared to a conventional exercise-based rehabilitation program, the Askling L-Protocol has been shown to reduce the time to return to sport following hamstring injury and prevalence of injury recurrence. Nevertheless, the mechanisms behind its efficacy have yet to be studied. In this work, we conducted a kinematic and electromyographic analysis of the exercises of the Askling L-Protocol. Eleven healthy individuals performed each of the exercises while electromyographic data from four muscles (including two hamstring muscles) were recorded. Hip and knee angular displacements and velocities were also synchronously recorded using a motion capture system. We found that the L-Protocol elicits a maximal contraction (up to 60% of the MVC in the glider exercise) in the hamstring muscles at a work point similar to the swing phase of running (around 62 degrees hip flexion and 23 degrees knee flexion). No difference in the levels of activation of the hamstrings was observed between the diver and glider, regardless of the different functional role they had in the two exercises. During the extender, the hamstring muscles are stretched and minimally engaged. Finally, co-activation analysis highlighted that through the combination of passive stretch and active eccentric contraction, the hamstrings are trained to co-activate using similar structural modules employed differentially to drive the movement or stabilize it.","This paper focuses on the kinematic and electromyographic analysis of the Askling L-Protocol, a rehabilitation method aimed at hamstring injuries common in field sport athletes. Key findings suggest that the protocol effectively engages hamstring muscles during eccentric exercises, highlighting their activation patterns and co-activation dynamics, which contribute to improving rehabilitation outcomes and reducing injury recurrence."

SOME ASPECTS OF RUNNING EFFICIENCY ASSESSMENT,2018-09-01,FSAEIHE South Ural State University (National Research University),Human. Sport. Medicine,"V Demidov, F Mavliev, A Nazarenko, V Demidova","Aim. The article deals with the assessment of the approach to efficiency analysis of the selected locomotion based on the assessment of oxygen consumption per mass unit (VO2/kg/km) in participants with various morphological statuses. Materials and methods. We assessed aerobic capacity in male runners (middle and long distances, n = 7), orienteering athletes (n = 7), hockey players (n = 17), football players (n = 25), swimmers (n = 24), tennis and badminton players (n = 10). The participants have a rank from First-Class Athlete to Master of Sport of the Russian Federation. We used load tests with increasing load: 2-minute warm up, test load increasing by 1 km/h per minute starting from 7 km/h, 2-minute cool down. We conducted tests with the help of Cosmos Quasar treadmill and Metalyzer 3B gas analyzer (Germany). Results. Athletes from different groups did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in running efficiency depending on speed. There are no intergroup differences in terms of oxygen consumption during the test. Oxygen consumption at different speeds does not change significantly depending on the kind of sport. Efficiency assessment requires using parameters which do not include fat component. Conclusion. The calculation of oxygen consumption per unit of fat-free mass allowed us to reflect most accurately the efficiency of running techniques without complex systems of video analysis and taking into account different speed and acceleration components of the barycenter as well as other details of biomechanical efficiency. This is very important at the beginning of sports specialization when, apart from physiological development and adaptation, it is possible to assess and correct running technique efficiency.","The paper investigates the assessment of running efficiency in athletes by evaluating oxygen consumption per mass unit (VO2/kg/km) across various sports disciplines. Key findings indicate that there are no significant differences in running efficiency among athletes of different sports, and the study suggests that using fat-free mass to calculate oxygen consumption provides a more accurate evaluation of running techniques."

"The influence of differences in neurocognitive function on lower limb kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity during an unanticipated cutting motion",2018-08-29,Japanese Physical Therapy Association,Physical Therapy Research,"Satoshi SHIBATA, Masahiro TAKEMURA, Shumpei MIYAKAWA","Background Neurocognitive function may be a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury by changing neuromuscular control such as muscle activities. However, the effect of differences in neurocognitive function on biomechanics and neuromuscular control related to ACL injury risk is not clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of differences in neurocognitive function on biomechanics and neuromuscular control during an unanticipated side-step cutting motion. Method The subjects were 15 collegiate female athletes who were divided into two groups using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). The experimental task was an unanticipated side-step cutting motion from a 30 cm high box. We calculated joint angles and moments using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system from the dominant leg, and measured muscle activities using a surface electromyography. We calculated the co-contraction ratio (CCR) as relative muscle activity of the quadriceps to the hamstring. Results As a result, subjects with a lower SDMT score had significantly increased quadriceps activity before and after ground contact and decreased CCR only after ground contact. Conclusion In the lower SDMT score group, the quadriceps showed stronger muscle activity than the hamstring during an unanticipated side-step cutting motion. This dominant quadriceps muscle activity has been reported to increase the load on the ACL, and there was a possibility of increasing the risk of the ACL injury. Considering these factors, subjects with lower neurocognitive function could have a high risk of ACL injury due to alterations in muscle activities surrounding the knee.","This paper investigates the relationship between neurocognitive function and lower limb kinematics and muscle activity during an unanticipated cutting motion, specifically in collegiate female athletes. The study finds that athletes with lower neurocognitive function exhibited increased quadriceps activity, which may elevate the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury due to altered neuromuscular control."
Effects of an Intervention Program on Lower Extremity Biomechanics in Stop-Jump and Side-Cutting Tasks,2018-08-27,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Chen Yang, Wanxiang Yao, William E. Garrett, Deborah L. Givens, Jonathon Hacke, Hui Liu, Bing Yu","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common injuries in sport. To reduce the risk of noncontact ACL injury, it is critical to understand the effects of an intervention program on neuromuscular control–related biomechanical risk factors. Hypothesis: A newly developed 4-week intervention program would significantly increase the knee flexion angle at peak impact posterior ground-reaction force and would significantly decrease the peak impact posterior and vertical ground-reaction forces in the stop-jump and side-cutting tasks, while the intervention effects would be retained after the training was completed. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 22 male and 18 female collegiate basketball and volleyball players with biomechanical characteristics associated with increased risk of ACL injury were recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group executed a program to improve landing techniques through strength and plyometric training 3 times a week for 4 weeks while participating in their regular training. The control group participated in only their regular training for 4 weeks. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data in the stop-jump and side-cutting tasks were collected at week 0 (the beginning of the study) and at the ends of weeks 4, 8, 16, and 20. Knee flexion angle and ground-reaction forces were calculated. Analyses of variance with a mixed design were performed to determine the intervention effects and the retention of intervention effects for each sex. Results: Male participants in the intervention group significantly increased the knee flexion angle at peak impact posterior ground-reaction force in the stop-jump task at weeks 8, 12, and 20 when compared with that at week 0 and with the male control group ( P ≤ .002). No significant intervention effects on knee flexion angle and ground-reaction force were found in the side-cutting task for male participants. No significant interaction effects on takeoff velocities were detected in any task for male participants. No significant intervention effects on knee flexion angle and ground-reaction force were found in any task for female participants. Vertical takeoff velocity in the stop-jump task was significantly lower in the intervention group at week 20 compared with the control group ( P = .011). Conclusion: A 4-week intervention program significantly increased the knee flexion angle at peak impact posterior ground-reaction force of male collegiate athletes in the stop-jump task without significant effect on the performance of the task. This intervention effect was retained for at least 16 weeks after the training was completed. The intervention program, however, did not affect knee flexion angle and ground-reaction force in any task for female collegiate athletes. A reduction in vertical takeoff velocity of the stop-jump task was observed for female collegiate athletes 16 weeks after the intervention. Clinical Relevance: The intervention program with strength conditioning and plyometric exercises could modify landing biomechanics of male collegiate athletes in a stop-jump task. The intervention program may be a useful tool for preventing noncontact ACL injury for male collegiate athletes.","This paper investigates the effects of a 4-week intervention program on lower extremity biomechanics, specifically in the context of stop-jump and side-cutting tasks, to mitigate the risk of ACL injuries in collegiate athletes. The study found that the intervention significantly increased knee flexion angles in male participants during the stop-jump task and suggested potential long-term retention of this effect; however, no significant changes were observed for female athletes or in the side-cutting task."
Strength-Endurance Training Reduces the Hamstrings Strength Decline Following Simulated Football Competition in Female Players,2018-08-24,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Anne Delextrat, Jessica Piquet, Martyn J. Matthews, Daniel D. Cohen","Hamstring strains are the most common injury in multiple sprint sports, with inadequate eccentric hamstring strength and fatigue identified as important risk factors. Resistance training interventions aimed at reducing injury risk typically focus on the development of maximum strength, while little is known about the impact of training on hamstring fatigue resistance. The present study compared the effects of strength endurance (SE) with a strength intervention (S) on the eccentric hamstring strength decline induced by a simulated soccer match. Twenty-one female soccer players were randomly assigned to a S group (n = 10) or a SE group (n = 11). Hamstrings and quadriceps isokinetic concentric and eccentric peak torque (PT) were assessed at 120°.s-1 and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (HEcc:QCon) calculated, pre- and immediately post a 90-min simulated match (BEAST90). This was repeated following a 7-week intervention of either three to five sets of 6RM leg curl and stiff-leg deadlift with 3-min inter-set rest (S), or the same exercises performed using three sets of 12-20 RM with 45-90 s inter-set rest (SE). At baseline, the simulated match led to significant declines in hamstrings eccentric peak torque (EccPT) in both groups in both dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) legs [SE: (D: -15.5, ND: -15.6%), P = 0.001 to 0.016; S: (D: -12.3%, ND: -15.5%), P = 0.001 to 0.018]. After the 7-week intervention, we observed a group∗intervention∗match interaction such that there was no significant decline in EccPT in the SE group following the simulated match (D: 5.3%, ND: 2.0%), but there remained significant declines in the S group (D: -14.2%, ND: -15.5%, P = 0.018-0.001). Similarly, in the SE group, there was a significant decrease in the HEcc:QCon in D before (-14.2%, P = 0.007), but not after the training intervention, whereas declines were observed in the S group both at baseline, and following the intervention (D: -13.9%, ND: -15.6%, P = 0.045). These results demonstrate that SE training can reduce the magnitude of the EccPT decline observed during soccer competition. As inadequate eccentric strength and fatigue are both risk factors for hamstring injury, SE training should be considered along with the development of peak eccentric strength, as a component of programs aimed at reducing injury risk in multiple-sprint sports.","The paper investigates the effects of strength-endurance training on eccentric hamstring strength decline following a simulated soccer match in female players. The findings demonstrate that strength-endurance training effectively mitigates the decline in eccentric peak torque, which could be crucial for reducing hamstring injury risk in soccer."
Inter-individual Variability in Responses to 7 Weeks of Plyometric Jump Training in Male Youth Soccer Players,2018-08-20,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Rodrigo Ramirez-Campillo, Cristian Alvarez, Paulo Gentil, Jason Moran, Felipe García-Pinillos, Alicia M.

In a single-blinded study, participants aged between 10 and 16 years were randomly divided into a PJT group (n=38) and a control group (n=38). The experimental group participated in a PJT programme twice weekly for 7 weeks, whereas the control group continued with their regular soccer training sessions. Between-group differences were examined using a Mann-Whitney U test. Non-responders (NR) where defined as individuals who failed to demonstrate any beneficial change that was greater than two times the typical error of measurement (TE) from zero. The results indicated that the mean group improvement for all physical fitness measures was greater (p<0.05) in the PJT group (∆ = 0.4% to 23.3%; ES = 0.04 to 0.58) than in the control group (∆ = 0.1% to 3.8%; ES = 0.02 to 0.35). In addition, a significantly greater (p<0.05) number of responders across all dependent variables was observed in the PJT group (from 4 up to 33 responders) than in the control group (from 0 up to 9 responders). In conclusion, compared to soccer training only, PJT induced greater physical fitness improvements in youth soccer players, with a greater number of responders for all the physical fitness tests related to jumping, speed, change of direction speed, endurance, and kicking technical ability.","The study examines the effects of a 7-week plyometric jump training (PJT) program on various physical fitness measures in youth soccer players.

Changes in biomechanical knee injury risk factors across two collegiate soccer seasons using the 11+ prevention program,2018-08-17,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Amelia J. H. Arundale, Holly J. Silvers‐Granelli, Adam Marmon, Ryan Zarzycki, Celeste Dix, Lynn Snyder‐Mackler","The 11+ injury prevention program effectively reduces injuries in high school‐aged female soccer player, but the mechanism of the 11+ is unknown, particularly whether it impacts biomechanical risk factors associated with knee injuries. The purpose of this study was to report the changes in hip and knee biomechanics with use of the 11+ over two soccer seasons. Two collegiate women's soccer teams performed the 11+ for two soccer seasons. A control team was followed for one season. Athletes performed motion analysis of a drop vertical jump during preseason and postseason. Both groups had meaningful increases in peak knee abduction angle over the first season, and there were no meaningful changes in peak knee abduction moment over either season. The control group had bilateral decreases in knee flexion angle. The program did not seem to systematically impact biomechanical risk factors associated with knee injuries, with increases in peak knee abduction angle and no bilateral changes in frontal or transverse hip motion. The 11+ may have mitigated clinically meaningful decreases in knee flexion; however, as ACL injuries do not occur purely in the sagittal plane, it is unclear the impact of these changes. The results of this study indicate that the 11+ may require some modifications to impact landing biomechanics and potentially risky movement patterns, particularly when used in collegiate women over multiple seasons.","This study investigates the impact of the 11+ injury prevention program on knee and hip biomechanics in collegiate women's soccer players across two seasons. Results indicate that while the program did not systematically affect key biomechanical risk factors for knee injuries, it may have mitigated reductions in knee flexion, suggesting potential areas for modification in the program to enhance its effectiveness."
Behaviors of shooter and goalkeeper interact to determine the outcome of soccer penalties,2018-08-16,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Andrew H. Hunter, Michael J. Angilletta, Robbie S. Wilson","During a soccer penalty, the shooter's strategy and the goalkeeper's strategy interact to determine the outcome. However, most models of penalty success overlook its interactive nature. Here, we quantified aspects of shooter and goalkeeper strategies that interact to influence the outcome of soccer penalties—namely, how the speed of the shot affects the goalkeeper's leave time or shot‐blocking success, and the effectiveness of deceptive strategies. We competed 7 goalkeepers and 17 shooters in a series of penalty shoot‐out competitions with a total of 1278 shots taken. Each player was free to use any strategy within the rules of a penalty shot, and game‐like pressure was created via monetary incentive for goal‐scoring (or blocking). We found that faster shots lead to earlier leave times and were less likely blocked by goalkeepers, and—unlike most previous studies—that deceptive shooting strategies did not decrease the likelihood goalkeepers moved in the correct direction. To help identify optimal strategies for shooters and goalkeepers, we generated distributions and mathematical functions sport scientists can use to develop more comprehensive models of penalty success.","This paper investigates the interactive strategies between shooters and goalkeepers during soccer penalty kicks and how these strategies affect penalty outcomes. Key findings indicate that the speed of a shot influences the goalkeeper's reaction time and blocking success, and deceptive shooting strategies do not significantly affect the goalkeeper's movement direction, leading to the development of more comprehensive models of penalty success."
Electromyographic analysis of hip adductor muscles in soccer instep and side-foot kicking,2018-08-13,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Kohei Watanabe, Hiroyuki Nunome, Koichiro Inoue, Takahiro Iga, Hiroshi Akima","A possible link between soccer-specific injuries, such as groin pain and the action of hip adductor muscles has been suggested. This study aimed to investigate neuromuscular activation of the adductor magnus (AM) and longus (AL) muscles during instep and side-foot soccer kicks. Eight university soccer players performed the two types of kick at 50%, 75% and 100% of the maximal ball speed. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the AM, AL, vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles of both kicking and supporting legs and the kicking motions were three-dimensionally captured. In the kicking leg, an increase in surface EMG with an increase in ball speed during instep kicking was noted in the AM muscle (p < 0.016), but not in AL, VL or BF muscles (p > 0.016). In the supporting leg, surface EMG of both AM and AL muscles was significantly increased with an increase in the ball speed before ball impact during both instep and side-foot kicks (p < 0.016). These results suggest that hip adductor muscles markedly contribute to either the kicking or supporting leg to emphasise the action of soccer kicks.","This paper investigates the neuromuscular activation of the hip adductor muscles during soccer instep and side-foot kicking in relation to soccer-specific injuries. The findings indicate that the adductor magnus muscle shows significant activation in response to increased ball speed during instep kicks, while both adductor muscles are activated in the supporting leg during both kick types, highlighting their importance in the kicking action."
Scaling isometric mid-thigh pull maximum strength in division I Athletes: are we meeting the assumptions?,2018-08-13,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Timothy J. Suchomel, Sophia Nimphius, Michael H. Stone","This study examined the validity of various scaling methods, isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) peak force using various scaling methods, and the relationships between IMTP peak force and countermovement jump height. Fifty-one collegiate baseball and soccer athletes performed two maximal IMTPs. Absolute peak force was compared between teams and when data were scaled using ratio (RS), traditional allometric (ALLOTrad), and fitted allometric (ALLOFit) scaling. ALLOTrad and ALLOFit validity was violated because different derived exponents existed for baseball (b = 0.20) and soccer (b = 1.20). Soccer athletes produced greater RS peak force compared to baseball (p = 0.012), while no difference existed with absolute, ALLOTrad or ALLOFit (all p > 0.05) peak force. Moderate relationships existed between body mass and absolute (r = 0.402, p = 0.003) and RS (r = -0.328, p = 0.019) peak force, while trivial relationships existed with ALLOTrad and ALLOFit (both r < -0.10, p > 0.05). Trivial relationships existed between countermovement jump height and absolute, RS, ALLOTrad, and ALLOFit (all r < 0.20, p > 0.05) peak force. The current dataset violated allometric scaling assumptions, making it inappropriate to use ALLOTrad and ALLOFit scaling. Practitioners must understand the assumptions, limitations, and purpose of scaling methods.","This study investigates the validity of various scaling methods for measuring isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) peak force among Division I baseball and soccer athletes, revealing that traditional and fitted allometric scaling methods violate key assumptions.

The Effect of Angle and Velocity on Change of Direction Biomechanics: An Angle-Velocity Trade-Off,2018-08-09,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Thomas Dos’Santos, Christopher Thomas, Paul Comfort, Paul A. Jones","Changes of direction (CODs) are key manoeuvres linked to decisive moments in sport and are also key actions associated with lower limb injuries. During sport athletes perform a diverse range of CODs, from various approach velocities and angles, thus the ability to change direction safely and quickly is of great interest. To our knowledge, a comprehensive review examining the influence of angle and velocity on change of direction (COD) biomechanics does not exist. Findings of previous research indicate the biomechanical demands of CODs are 'angle' and 'velocity' dependent and are both critical factors that affect the technical execution of directional changes, deceleration and reacceleration requirements, knee joint loading, and lower limb muscle activity. Thus, these two factors regulate the progression and regression in COD intensity. Specifically, faster and sharper CODs elevate the relative risk of injury due to the greater associative knee joint loading; however, faster and sharper directional changes are key manoeuvres for successful performance in multidirectional sport, which subsequently creates a 'performance-injury conflict' for practitioners and athletes. This conflict, however, may be mediated by an athlete's physical capacity (i.e. ability to rapidly produce force and neuromuscular control). Furthermore, an 'angle-velocity trade-off' exists during CODs, whereby faster approaches compromise the execution of the intended COD; this is influenced by an athlete's physical capacity. Therefore, practitioners and researchers should acknowledge and understand the implications of angle and velocity on COD biomechanics when: (1) interpreting biomechanical research; (2) coaching COD technique; (3) designing and prescribing COD training and injury reduction programs; (4) conditioning athletes to tolerate the physical demands of directional changes; (5) screening COD technique; and (6) progressing and regressing COD intensity, specifically when working with novice or previously injured athletes rehabilitating from an injury.","This paper investigates the impact of angle and velocity on the biomechanics of change of direction (COD) in sports, highlighting their role in performance and injury risk. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these factors for coaching, training, and rehabilitating athletes, particularly in managing the 'performance-injury conflict' associated with COD execution."
Age-Dependent Patellofemoral Pain: Hip and Knee Risk Landing Profiles in Prepubescent and Postpubescent Female Athletes,2018-08-09,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Ryan T.

Myer, Alicia M. Montalvo","Background: Female athletes are at an increased risk of developing patellofemoral pain (PFP) relative to male athletes. The unique effects of maturation may compound that risk. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to evaluate the neuromuscular control mechanisms that are adaptive to pubertal maturation and determine their relative contribution to PFP development. It was hypothesized that aberrant landing mechanics (reduced sagittal-plane and increased frontal- and transverse-plane kinematics and kinetics) would be associated with an increased risk for PFP. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: There were 506 high school female athletes who completed a detailed medical history, the Anterior Knee Pain Scale, and a knee examination for the diagnosis of PFP and attended follow-up appointments. Athletes performed a drop vertical jump task instrumented with force plates, and biomechanical measures generated from standard 3-dimensional biomechanical analyses were used to classify participants into high- or low-risk knee and hip landing profiles for the development of PFP. The biomechanical measures used in the knee landing profile included sagittal-plane knee range of motion, peak knee abduction angle, peak knee abduction moment, and peak-to-peak transverse-plane knee moment. The biomechanical measures used in the hip landing profile included sagittal-plane hip range of motion, peak hip extensor moment, peak abductor moment, and peak hip rotator moment. Testing was conducted at sport-specific preseason appointments over the course of 2 years, and changes in pubertal status, landing profile, and PFP development were documented. Results: Female athletes with high-risk hip landing profiles experienced increased hip flexion and decreased abductor, rotator, and extensor moments. Participants with high-risk hip landing profiles who transitioned to postpubertal status at follow-up had higher odds (odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.1-4.0]; P = .02) of moving to a low-risk hip landing profile compared with those who had not reached postpubertal status at follow-up. Participants with high-risk knee landing profiles experienced decreased knee flexion and increased knee abduction, external abductor, and external rotator moments. Pubertal maturation was not associated with a change in the high-risk knee landing profile at follow-up. Conclusion: The progression from prepubertal to postpubertal status may have a protective effect on high-risk hip mechanics but no similar adaptations in high-risk knee mechanics during maturation. These data indicate that before puberty, maladaptive hip mechanics may contribute to PFP, while aberrant knee mechanics associated with PFP are sustained throughout the maturational process in young female athletes.","This paper investigates the relationship between maturation and patellofemoral pain (PFP) risk in female athletes, focusing on hip and knee landing mechanics across prepubescent and postpubescent stages. Findings suggest that maturation may reduce the risk associated with harmful hip mechanics, while maladaptive knee mechanics persist regardless of maturity, highlighting the distinct neuromuscular control challenges faced by young female athletes."

This cohort study was conducted over an observation period of 1 year, with measurements recorded at baseline, followed by screening for OSD every 6 months. Variables evaluated at baseline included physical function (morphometry, joint flexibility, and lower extremity alignment), presence of Sever disease, and kicking motion.Pathogenic factors associated with OSD in the support leg of adolescent male soccer players included height, weight, body mass index, quadriceps femoris muscle tightness in the kicking and support legs, and gastrocnemius muscle tightness, soleus muscle tightness, and medial longitudinal arch in the support leg. Additional factors included a diagnosis of Sever disease and distance from the lateral malleolus of the support leg's fibula to the center of gravity during kicking.The onset of OSD was found to be affected by many factors, including developmental stage, physical attributes, and pre-existing apophysitis. In particular, a diagnosis of Sever disease and backward shifting of the center of gravity during kicking increased the risk of the subsequent onset of OSD, suggesting that these factors are very important as a possible focus for interventions.","This study investigates the pathogenic factors linked to Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) in adolescent male soccer players through a one-year prospective cohort analysis. Key findings indicate that increased quadriceps muscle tightness, lower leg alignment issues, and concurrent diagnoses such as Sever disease are significant contributors to the development of OSD, highlighting the importance of these factors for potential preventive interventions."
The Effects of a Compression Garment on Lower Body Kinematics and Kinetics During a Drop Vertical Jump in Female Collegiate Athletes,2018-08-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Jacobo Zamporri, Arnel Aguinaldo","Background: The use of compression garments has spread rapidly among athletes, largely because of marketing and perceived benefits. Upon review, it is unclear whether compression garments have a significant effect on performance and recovery, although they have been found to enhance proprioception.

Methods: A sample of 23 healthy female collegiate athletes (mean age, 19.6 ± 1.3 years) participating in jumping sports (volleyball, basketball, and soccer) was included in this analysis. Each athlete performed 2 sets of 3 DVJs with and without a directional compression garment. Three-dimensional hip and knee kinematics and kinetics were collected using a standard Helen-Hayes 29-marker set, which was removed and reapplied after the garment was fitted, as well as 8 visible-red cameras and 2 force platforms. Each participant was tested in a single session. Results: Hip abduction range of motion was significantly reduced from 12.6° ± 5.5° to 10.2° ± 4.6° ( P = .002) while performing DVJs without and with the compression garment, respectively. No statistically significant differences between conditions were found in peak hip abduction, knee valgus range of motion, peak valgus, peak hip abduction moment, and peak knee valgus moment. Conclusion: The results of this study show that wearing compression garments does have minimal effects on lower body mechanics during landing from a DVJ, partially supporting the idea that compression garments could acutely alter movement patterns associated with the knee injury risk. However, further research should focus on muscle activation patterns and adaptations over time. Clinical Relevance: The use of specifically designed compression garments could aid in the prevention of knee injuries by inducing changes in jumping mechanics.","This study examines the impact of a directional compression garment on hip and knee kinematics and kinetics during drop vertical jumps in female collegiate athletes. The findings suggest that while compression garments significantly reduced hip abduction range of motion during jumps, they had minimal effects on other lower body mechanics, indicating potential for altering movement patterns associated with knee injury risk."
Stability in post-seasonal hematological profiles in response to high-competitive match-play loads within elite top-level European soccer players: implications from a pilot study,2018-08-01,Informa UK Limited,Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine,"Adam L Owen, Marco A Cossio-Bolaños, Gordon Dunlop, Mehdi Rouissi, Moktar Chtara, Nicola Luigi Bragazzi, Karim Chamari","Introduction: The stability of hematological status indices is a key determinant of optimal sport performance. The capacity to monitor hematological behaviors of elite soccer players may better explain the stresses placed upon physiological systems and the potential decrements in performance and physical capacity. The primary aim of this investigation was to examine the post-seasonal hematological status of professional top-level soccer players in response to seasonal match-play and training demands, in terms of the training practices, intensity, and loadings that they experience before, during, and after each season. Methods: Seventeen male elite European soccer players participated in the study (mean±SD: age 26.8±4.6 years, weight 78.1±5.7 kg, height 182.4±4.8 cm, body fat 9.8%±2.9%, and maximal aerobic capacity 56.5±4.2 mL kg −1 min −1 ). The season culminated in 74 competitive matches including domestic, Champions League, and UEFA Cup matches. Blood samples were collected between 9:00 and 10:30 am after an overnight fast (~10 hours), 72 hours post conclusion of the final match of the competitive season. Results: Near-perfect correlations between white blood cells, neutrophils, the period of season, training availability, and total competitive minutes were found. When adjusting for all the confounding variables, a stability of the hematological profile was noticed. Only mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin values were associated with the requirement for elite European soccer teams to fulfill excessive competitive loadings. The reported lower mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin values may highlight the accumulative effects of seasonal training and match-play demands. Conclusion: Regular blood testing could identify the need for both squad rotation and the implementation of interventions to assist in stabilizing transient hematological behaviors in order to optimize performance and sports output. Keywords: soccer, hematology, biochemistry, training availability, match-play demands","This paper investigates the stability of hematological profiles in elite European soccer players in response to the demands of high-competitive match-play and training throughout the season. The findings suggest a correlation between various hematological indices and performance metrics, indicating that regular blood testing could be beneficial for monitoring player health and optimizing performance strategies in relation to training and match demands."

Pincheira, Rony Silvestre, Susan Armijo-Olivo, Rodrigo Guzman-Venegas","The aim of this study was to compare muscle activation onset times of knee muscles between the involved and uninvolved knee of patients with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and the uninjured knees of healthy subjects after a controlled perturbation at the ankle level.Fifty male amateur soccer players, 25 with unilateral ACLR using semitendinosus-gracilis graft (age = 28.36 ± 7.87 years; time after surgery = 9 ± 3 months) and 25 uninjured control subjects (age = 24.16 ± 2.67 years) participated in the study. Two destabilizing platforms (one for each limb) generated a controlled perturbation at the ankle of each participant (30°of inversion, 10°plantarflexion simultaneously) in a weight bearing condition. The muscle activation onset times of semitendinosus (ST) and vastus medialis (VM) was detected through an electromyographic (EMG) analysis to assess the neuromuscular function of knee muscles.Subjects with ACLR had significant delays in EMG onset in the involved (VM = 99.9 ± 30 ms; ST = 101.7 ± 28 ms) and uninvolved knee (VM = 100.4 ± 26 ms; ST = 104.7 ± 28 ms) when compared with the healthy subjects (VM = 69.1 ± 9 ms; ST = 74.6 ± 9 ms). However, no difference was found between involved and uninvolved knee of the ACLR group.The results show a bilateral alteration of knee muscles in EMG onset after a unilateral ACLR, responses that can be elicited with an ankle perturbation. This suggests an alteration in the central processing of proprioceptive information and/or central nervous system re-organization that may affect neuromuscular control of knee muscles in the involved and uninvolved lower limbs.","This study investigates the muscle activation onset times of knee muscles in male amateur soccer players who have undergone unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), compared to healthy controls.

The sample of the study was 40 soccer players (n=20 control and n=20 experimental) aged 10-12 years (age=11.2±08). Besides daily training program, soccer players in the experimental group participated in an extra 8-week fitness program which included bosu &amp; swiss ball workouts, balance board workouts, plyometric workouts and bodyweight core stability workouts. Soccer players in the control group only continued their daily routine training. The static and dynamic balance performances of the players in the experimental and control groups were measured using Flamingo Balance Test (FBT) and Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) before and after the 8-week fitness program. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant differences between pre and post test results regarding both static and dynamic balance performance of the players in the experimental group (p&lt;0.05). Based on the findings, it was concluded that the 8-week fitness program which included bosu &amp; swiss ball workouts, balance board workouts, plyometric workouts and bodyweight core stability workouts contributed to the static and dynamic balance development in 10-12-year-old soccer players.","This paper investigates the impact of an 8-week balance and stability training program on the static and dynamic balance of 10-12-year-old soccer players.

METHODS Twenty-three professional female soccer players participated in this study. Thigh muscle activation patterns, knee joint kinematics, and kinetics were analyzed during drop landing from 30cm and 50cm. Statistical analysis was carried out with a paired t-test to compare the risk factors of anterior cruciate ligament damage in the population with increasing box height. RESULTS The activation of anterior part of thigh was significantly increased in drop landing from 50cm compared with 30cm, but no significant posterior part. As the box height increased, protective mechanisms of ACL injury were observed increasing ACL injury risk in drop landing. CONCLUSIONS The hamstring training to maintain stability of the knee joint and limit anterior translation of the tibia may diminish risk of the anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Mid-flight lateral trunk bending increased ipsilateral leg loading during landing: a center of mass analysis,2018-07-30,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Taylour J. Hinshaw, Daniel J. Davis, Jacob S. Layer, Margaret A. Wilson, Qin Zhu, Boyi Dai","Increased lateral trunk bending to the injured side has been observed when ACL injuries occur. The purpose was to quantify the effect of mid-flight lateral trunk bending on center of mass (COM) positions and subsequent landing mechanics during a jump-landing task. Forty-one recreational athletes performed a jump-landing task with or without mid-flight lateral trunk bending. When the left and right trunk bending conditions were compared with the no trunk bending condition, participants moved the COM of the upper body to the bending direction, while the COM of the pelvis, ipsilateral leg, and contralateral leg moved away from the bending direction relative to the whole body COM. Participants demonstrated increased peak vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) and knee valgus and internal rotation angles at peak VGRF for the ipsilateral leg, but decreased peak VGRF and knee internal rotation angles at peak VGRF and increased knee varus angles at peak VGRF for the contralateral leg. Mid-flight lateral trunk resulted in an asymmetric landing pattern associated with increased ACL loading for the ipsilateral leg. The findings may help to understand altered trunk motion during ACL injury events and the discrepancy in ACL injuries related to limb dominance in badminton and volleyball.","The paper investigates the impact of mid-flight lateral trunk bending on center of mass positions and landing mechanics during jump-landing tasks, particularly in relation to ACL injuries. It identifies that increased lateral trunk bending leads to asymmetric landing patterns, resulting in heightened loading on the ipsilateral leg and contributing to an understanding of trunk motion alterations during ACL injury events."
Anticipating the Direction of Soccer Penalty Shots Depends on the Speed and Technique of the Kick,2018-07-29,MDPI AG,Sports,"Andrew H. Hunter, Sean C. Murphy, Michael J. Angilletta, Robbie S. Wilson","To succeed at a sport, athletes must manage the biomechanical trade-offs that constrain their performance. Here, we investigate a previously unknown trade-off in soccer: how the speed of a kick makes the outcome more predictable to an opponent. For this analysis, we focused on penalty kicks to build on previous models of factors that influence scoring. More than 700 participants completed an online survey, watching videos of penalty shots from the perspective of a goalkeeper. Participants (ranging in soccer playing experience from never played to professional) watched 60 penalty kicks, each of which was occluded at a particular moment (−0.4 s to 0.0 s) before the kicker contacted the ball. For each kick, participants had to predict shot direction toward the goal (left or right). As expected, predictions became more accurate as time of occlusion approached ball contact. However, the effect of occlusion was more pronounced when players kicked with the side of the foot than when they kicked with the top of the foot (instep). For side-foot kicks, the direction of shots was predicted more accurately for faster kicks, especially when a large portion of the kicker’s approach was presented. Given the trade-off between kicking speed and directional predictability, a penalty kicker might benefit from kicking below their maximal speed.","This paper investigates the impact of kick speed and technique on opponents' ability to predict penalty shot direction in soccer. The findings suggest that faster side-foot kicks lead to greater directional predictability, highlighting a trade-off that may benefit kickers by not always maximizing speed to enhance scoring outcomes."

Development of a Footwear Sizing System in the National Football League,2018-07-26,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"John W. Wannop, Darren J. Stefanyshyn, Robert B. Anderson, Michael J. Coughlin, Richard Kent","Context: Footwear performance and injury mitigation may be compromised if the footwear is not properly sized for an athlete. Additionally, poor fit may result in discomfort and foot injury such as fifth metatarsal stress fracture, foot deformities, turf toe, and blisters. Current footwear fitting methods consist of foot length and width measurements, which may not properly describe the shape of the individual foot, correlated with shoe size descriptors that are not standardized. Footwear manufacturers employ a range of sizing rubrics, which introduces shoe size and shape variability between and even within footwear companies. This article describes the synthesis of literature to inform the development and deployment of an objective footwear fitting system in the National Football League (NFL). The process may inform athletic footwear fitting at other levels of play and in other sports. Evidence Acquisition: Literature related to footwear fitting, sizing, and foot scanning from 1980 through 2017 was compiled using electronic databases. Reference lists of articles were examined for additional relevant studies. Sixty-five sources are included in this descriptive review. Study Type: Descriptive review. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Results: Current methods of footwear fitting and variability in the size and shape of athletic footwear complicate proper fitting of footwear to athletes. An objective measurement and recommendation system that can match the 3-dimensional shape of an athlete’s foot to the internal shape of available shoe models can provide important guidance for footwear selection. One such system has been deployed in the NFL.

Pfeifer, Rebecca Woehl, Jürgen Eichhorn, Johannes Zellner, Michael Nerlich, Peter Angele","The historical treatment options for partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures were conservative therapy or ACL reconstruction by injured bundle or entire ACL replacement. In awareness of the regenerative potential of biologic agents such as mesenchymal stem cells or platelet rich plasma (PRP), the healing response technique was developed to preserve the injured ACL with better outcomes than the conservative therapy. Further improvement of this technique seems to be obtained by the additional application of PRP products. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the midterm outcome after intraligament autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) by a clinical, scoring, and functional performance assessment. 42 patients were evaluated in this study. The failure rate was 9.5%. Outcome evaluation showed good to excellent results. The scores were IKDC subjective 83.2 (SD 14.5), Lysholm 85.5 (SD 15.5), Tegner 4.7 (SD 1.7), and Cincinnati 85.4 (SD 15.5) after a mean follow-up of 33 months. Clinical examination showed stable Lachman test, negative pivot shift phenomenon, and a significant reduction in AP-laxity compared to preoperative status (rolimeter preoperative: 1.9 (SD1.4); postoperative 0.6 (SD1.8), p=0.001) in all patients.

Regular companions of sports activities are sport injuries of various parts of the body, depending on the type and conditions in which sport activity is performed. In this paper, we analyzed knee injuries because they are the most dominant. The knee, which is the largest, the most complex and the most stressed joint, is most exposed to injuries. We analyzed 124 respondents who were treated in the Ribarska Banja, by physical and balneological treatment, during the period 2005-2006. Anamnestic data, as the most common cause of injury, include insufficient training, insufficient physical preparedness, rough start of an opponent or uneven terrain. The knee joint is the most commonly injured region in athletes, and because of the complexity of the joint itself, these injuries are very complicated. Balneal treatment showed positive effects on healing and accelerated return to the field. Balneo Climatic Treatment is always accompanied with certain methods of physical therapy and rehabilitation, and all of them together can accelerate healing. The successful return to the field depends on the applied therapeutic methods and on an early beginning of therapeutic treatment.","This paper analyzes the prevalence and treatment of knee injuries in athletes, highlighting the complexity of the knee joint and the common causes of such injuries, including insufficient training and poor playing conditions.

Validation of electronic performance and tracking systems EPTS under field conditions,2018-07-23,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Daniel Linke, Daniel Link, Martin Lames","The purpose of this study was to assess the measurement accuracy of the most commonly used tracking technologies in professional team sports (i.e., semi-automatic multiple-camera video technology (VID), radar-based local positioning system (LPS), and global positioning system (GPS)). The position, speed, acceleration and distance measures of each technology were compared against simultaneously recorded measures of a reference system (VICON motion capture system) and quantified by means of the root mean square error RMSE. Fourteen male soccer players (age: 17.4±0.4 years, height: 178.6±4.2 cm, body mass: 70.2±6.2 kg) playing for the U19 Bundesliga team FC Augsburg participated in the study. The test battery comprised a sport-specific course, shuttle runs, and small sided games on an outdoor soccer field. The validity of fundamental spatiotemporal tracking data differed significantly between all tested technologies. In particular, LPS showed higher validity for measuring an athlete’s position (23±7 cm) than both VID (56±16 cm) and GPS (96±49 cm). Considering errors of instantaneous speed measures, GPS (0.28±0.07 m⋅s-1) and LPS (0.25±0.06 m⋅s-1) achieved significantly lower error values than VID (0.41±0.08 m⋅s-1). Equivalent accuracy differences were found for instant acceleration values (GPS: 0.67±0.21 m⋅s-2, LPS: 0.68±0.14 m⋅s-2, VID: 0.91±0.19 m⋅s-2). During small-sided games, lowest deviations from reference measures have been found in the total distance category, with errors ranging from 2.2% (GPS) to 2.7% (VID) and 4.0% (LPS). All technologies had in common that the magnitude of the error increased as the speed of the tracking object increased. Especially in performance indicators that might have a high impact on practical decisions, such as distance covered with high speed, we found >40% deviations from the reference system for each of the technologies. Overall, our results revealed significant between-system differences in the validity of tracking data, implying that any comparison of results using different tracking technologies should be done with caution.","This study evaluates the measurement accuracy of various electronic performance and tracking systems (EPTS) commonly used in professional football, including semi-automatic video technology, radar-based local positioning systems, and GPS.

Inertial Sensors are a Valid Tool to Detect and Consistently Quantify Jumping,2018-07-19,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Rhys Spangler, Timo Rantalainen, Paul Gastin, Daniel Wundersitz","Abstract Considering the large and repetitive loads associated with jumping in team sports, automatic detection and quantification of jumping may show promise in reducing injury risks. The aim of this study was to validate commercially available inertial-movement analysis software to detect and quantify jumping in team sports. In addition, the test-retest reliability of the software to quantify jumping was assessed. Seventy-six healthy male participants completed a team sport circuit six times containing seven common movements (including three countermovement and two single-leg jumps) whilst wearing an inertial sensor (Catapult Sports, Australia). Jump detection accuracy was assessed by comparing the known number of jumps to the number recorded by the inertial movement analysis software. A further 27 participants separately performed countermovement and single-leg jumps at 33%, 66% and 100% of maximal jump height over two sessions. Jump height quantification accuracy was assessed by comparing criterion three-dimensional motion analysis-derived heights to that recorded by the inertial movement analysis software. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing recorded jump heights between both testing sessions. Catapult’s inertial movement analysis software displayed excellent jump detection accuracy (96.9%) and test-retest jump height quantification reliability (ICC: 0.86 [countermovement jump], 0.88 [single-leg jump]). However, significant mean bias (–2.74 cm [95% LoA –10.44 – 4.96]) was observed for jump height quantification. Overall, Catapult’s inertial movement analysis software appears to be a suitable method of automatically detecting jumping in team sports, and although reliable, caution is advised when using the IMA software to quantify jump height.","This paper validates the use of inertial sensors and movement analysis software for the automatic detection and quantification of jumping in team sports, highlighting its potential for reducing injury risks.

Prior Knowledge of the Grading Criteria Increases Functional Movement Screen Scores in Youth Soccer Players,2018-07-19,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research,"Anthony Bryson, Rosemary Arthur, Chris Easton","Abstract Bryson, A, Arthur, R, and Easton, C. Prior knowledge of the grading criteria increases Functional Movement Screen scores in youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(3): 762–768, 2021—We sought to determine whether familiarity with the grading criteria of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) impacted the outcome score in elite youth soccer players. Thirty-two trained male youth soccer players (aged 17 ± 1 years) participated in a randomized control trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to evenly sized control and experimental groups, who each completed the FMS on 2 separate occasions. Subjects in the experimental group were provided the FMS grading criteria between their first and second screens. Time-synchronized video footage was used to grade the FMS using standardized criteria. Structured interviews were then conducted with selected subjects ( n = 4) in the experimental group to establish athletes' perception of the FMS. The experimental group had a large increase in overall FMS score from the first to the second screen in comparison with the control group (Δ2.0 ± 1.0, p &lt; 0.001, d = 1.3). Scores for the deep squat, hurdle step, and rotary stability tests components of the FMS all increased in the experimental group in comparison with the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). Thematic analysis of the interview data suggested that the subjects in the experimental group improved their understanding between good and poor technique during the FMS. These findings support the notion that FMS scores are influenced by awareness of the grading criteria. As a consequence, the FMS may not be suitable for objectively predicting injury in youth soccer players.","The paper investigates the impact of prior knowledge of grading criteria on the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores of elite youth soccer players. It finds that familiarity with grading criteria significantly improves performance scores in the FMS tests, indicating that awareness may influence the measurement of movement quality and questioning the FMS's reliability in injury prediction."
Gait Mechanics After ACL Reconstruction Differ According to Medial Meniscal Treatment,2018-07-18,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery,"Jacob J. Capin, Ashutosh Khandha, Ryan Zarzycki, Kurt Manal, Thomas S. Buchanan, Lynn Snyder-Mackler","Knee osteoarthritis risk is high after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and arthroscopic meniscal surgery, and higher among individuals who undergo both. Although osteoarthritis development is multifactorial, altered walking mechanics may influence osteoarthritis progression. The purpose of this study was to compare gait mechanics after ACLR among participants who had undergone no medial meniscal surgery, partial medial meniscectomy, or medial meniscal repair.This was a secondary analysis of data collected prospectively as part of a clinical trial. Sixty-one athletes (mean age of 21.4 ± 8.2 years) who had undergone primary ACLR participated in the study when they achieved impairment resolution (5.3 ± 1.7 months postoperatively), including minimal to no effusion, full knee range of motion, and ≥80% quadriceps-strength symmetry. Participants were classified by concomitant medial meniscal treatment: no involvement or nonsurgical management of a small, stable tear; partial meniscectomy; or meniscal repair. Participants underwent comprehensive walking analyses. Joint contact forces were estimated using a previously validated, electromyography-driven musculoskeletal model. Variables were analyzed using a mixed-model analysis of variance with group and limb comparisons (α = 0.05); group comparisons of interlimb differences in measurements (surgical minus contralateral limb) were performed to determine significant interactions.The participants in the partial meniscectomy group walked with a higher peak knee adduction moment (pKAM) in the surgical versus the contralateral limb as compared with those in the meniscal repair group and those with no medial meniscal surgery (group difference for partial versus repair: 0.10 N-m/kg-m, p = 0.020; and for partial versus none: 0.06 N-m/kg-m, p = 0.037). Participants in the repair group walked with a smaller percentage of medial to total tibiofemoral loading in the surgical limb compared with both of the other groups (group difference for repair versus partial: -12%, p = 0.001; and for repair versus none: -7%, p = 0.011). The participants in the repair group loaded the medial compartment of the surgical versus the contralateral limb 0.5 times body weight less than did the participants in the partial meniscectomy group.Participants in the partial meniscectomy group walked with higher pKAM and shifted loading toward the medial compartment of the surgical limb, while participants in the repair group did the opposite, walking with lower pKAM and unloading the surgical limb relative to the contralateral limb. These findings may partially explain the conflicting evidence regarding pKAM after ACLR and the elevated risk for osteoarthritis (whether from overloading or underloading) after ACLR with concomitant medial meniscectomy or repair.Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.","This study investigates the effects of medial meniscal treatment on gait mechanics in athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It finds that participants who underwent partial meniscectomy exhibited higher peak knee adduction moments and shifted loading towards the medial compartment of the surgical limb, while those who had meniscal repair showed the opposite pattern, contributing to an understanding of how surgical methods impact post-operative walking mechanics and the risk of osteoarthritis."
Closing the Wearable Gap: Mobile Systems for Kinematic Signal Monitoring of the Foot and Ankle,2018-07-18,MDPI AG,Electronics,"Tony Luczak, David Saucier, Reuben F. Burch V., John E. Ball, Harish Chander, Adam Knight, Pan Wei, Tashfin Iftekhar","Interviews from strength and conditioning coaches across all levels of athletic competition identified their two biggest concerns with the current state of wearable technology: (a) the lack of solutions that accurately capture data “from the ground up” and (b) the lack of trust due to inconsistent measurements. The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of liquid metal sensors, specifically Liquid Wire sensors, as a potential solution for accurately capturing ankle complex movements such as plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion. Sensor stretch linearity was validated using a Micro-Ohm Meter and a Wheatstone bridge circuit. Sensors made from different substrates were also tested and discovered to be linear at multiple temperatures. An ankle complex model and computing unit for measuring resistance values were developed to determine sensor output based on simulated plantar flexion movement. The sensors were found to have a significant relationship between the positional change and the resistance values for plantar flexion movement. The results of the study ultimately confirm the researchers’ hypothesis that liquid metal sensors, and Liquid Wire sensors specifically, can serve as a mitigating substitute for inertial measurement unit (IMU) based solutions that attempt to capture specific joint angles and movements.","This paper investigates the use of Liquid Wire sensors for accurately monitoring ankle complex movements, addressing concerns from strength and conditioning coaches regarding wearable technology's reliability. The findings support the hypothesis that these liquid metal sensors can effectively replace traditional inertial measurement units in capturing joint angles and movements related to plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion."
Effects of Different Plyometric Training Frequencies on Components of Physical Fitness in Amateur Female Soccer Players,2018-07-17,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Rodrigo Ramirez-Campillo, Felipe García-Pinillos, Amador García-Ramos, Javier Yanci, Paulo Gentil, Helmi Chaabene, Urs Granacher","Plyometric jump training (PJT) is a frequently used and effective means to improve amateur and elite soccer players' physical fitness. However, it is unresolved how different PJT frequencies per week with equal overall training volume may affect training-induced adaptations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of an in-season 8 week PJT with one session versus two sessions per week and equal training volume on components of physical fitness in amateur female soccer players. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants (N=23; age, 21.4±3.2 years) were randomly assigned to a one session PJT per-week (PJT-1, n=8), two sessions PJT per-week (PJT-2, n=8) or an active control group (CON, n=7). Before and after training, participants performed countermovement jumps (CMJ), drop-jumps from a 20-cm drop-height (DJ20), a maximal kicking velocity test (MKV), the 15-m linear sprint-time test, the Meylan test for the assessment of change of direction ability (CoDA), and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery endurance test (Yo-YoIR1). Results revealed significant main effects of time for the CMJ, DJ20, MKV, 15-m sprint, CoDA, and the Yo-YoIR1 (all p0.05; ∆0.5-4.2%, d=0.03-0.2). In conclusion, higher PJT exposure in terms of session frequency has no extra effects on female soccer players' physical fitness development when jump volume is equated during a short-term (i.e., 8 weeks) training program. From this, it follows that one PJT session per week combined with regular soccer-specific training appears to be sufficient to induce physical fitness improvements in amateur female soccer players.","This paper investigates the impact of different frequencies of plyometric jump training (PJT) on physical fitness components in amateur female soccer players. The study concludes that one session per week of PJT, when combined with regular soccer training, is sufficient to promote physical fitness improvements, as increasing the frequency to two sessions does not yield additional benefits in physical fitness adaptations."
Could recreational soccer players recover single-leg heel raise performance 12-weeks after Achilles tenorrhaphy through immediate rehabilitation?,2018-07-17,SAGE Publications,Physiotherapy Practice and Research: The Official Journal of The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists,"Carlos De la Fuente, Claudio Chamorro, Rodrigo Ramírez-Campillo, Juan Pablo Araya, Gustavo Torres, Aquiles Yañez","BACKGROUND:Immediate rehabilitation is increasingly used for tendon injuries, but complete single-leg heel raise recovery after injury remains uncommon. PURPOSE:This study primarily determined if immediate versus traditional rehabilitation resulted in better single-leg heel raise recovery against t he physiological reference, and compared performance recovery against the non-injured limb. The study also explored if clinical parameters at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-tenorrhaphy are predictors of more single-leg heel raises at week 12 in recreational soccer players. METHOD:Twenty-six amateur soccer players (43.2±10.1 years-old, BMI 29.5±3.9 kg/m2) underwent rehabilitation using early or traditional rehabilitation following Dresden tenorrhaphy of the Achilles tendon. The main outcome was the single-leg heel raise repetitions. RESULTS:Immediate rehabilitation resulted in significantly more single-leg heel raises than traditional rehabilitation (p < 0.001). Performance capacity compared to the physiological reference was significantly greater for immediate rehabilitation (p < 0.001) but significantly lower for traditional rehabilitation (p < 0.001). Only immediate rehabilitation recovered single-leg heel raise capacity as compared to the non-injured limb (p = 0.217). The beta coefficients for weight and dorsiflexion range of motion at week 12 were respectively – 0.81±0.25 and 1.86±0.61. CONCLUSIONSImmediate AT tenorrhaphy rehabilitation more quickly recovers reference values and approximates non-injured-limb values for single-leg heel raise capacity after a 12-week physical therapy program. Dorsiflexion range of motion at week 12 and weight were predictors for more single-leg heel raise repetitions at week 12.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of immediate rehabilitation compared to traditional rehabilitation in restoring single-leg heel raise performance in recreational soccer players following Achilles tenorrhaphy. Key findings indicate that immediate rehabilitation significantly enhances recovery outcomes and is better at aligning performance with non-injured limb values, with specific clinical parameters showing predictive ability for recovery success."
Mechanisms of acute adductor longus injuries in male football players: a systematic visual video analysis,2018-07-13,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Andreas Serner, Andrea Britt Mosler, Johannes L Tol, Roald Bahr, Adam Weir","Change of direction and kicking have been described as the main actions resulting in adductor longus injury. Video descriptions of inciting events are lacking.Perform a standardised visual video analysis of a series of acute adductor longus injuries in football.Cross-sectional.Video footage was reviewed by players, and assessed independently by five sports medicine professionals. Inciting events were described and categorised using standardised scoring, including playing situation, player/opponent behaviour, movement and body positions.Videos of acute adductor longus injuries in 17 professional male football players were analysed. Most injuries occurred in non-contact situations (71%), following a quick reaction to a change in play (53%). Injury actions were: change of direction (35%), kicking (29%), reaching (24%) and jumping (12%). Change of direction and reaching injuries were categorised as closed chain movements (59%), characterised by hip extension and abduction with external rotation. Kicking and jumping injuries were categorised as open chain (41%), characterised by a change from hip extension to hip flexion, and hip abduction to adduction, with external rotation.Acute adductor longus injuries in football occur in a variety of situations. Player actions can be categorised into closed (change of direction and reaching) and open (kicking and jumping) chain movements involving triplanar hip motion. A rapid muscle activation during a rapid muscle lengthening appears to be the fundamental injury mechanism for acute adductor longus injuries.","This paper conducts a systematic visual analysis of acute adductor longus injuries in male football players, identifying key actions such as change of direction and kicking as significant contributors. The study categorizes these injuries into closed and open chain movements, highlighting triplanar hip motion and rapid muscle activation as critical mechanisms behind these injuries."
A novel Cervical Spine Protection device for reducing neck injuries in contact sports: design concepts and preliminary <i>in vivo</i> testing,2018-07-13,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Paolo Caravaggi, Alberto Leardini, Claudio Belvedere, Sorin Siegler","Head and neck injuries are common in contact sports such as American football. Different mechanisms can produce such injuries, including compressive impact forces on the crown of the helmet with the neck in a flexed chin-down position. The aim of this paper was developing and testing a novel Cervical Spine Protection Device (CSPD) designed to keep the neck within its safe physiological range. The cervical spine range of motion (ROM) of ten participants was measured under four conditions: free; wearing a football gear; wearing the CSPD; and wearing the CSPD underneath the gear. The CSPD was tested in terms of passive and active restraint of head motion, and for its capability to improve endurance time of the neck extensor muscles. Wearing the CSPD resulted in a significant 40–60% reduction in ROM across the three anatomical planes, and in increased endurance of the neck extensor muscles (FREE: 114 ± 57 s; CSPD: 214 ± 95 s; p = 0.004). In quasi-static loading conditions the CSPD was capable of keeping the neck within its physiological range, thus it may be used to decrease the risk of severe injuries due to dangerous chin-down positions.","The paper focuses on the design and preliminary testing of a novel Cervical Spine Protection Device (CSPD) aimed at reducing neck injuries in contact sports like football. Key findings show that wearing the CSPD significantly reduced cervical spine range of motion and improved neck extensor muscle endurance, indicating its potential to decrease injury risk associated with harmful head and neck positions."

"Association between knee-to-hip flexion ratio during single-leg vertical landings, and strength and range of motion in professional soccer players",2018-07-12,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Gustavo Leporace, Marcio Tannure, Gabriel Zeitoune, Leonardo Metsavaht, Moacir Marocolo, Alex Souto Maior","The aim of this study was to test the correlation between knee-to-hip flexion ratio during a single leg landing task and hip and knee strength, and ankle range of motion. Twenty-four male participants from a professional soccer team performed a continuous single leg jump-landing test during 10s, while lower limb kinematics data were collected using a motion analysis system. After biomechanical testing, maximal isometric hip (abduction, extension, external rotation), knee extension and flexion strength were measured. Maximum ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was assessed statically using the weight bearing lunge test. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the associations between the predictor variables (knee and hip strength, and ankle ROM) and the main outcome measure (knee-to-hip flexion ratio). Correlation between knee-to-hip flexion ratio and hip abductors strength was significant (r = −0.47; p = 0.019). No other significant correlations were observed among the variables (p > 0.05). These results demonstrated that a lower hip abductors strength in male soccer players was correlated with a high knee-to-hip flexion ratio during landing from a single leg jump, potentially increasing knee overload by decreasing energy absorption at the hip. The results provide a novel proposal for the functioning of hip muscles to control knee overload.","The paper investigates the relationship between the knee-to-hip flexion ratio during single-leg vertical landings and the strength and range of motion in professional soccer players. It finds a significant correlation between lower hip abductor strength and a higher knee-to-hip flexion ratio, suggesting that decreased hip strength may lead to increased knee overload during landing."

Effects of football simulated fatigue on neuromuscular function and whole‐body response to disturbances in balance,2018-07-07,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Fearghal P. Behan, Scott Willis, Matt T.G. Pain, Jonathan P. Folland","The effect of football‐specific fatigue on explosive neuromuscular performance and dynamic balance has received little attention in the literature despite the potential consequences for injury risk. This study aimed to investigate the effect of fatigue induced by simulated football match play on maximal and explosive knee flexor ( KF ) and knee extensor ( KE ) torque, and thus the maximal and explosive KF / KE ratio, as well as the effect of fatigue induced by simulated football match play on whole‐body response to disturbances in balance. Fifteen male team sports players (mean ± SD : age 24.2 ± 4.2 years; stature 1.79 ± 0.09 m; body mass, 77.3 ± 10.7 kg) underwent ~90 minutes of the modified Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test ( LIST ; fatiguing exercise condition) or seated rest (control condition) on separate days. Maximal and explosive isometric KF and KE voluntary torque ( MVT / EVT ) were assessed pre‐ and post‐condition. Maximal and explosive KF / KE ratios were calculated. Center of mass ( COM ) response (displacement) to unexpected anterior and posterior platform perturbations were also assessed pre‐ and post‐condition. Football simulated fatigue resulted in reduced KF (15%) and KE (12%) MVT ( P ≤ 0.002) but was not found to reduce EVT of either muscle group, or explosive KF / KE ratio. Football simulated fatigue resulted in impaired balance response (11% increase in COM displacement) to unexpected perturbation in the posterior ( P = 0.002) but not the anterior direction. Impaired response to dynamic disturbances in balance, rather than explosive torque or changes in muscle balance (H/Q ratios), may be a contributory factor toward increased injury risk in the latter portion of football games, and likely highlights the influence of fatigue on sensory/proprioceptive processes.","This paper investigates the impact of simulated football match fatigue on neuromuscular function and dynamic balance in male team sports players. Key findings indicate that fatigue significantly reduces maximal isometric knee flexor and extensor torque and impairs balance response to unexpected perturbations, which may contribute to increased injury risk during the latter stages of football games."

We hypothesized that there would be a high relative incidence of ankle injuries in these players compared with other sports and that there would be a direct correlation between the incidence of ankle injuries and player position.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.A retrospective chart review of data collected from NFL Combine participants between 2009 and 2015 was performed. Patient demographics, history, physical examination results, and imaging findings were reviewed.Of 2285 players, 1216 (53.2%) had a history of ankle injuries; of these, 987 (81.2%) had unilateral injuries, while 229 (18.8%) had bilateral injuries (total of 1445 ankles injured). This included 1242 ankle sprains (86.0% of ankle injuries): 417 (33.6% of sprains) high and 930 (74.9%) low.

The correlations between isokinetic knee strength, jumping performance, and postural control were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. A linear regression model was used to evaluate the effect of hamstrings and quadriceps peak torque of both legs at 60º·s-1, total work of both legs at 240º·s-1, and postural priority on jumping performance.The peak torque of right leg knee flexor (quadriceps) muscles, evaluated at 60º·s-1 speed, showed correlations with counter movement jump, 30 second jumping and squat jump (P=0.005, P=0.003, and P=0.007, respectively). We also observed a strong relationship between counter movement jump and 30 second jumping and peak torque of left leg evaluated at the same speed of 60º·s-1 (P=0.26 and P=0.22, respectively). No significant correlations were found between any of the jumping tests and peak torque of knee extensors of both legs at 60º·s-1. For the 30 second jumping test, it appears that jumping endurance has a significant relationship with total work of knee flexors for right and left legs at 240º·s-1.The results of this study demonstrate practical implications for soccer performance, but further exploration is required.","This study investigates the relationship between vertical jumping performance, isokinetic strength of the knee extensors and flexors, and dynamic postural control in elite youth soccer players.

A prospective study of functional outcome of ACL reconstruction with quadrupled semitendinosus tendon autograft using Endobutton and bioabsorbable interference screw,2018-07-01,AkiNik Publications,International Journal of Orthopaedics Sciences,"Dr. Anil Kumar Mishra, Dr. Girish S","Background: The Anterior Cruciate ligament (ACL) is the primary stabilizer of the knee and prevents the knee against anterior translation. It is also important in counteracting rotational and valgus stress. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction is an established and widely practiced surgical procedure with proven efficacy and a low morbidity profile. The arthroscopically aided approach has the advantages of smaller skin and capsular incisions, improved viewing of the intercondylar notch for placement of the tunnel and attachment sites, less postoperative pain, fewer adhesions, earlier motion, and easier rehabilitation. The advantages with semitendinosus grafts are availability of a greater sectional area and unaffected integrity of the extensor mechanism. Moreover tensile strength of quadrupled hamstring is found to be even better than a normal ACL. The rate of complications like extension loss, anterior knee pain and surgical site infections was also lower than other procedures like in BPTB grafts. Cortical suspension devices have the necessary biomechanical properties with regard to ultimate failure strength, displacement, and stiffness for initial fixation of soft tissue in the femoral tunnel for ACL reconstruction. The aperture fixation methods like the interference screws allows for early firm fixation and heal with tight bone-tendon interface. Objectives: To evaluate functional outcome of arthroscopy assisted ACL reconstruction with quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft using Endobutton and Bioabsorbable interference screw.Methodology: The study results included 120 patients (serving soldiers) admitted with clinical and radiological deficiency of ACL during march 2015 to march 2018, in Department of Orthopaedics, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune. Study aims to assess the functional outcome of arthroscopy assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft using Endobutton and Bioabsorbable interference screw in terms of range of motion, postoperative knee stability, graft site morbidity, subjective knee functions and prospective assessment of functional outcome using Tegner Lysholm knee scoring system. Results: All the patients included in the study were serving male soldiers.

High-Speed Video Analysis of Syndesmosis Injuries in Soccer—Can It Predict Injury Mechanism and Return to Play? A Pilot Study,2018-07-01,SAGE Publications,Foot &amp; Ankle Orthopaedics,"Neil Jain, David Murray, Steve Kemp, James Calder","Background: Ankle syndesmosis injuries in professional soccer may lead to an unpredictable and prolonged recovery. This injury has been investigated in anatomical and radiologic studies but the precise mechanism leading to syndesmosis injury is not well understood and remains debated. The 2 goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the relationship between the mechanism of syndesmosis injury as determined by high-speed video analysis and the injured structures identified by clinical and radiologic examination and to (2) investigate the relationship between mechanism of injury and time of return to play. Methods: This pilot study prospectively reviewed high-speed video analysis of 12 professional soccer players who sustained syndesmosis injuries. The mechanism of injury was compared with the clinical and MRI evaluation and the time taken to return to play. Results: Higher-grade syndesmosis injuries occurred during ankle external rotation with dorsiflexion. Supination-inversion injuries with a standard lateral ankle sprain (rupture of the anterior talofibular ligament) may extend proximally, causing a lower-grade syndesmosis injury. These may present with signs of a high ankle sprain but have a quicker return to sport than those following a dorsiflexion-external rotation injury (mean 26 days vs 91 days). Conclusions: Video analysis confirmed that at least 2 mechanisms may result in injury to the ankle syndesmosis. Those “simple” ankle sprains with signs of syndesmosis injury had a quicker return to play. This new finding may be used by club medical teams during their initial assessment and help predict the expected time away from soccer in players with suspected high ankle sprains. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective cohort study.","This study investigates the mechanisms of ankle syndesmosis injuries in professional soccer players using high-speed video analysis. It identifies two distinct injury mechanisms and their relationship to the severity of the injury and return-to-play timelines, highlighting that ""simple"" ankle sprains with syndesmosis signs may lead to quicker recovery compared to more severe injuries."
Empirical Based Modeling for the Assessment of Dynamic Knee Stability: Implications for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk,2018-07-01,IEEE,2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),"Kristin D. Morgan, Cyril J. Donnelly, Jeffrey A. Reinbolt","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common sports injuries, costing the U.S. roughly $1 billion annually. To better understand the underlying injury mechanism, Nyquist and Bode stability criteria were applied to assess frontal plane dynamic knee stability among male Australian Football players during the weight-acceptance phase of single-leg jump landing. Out of 30 landings, 19 were classified as stable and 11 as unstable. Medial and lateral vasti, hamstring and gastrocnemii muscle activation waveforms were analyzed in parallel to determine if individuals with stable and unstable frontal plane joint biomechanics possessed different lower limb neuromuscular strategies. The total quadriceps muscle activation during the stable landings were significantly higher (p=0.02) than during the unstable landings. Additionally, the vasti exhibited a medial dominance during the stable landings compared to the unstable (p=0.06). These results suggest that individuals with unstable frontal plane knee landing mechanics may have reduced recruitment of the muscles crossing the knee; specifically, the medial muscles, which could limit their ability to compress and support the joint. The stability criteria were able to classify stable and unstable knee mechanics. And the differences in muscle activation during these stable and unstable landings provided new insights towards the ACL injury mechanism and possible injury prevention countermeasures.","This paper investigates the dynamic knee stability during single-leg jump landings among male Australian Football players to understand the mechanisms behind anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. It identifies differences in muscle activation strategies between stable and unstable landings, revealing that higher quadriceps activation and medial dominance in muscle recruitment are associated with stability, thereby offering insights for injury prevention."

Concussion Rates Differ by Practice Type and Equipment Worn in an Autonomy Five Collegiate Football Conference,2018-06-26,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Erin B. Wasserman, Mark Coberley, Scott Anderson, Murphy Grant, James Allen Hardin","Objective: Evaluate the rate of concussions across Big 12 Conference football programs based on (1) equipment worn, (2) contact level, (3) preseason practice versus in-season practice versus games, and (4) mechanism of injury for concussion. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Big 12 Conference football practices and competitions. Patients (or Participants): Big 12 Conference football teams. Assessment of Risk Factors: All Big 12 Conference institutions collected data on practice types, equipment worn, practice and game participation, and concussions during the fall, preseasons and regular seasons, from 2013 to 2016. Main Outcome Measures: Injury rates and injury rate ratios were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: From 2013 to 2016, there were 375 concussions reported [0.98/1000 athlete exposures (AEs) (95% CI, 0.88-1.08)], an average of approximately 9 concussions per team per year. Concussion rates were highest in games (5.73/1000 AE), but among practices, concussion rates were highest in full-pad (1.18/1000 AEs) and live-contact (1.28/1000 AEs) practices. Concussion rates increased with increasing contact and equipment worn. Concussion rates were higher in the preseason than in the regular season, even when stratifying by contact level and equipment worn. Conclusions: Practice concussion rates are highest during fully padded and live-contact practices, supporting limitations on practice contact and equipment worn to reduce the risk associated with head-impact exposure. Higher concussion rates in the preseason and during games indicate an effect of play intensity on concussion risk, and further research is needed to evaluate the direct effect of practice contact level and equipment guidelines and restrictions on concussion incidence.","This paper evaluates concussion rates in Big 12 Conference football programs, focusing on variables such as equipment worn, contact levels, and differences between preseason and in-season practices and games. The findings show that concussion rates are highest during games and in full-pad or live-contact practices, suggesting a need for policy adjustments on practice contact and equipment to mitigate head injury risks."

In the 5-year case-control study, male players from the first two leagues of the five top leagues in Europe, who sustained a total ACL rupture during the season 2010/11 and/or 2011/12, were included. For them and a matched control sample (ratio 1:2), data were retrieved from the publicly available and validated media-based platforms (transfermarkt.de & whoscored.com) until the end of season 2016/17. Injury and return to play-specific data were calculated as rate ratios (RR) to compare the injured and matched control athletes rates and as a survival analysis (log-rank test; career duration). Overall, 132 ACL-injuries in 125 players occurred. The RTP rate was 98.2%, and the RTP to the same level was 59.4%. Five years post-RTP, 69.9% of the ACL group were still engaged in football (RR = 87%), 40.9% at the same level (RR = 72%). Survival analysis revealed a systematic group difference in career duration compared to controls (Cox-Mantel's χ2 = 5.8; P = 0.016). Game performance (scoring points, P < 0.001; rates/number of completed passes, P = 0.048; and minutes played, P < 0.001) was lower in the ACL athletes than in the matching group in the RTP and post-RTP seasons. Although absolute and relative RTP rates after ACL reconstruction are high in professional football, career duration and game performance are lower than in the reference group.","This paper examines the return to play (RTP) rates and performance outcomes following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in top-level male football players from the five largest European leagues. The study found that while the RTP rate post-injury is high at 98.2%, both career duration and performance metrics in comparison to matched controls are significantly lower among players who suffered ACL injuries."
"Tension band plating of an anterior tibial stress fracture nonunion in an elite athlete, initially treated with intramedullary nailing: a case report",2018-06-21,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Medical Case Reports,"George A. Tsakotos, Anastasios V. Tokis, Christos G. Paganias","Leg pain in athletes is a common condition and is often related to tibial stress fracture. When non-operative treatment fails, the optimal surgical treatment is controversial. The aim of this study was to report a case of tension band plating of an anterior tibial stress fracture nonunion, treated previously with intramedullary nailing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which tension band plating was placed without removing the preexisting intramedullary nail.The tibial shaft is a common location of stress fracture in athletes. Anterior tibial stress fractures are difficult to manage. When conservative treatment fails, intramedullary nailing is the mainstay of treatment. However, nonunion is a serious complication. In our case, a non-united anterior tibial stress fracture, treated with intramedullary nailing, was addressed with the application of a compression prebended plate over the nail in a 23-year-old French man of African origin who is an elite football player. At 3-months postoperatively he was pain free and started light exercises. At 6-months postoperatively, complete radiologic union of the fracture was evident. He was symptom free; he resumed at that time a full training program and he returned to play football at preinjury high competition level.Compression plating is a valuable method of treating non-united anterior tibial stress fractures. We believe that anterior tension band plating is superior to intramedullary nailing in managing anterior tibial stress fractures, not only after failure of intramedullary nailing, but also as a first-line surgical treatment. This technique offers advantages, such as no violation of the extensor mechanism and risk of anterior knee pain, and directly addresses the underlying problem of distraction forces acting on the anterior tibial cortex and compromising fracture healing. Especially in high-level athletes, who cannot tolerate prolonged inactivity, early surgical intervention of anterior tibial stress fractures with tension band plating is a reliable option that can accelerate recovery.","This case report discusses the use of tension band plating for the treatment of an anterior tibial stress fracture nonunion in an elite football player, after an initial unsuccessful treatment with intramedullary nailing. The findings suggest that tension band plating may be a superior surgical method for managing these types of fractures, offering quicker recovery and reducing the risk of complications associated with previous treatments."
In-Season Variations in Head Impact Exposure among Youth Football Players,2018-06-20,Mary Ann Liebert Inc,Journal of Neurotrauma,"Jillian E. Urban, Mireille E. Kelley, Mark A. Espeland, Elizabeth M. Davenport, Christopher T. Whitlow, Alexander K. Powers, Joseph A. Maldjian, Joel D. Stitzel","Head impact exposure (HIE) is often summarized by the total exposure measured during the season and does not indicate how the exposure was accumulated, or how it varied during the season. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare HIE during pre-season, the first and second halves of the regular season, and playoffs in a sample of youth football players (n = 119, aged 9-13 years). Athletes were divided into one of four exposure groups based on quartiles computed from the distribution of risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWECP). Mean impacts per session and mean 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration in practices and games were compared across the four exposure groups and time frames using mixed effects models. Within games, the mean 95th percentile accelerations for the entire sample ranged from 47.2g and 2331.3 rad/sec2 during pre-season to 52.1g and 2533.4 rad/sec2 during the second half of regular season. Mean impacts per practice increased from pre-season to the second half of regular season and declined into playoffs among all exposure groups; however, the variation between time frames was not greater than two impacts per practice. Time of season had a significant relationship with mean 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration in games (both, p = 0.01) but not with practice accelerations or impacts per session. The in-practice mean levels of 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration remained fairly constant across the four time frames, but in games these changed over time depending on exposure group (interactions, p ≤ 0.05). The results of this study improve our understanding of in-season variations in HIE in youth football and may inform important opportunities for future interventions.","This study investigates head impact exposure (HIE) variations among youth football players throughout different phases of the season, including pre-season, regular season, and playoffs. Key findings indicate that while mean impacts per practice showed a decline from the second half of the regular season into playoffs, significant relationships were found between time of season and mean 95th percentile accelerations during games, enhancing the understanding of HIE in youth football for potential intervention strategies."

Castagna, Z. Milanovic, J. Bangsbo, M. B. Randers, J. Brito","The idea that football can be used as therapy and as a high-intensity and literally breath-taking training regime goes back centuries. To take one prominent example, the French philosopher Voltaire describes in the Book of Fate (1747), how a patient is cured by playing with a sacred football: ""… full-blown and carefully covered with the softest Leather. You must kick this Bladder, Sir, once a Day about your Hall for a whole Hour together, with all the Vigour and Activity you possibly can"", ""Ogul, upon making the first Experiment, was ready to expire for want of Breath"", ""In short, our Doctor in about 8 days Time, performed an absolute Cure. His Patient was as brisk, active and gay, as One in the Bloom of his Youth.""1 Today, Voltaire and his main character, philosopher Zadig, have been proved right: Football is indeed a breath-taking activity and it can be used as therapy. Albeit today's recommendations suggest a lower training frequency, longer training periods and encourage group-based training, and say that any football can be applied… Today comprehensive research has shown that small-sided football is an intense, versatile combination of strength, endurance and aerobic high-intensity interval training and that twice-weekly 1-hour sessions can be utilized for the prevention, treatment or rehabilitation of non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteopenia and prostate cancer.2-5 Likewise, various school and football club projects have shown that football has great potential to increase fitness, psycho-social well-being, motor skills, cognitive functioning, and learning.6-8 During the last century, the scientific study of football focused almost entirely on elite football. However, as of the early 2000s investigations into the fitness and health effects of football were initiated.2 The evidence regarding the application of football as a health-enhancing activity for the general population is currently expanding rapidly with more than 150 scientific articles published over the last 10 years in 35 peer-reviewed international journals, including three meta-analyses,9-11 three narrative reviews,3-5 three special issues on Football for Health12-19 and one on football, basketball, team handball, and other team sports.20 The overall conclusions are summarized in the ""Football is Medicine""-model, integrating sports science, sport training physiology, sports medicine, sports psychology and sports sociology results (Figure 1).2 The three special issues on Football for Health have all been published in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports and they tell a unique story about the development of the research and the gradually increasing focus on football as therapy. The first was published in 2010 focusing on ""Football as prevention"",12-14 the second in 2014 expanded on the work on ""Football as prevention and treatment"",15-19 and the present special issue published in 2018 is entitled ""Football is Medicine"" and emphasizes the comprehensive results and the huge implications of using the world's most popular sport, with an estimated 500 million regular participants,2 as a therapy. Relying on this scientific base with contributions from more than 250 authors from 22 countries, the scientific ""Football is Medicine"" platform has now been established. The first organizational meeting took place in Odense, Denmark, in January 2017, with 25 international researchers present and the first ""Football is Medicine"" conference was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in January 2018, with 50 speakers and a total of 300 delegates, with the Portuguese FA (FPF) as the main organizers and the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), The Danish FA (DBU) and UEFA as partners. It is a pleasure to confirm that the second Football is Medicine Conference will be held on January 25-26, 2019 in Odense, Denmark, with symposia on training in the evidence-based football concepts Football Fitness, FIT FIRST and 11 for Health on January 21-24, 2019, organized by SDU with DBU, FPF, and UEFA as partners. The purposes and possibilities of the global Football is Medicine platform are multifaceted, with research quality and productivity, scientific collaboration and networking, research dissemination as well as the development of an education in evidence-based football programs as the most prominent. The ongoing and future research into the effects of football training on human health is interesting and ambitious, with small-to-medium RCT projects on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, severe obesity and several types of cancer running or planned in Europe, South America, North America, Asia and Africa, and a large-scale multicentre project on Football Fitness in Europe. Pilot projects, feasibility studies, and small-scale RCT projects are also running for refugees and socially deprived groups as well as patient subsets with Parkinson's disease, dementia, psoriasis, asthma and anxiety, and it is being investigated whether Walking Football is a feasible and valid alternative to ""running football"" to achieve conspicuous health effects for patient groups.21 Long-term training studies and implementation projects are also being conducted with football for men with prostate cancer and Football Fitness for young, middle-aged and elderly women.19, 22 In all of these projects it is encouraged to take a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary perspective and to integrate expertise and research questions from sports science, sport training physiology, sports medicine, sports psychology and sports sociology.2 The plans for global research dissemination and implementation are equally ambitious. With regard to research dissemination, there will be a focus on research articles and special issues in high-quality peer-reviewed international journals, like the present issue, with audio-visual coverage of the main results, including these, and with evidence-based popular articles, booklets and books published for the general population as well as healthcare workers and authorities. With regard to implementation there will be emphasis on global dissemination of evidence-based concepts with football training for children (FIT FIRST7, 8 and 11 for Health6, 8) and sedentary adults and patient groups (Football Fitness2-5, 9-22), but also evidence-based programmes using, for example, elite football clubs to promote healthy diet and everyday life physical activity for fans (FFIT23/EuroFIT24). For such large-scale implementation plans to succeed, a close collaboration is required between important stakeholders in the scientific community, the football governing bodies, the worldwide health organizations and national authorities. We look forward to contributing to this work. Fifteen years of research have produced strong evidence to show that football is indeed breath-taking, high-intensity, multipurpose training and is effective as physical and psycho-social therapy. In fact, football is medicine, and we are ready to act on this knowledge! The authors would like to thank the contributors in this present special issue and all the researchers that have contributed to the football for health work over the last 15 years.

A novel approach to enhance ACL injury prevention programs,2018-06-18,Wiley,Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics,"Alli Gokeler, Romain Seil, Gino Kerkhoffs, Evert Verhagen","Efficacy studies have demonstrated decreased anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rates for athletes participating in injury prevention programs. Typically, ACL injury prevention programs entail a combination of plyometrics, strength training, agility and balance exercises. Unfortunately, improvements of movement patterns are not sustained over time. The reason may be related to the type of instructions given during training. Encouraging athletes to consciously control knee movements during exercises may not be optimal for the acquisition of complex motor skills as needed in complex sports environments. In the motor learning domain, these types of instructions are defined as an internal attentional focus. An internal focus, on one's own movements results in a more conscious type of control that may hamper motor learning. It has been established in numerous studies that an external focus of attention facilitates motor learning more effectively due to the utilization of automatic motor control. Subsequently, the athlete has more recourses available to anticipate on situations on the field and take appropriate feed forward directed actions. The purpose of this manuscript was to present methods to optimize motor skill acquisition of athletes and elaborate on athletes' behavior.","This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing ACL injury prevention programs by emphasizing the importance of external focus of attention during training. It argues that adopting this method facilitates better motor skill acquisition and improves athletes' performance in complex sports environments, ultimately reducing ACL injury rates."
Metabolic Power in Team Sports - Part 1: An Update,2018-06-14,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Pietro di Prampero, Cristian Osgnach","Abstract Team sports are characterised by frequent episodes of accelerated/decelerated running. The corresponding energy cost can be estimated on the basis of the biomechanical equivalence between accelerated/decelerated running on flat terrain and constant speed running uphill/downhill. This approach allows one to: (i) estimate the time course of the instantaneous metabolic power requirement of any given player and (ii) infer therefrom the overall energy expenditure of any given time window of a soccer drill or match. In the original approach, walking and running were aggregated and energetically considered as running, even if in team sports several walking periods are interspersed among running bouts. However, since the transition speed between walking and running is known for any given incline of the terrain, we describe here an approach to identify walking episodes, thus utilising the corresponding energy cost which is smaller than in running. In addition, the new algorithm also takes into account the energy expenditure against the air resistance, for both walking and running. The new approach yields overall energy expenditure values, for a whole match,≈14% smaller than the original algorithm; moreover, it shows that the energy expenditure against the air resistance is≈2% of the total.","This paper provides an updated method for estimating metabolic power requirements in team sports, particularly soccer, by differentiating between walking and running episodes during gameplay. The new algorithm reduces overall energy expenditure estimates by about 14% compared to previous methods and incorporates energy costs associated with air resistance, which accounts for approximately 2% of total energy expenditure."
A Biomechanical Comparison of Single-Leg Landing and Unplanned Sidestepping,2018-06-14,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Chamnan Chinnasee, Gillian Weir, Siriporn Sasimontonkul, Jacqueline Alderson, Cyril Donnelly","Abstract Unplanned sidestepping and single-leg landing have both been used to screen athletes for injury risk in sport. The aim of this study was to directly compare the lower limb mechanics of three single-leg landing tasks and an unplanned sidestepping task. Thirteen elite female team sport athletes completed a series of non-contact single-leg drop landings, single-leg countermovement jumps, single-leg jump landings and unplanned sidestepping in a randomized counterbalanced design. Three dimensional kinematics (250 Hz) and ground reaction force (2,000 Hz) data with a participant specific lower limb skeletal model were used to calculate and compare hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics, peak joint moments, instantaneous joint power and joint work during the weight acceptance phase of each sporting task (α=0.05). Peak knee joint moments and relevant injury risk thresholds were used to classify each athlete's anterior cruciate ligament injury risk during unplanned sidestepping and single-leg jump landing. Results showed that peak joint moments, power and work were greater during the single-leg jump landing task when compared to the single-leg drop landings and single-leg countermovement jumps tasks. Peak frontal and sagittal plane knee joint moments, knee joint power, as well as hip and knee joint work were greater during unplanned sidestepping when compared to the landing tasks. Peak ankle joint moments, power and work were greater during the landing tasks when compared to unplanned sidestepping. For 4 of the 13 athletes tested, their anterior cruciate ligament injury risk classification changed depending on whether they performed an unplanned sidestepping or single-leg jump landing testing procedure. To summarize, a single-leg jump landing testing procedure places a larger mechanical on the ankle joint when compared to single-leg drop landings, single-leg countermovement jumps and unplanned sidestepping. An unplanned sidestepping testing procedure places a larger mechanical demand on the knee joint when compared to single-leg landing tasks. Both unplanned sidestepping and single-leg jump landing testing procedures are recommended for classifying an athlete's anterior cruciate ligament injury risk in sport.","This paper compares the lower limb mechanics during single-leg landing tasks and unplanned sidestepping to assess injury risk in athletes. The findings indicate that single-leg jump landings impose greater mechanical demands on the ankle joint, while unplanned sidestepping places a higher load on the knee joint, suggesting both tasks are valuable for evaluating anterior cruciate ligament injury risk."

Bowlegs and Intensive Football Training in Children and Adolescents,2018-06-07,Deutscher Arzte-Verlag GmbH,Deutsches Ärzteblatt international,"Peter Helmut Thaller, Julian Fürmetz, Fuhuan Chen, Nikolaus Degen, Kirsi Marjaana Manz, Florian Wolf","Background: In many countries around the world, football (association football, or predominantly in North America) is the sport most commonly played by children and adolescents. It is widely thought that football players are more likely to develop genu varum (bowlegs);an association with knee arthritis also seems likely. The goals of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to provide an overview of the available evidence on genu varum after intensive soccer training in childhood and adolescence, and to discuss the possible pathogenetic mechanisms. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for studies of the relation between leg axis development and intensive football playing during the growing years. Results: Controlled studies employing the intercondylar distance (ICD) as the target variable were evaluated in a meta-analysis, with the mean difference as a measure of effect strength. This meta-analysis included 3 studies with a total of 1344 football players and 1277 control individuals. All three studies individually showed a significant difference in the mean ICD values of the two groups. The pooled effect estimator for the mean difference was 1.50 cm (95% confidence interval [0.53;2.46]). Two further studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis had similar conclusions. Asymmetrical, varus muscle forces and predominantly varus stress on the osseous growth plates neighboring the knee joint, especially during the prepubertal growth spurt, seem to be the cause of this phenomenon. Conclusion: Intensive soccer playing during the growing years can promote the development of bowlegs (genu varum) and, in turn, increase the risk of knee arthritis. Physicians should inform young athletes and their parents of this if asked to advise about the choice of soccer as a sport for intensive training. It cannot be concluded, however, that football predisposes to bowlegs when played merely as a leisure activity.","This paper examines the relationship between intensive football training and the development of genu varum (bowlegs) in children and adolescents. The systematic review and meta-analysis, which included over 2,600 individuals, found significant differences in leg axis development between football players and control groups, suggesting that intensive soccer participation may lead to an increased risk of bowlegs and potentially knee arthritis, particularly during prepubertal growth."

Voluntari team players and counting of these issues; making the players aware of how they fulfill the tactical responsibilities of an official game and giving immediate feedback by systematically presenting the tactical actions performed by the players in each game. Methods. The following methods were used to conduct this research: study of the specialized literature documents; discussion method; method of observation and recording, statistical-mathematical and graphical representation method. The study was carried out in “F. C. Voluntari” Football Club. The observation, discussions, obtained data and records took place throughout the Championships of Division B, 2009-2010 edition. The measurements referred to: recording by observation and assistance in official and friendly games, both in and out, during the team training sessions as well; data comparison; determination of the share of “shots for goal “ of the players included in this team. The records began in the 2nd stage, on August 17, 2009 and were concluded on May 24, 2010, in the 28th stage of that competitive season. There were made 15 sheets monitoring the number of shots: by distance, by execution pattern (from stationary moments and from action), all over the game, divided into 2 halves and 5 record protocols during the training sessions. Results. The analysis of the results proves the evolution of the shot on goal technique which is essentially determined by the discovery and highlighting of biomechanics data and which influenced decisively the performance level all over the years. The changes occurred in the shot technique were supported in parallel by special modifications of the training, especially with regard to the development of motor skills (strength, speed) aiming to increase the efficiency. The study demonstrated that the team of F. C. Voluntari Bucharest, implementing the programs for long shot improvement in their training sessions, achieved the expected results and reached the objectives set for the current season. A higher efficiency of the shots made from action was found out, namely: 65.1% of the shots were made from action and only 34.9% from stationary phases. Conclusion. In order to achieve performance, the practice of the shots on goal is an essential factor of the football game. This can be done in special training sessions, using the records of the games.","This paper investigates techniques to improve long shots on goal within an elite football team, specifically F. C. Voluntari, by analyzing the team's technical-tactical profile through official game records. It highlights the significance of training adaptations and player awareness regarding tactical responsibilities, ultimately demonstrating that enhanced training programs resulted in a notable increase in shooting efficiency from action during competitive play."
Previous foot injuries associated with a greater likelihood of Achilles tendon ruptures in professional American football players,2018-06-04,Informa UK Limited,The Physician and Sportsmedicine,"Michael K. Krill, Joshua Hoffman, JaeWon Yang, Johnathan D. Hodax, Brett D. Owens, Timothy E. Hewett","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to build on current understanding of Achilles tendon (AT) ruptures in football through the examination of lower extremity injury rates (IR) in the season prior to AT rupture.Methods: An online review was conducted to document AT ruptures in the National Football League (NFL) from the 2010–11 through 2016–17 seasons. Player-specific information was gathered through the online search, injury reports, or video analysis. Injury incidence was recorded for each season. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. IRs per 1000 athlete-exposures with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were established. Injury rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CI were calculated to evaluate differences in IR with statistical significance established at p < 0.05.Results: From the 2010–11 to 2016–17 NFL seasons, 109 AT ruptures were identified. 36 athletes participated in the NFL the season prior and sustained a total of 40 injuries. Thirty-two (32/40, 80%) of the injuries involved the lower extremity. The most frequent body parts injured in the NFL season prior to AT rupture were the knee (n = 8, 22.5%), upper leg and thigh (n = 7, 17.5%), lower leg and shin (n = 5, 12.5%), and ankle (n = 5, 12.5%). The overall IR for the AT rupture group was not significantly different than the NFL group (IRR: 0.94, 0.68–1.31 95% CI, p = 0.73). The AT rupture group demonstrated a significantly increased rate of foot injuries compared to the NFL cohort (IRR: 2.58, 1.16–5.77 95% CI, p = 0.02).Conclusion: There was an increased identified incidence of AT ruptures in the NFL from 2010 to 2017 compared to AT ruptures reported from 1997 to 2002. There was no significant difference in lower extremity IR the season prior to AT rupture. Only foot injuries demonstrated an increased IR the season prior to AT rupture compared to an NFL cohort. Eleven athletes sustained 2 AT ruptures and all 11 players sustained the subsequent AT rupture to the contralateral limb.","This study investigates the relationship between previous foot injuries and the likelihood of Achilles tendon ruptures in professional American football players. It finds that while lower extremity injury rates did not significantly differ before tendon ruptures, there is a notably increased incidence of foot injuries in players who subsequently suffered Achilles tendon ruptures."
Influence of Maximal Running Shoes on Biomechanics Before and After a 5K Run,2018-06-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Christine D. Pollard, Justin A. Ter Har, J.J. Hannigan, Marc F. Norcross","Background: Lower extremity injuries are common among runners. Recent trends in footwear have included minimal and maximal running shoe types. Maximal running shoes are unique because they provide the runner with a highly cushioned midsole in both the rearfoot and forefoot. However, little is known about how maximal shoes influence running biomechanics. Purpose: To examine the influence of maximal running shoes on biomechanics before and after a 5-km (5K) run as compared with neutral running shoes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen female runners participated in 2 testing sessions (neutral shoe session and maximal shoe session), with 7 to 10 days between sessions. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected while participants ran along a 10-m runway. After 5 running trials, participants completed a 5K treadmill run, followed by 5 additional running trials. Variables of interest included impact peak of the vertical ground-reaction force, loading rate, and peak eversion. Differences were determined by use of a series of 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance models (shoe × time). Results: A significant main effect was found for shoe type for impact peak and loading rate. When the maximal shoe was compared with the neutral shoe before and after the 5K run, participants exhibited an increased loading rate (mean ± SE: pre–maximal shoe, 81.15 body weights/second [BW/s] and pre–neutral shoe, 60.83 BW/s [ P &lt; .001]; post–maximal shoe, 79.10 BW/s and post–neutral shoe, 61.22 BW/s [ P = .008]) and increased impact peak (pre–maximal shoe, 1.76 BW and pre–neutral shoe, 1.58 BW [ P = .004]; post–maximal shoe, 1.79 BW and post–neutral shoe, 1.55 BW [ P = .003]). There were no shoe × time interactions and no significant findings for peak eversion. Conclusion: Runners exhibited increased impact forces and loading rate when running in a maximal versus neutral shoe. Because increases in these variables have been associated with an increased risk of running-related injuries, runners who are new to running in a maximal shoe may be at an increased risk of injury. Clinical Relevance: Understanding the influence of running footwear as an intervention that affects running biomechanics is important for clinicians so as to reduce patient injury.","The paper investigates the impact of maximal running shoes on biomechanics, specifically focusing on the changes in impact peak and loading rate during running before and after a 5K run compared to neutral shoes. The results indicate that runners experience increased loading rates and impact forces when using maximal shoes, which may elevate the risk of running-related injuries."
Necessary Steps to Accelerate the Integration of Wearable Sensors Into Recreation and Competitive Sports,2018-06-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Current Sports Medicine Reports,"Peter Düking, Christian Stammel, Billy Sperlich, Shaun Sutehall, Borja Muniz-Pardos, Giscard Lima, Liam Kilduff, Iphigenia Keramitsoglou, Guoping Li, Fabio Pigozzi, Yannis P. Pitsiladis","Background A variety of wearable sensor technologies (herein referred to as “wearables”) are being developed by an ever-increasing number of companies and receiving considerable attention from the athletic community. Wearables can be defined as small, lightweight devices worn on, close to, or even in the body where they monitor, analyze, transmit, and/or receive data from other devices and/or cloud services to provide biofeedback in real time to the user (1). Wearables can be used by a wide range of individuals engaged in activities of daily living or training and competing as amateur or professional athletes. Wearables may be used to monitor and analyze physiological parameters and individualize training programs to enhance performance and/or health (2–4). Pedometers were among the first wearables developed to measure physical activity by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci some 500 years ago (5). da Vinci’s mechanism was designed to measure vertical movements by moving a lever up and down, resulting in the rotation of a gear and this remains the basis of modern day devices. Major advances in technology over the past two decades have resulted in the triaxial accelerometer that measures movements in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical direction, alleviating the limitations of previous devices (6). Accelerometry-based wearables can be used to objectively assess physical activity and interventions aimed at improving health-related outcomes (7). In professional rugby union, a device that incorporates Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), accelerometry, and gyroscope technology is now routinely fitted to the underside of each player’s jersey between the shoulder blades. These wearable microsensors allow player movement to be recorded and reported live during match-play, providing team coaches with key performance “metrics” such as total distance covered by a player in match play, number of accelerations and decelerations, and “impact” (8) during any given contact or tackle. It is claimed that these performance metrics enable team coaches to track and plan the match play strategy. Changes in sporting rules and regulations have facilitated the use of these devices. For example, the Competition Rule 144 d of the International Association of Athletics Federations (2018 to 2019) on assistance allows “Heart rate or speed distance monitors or stride sensors or similar devices carried or worn personally by athletes during an event, provided that such device cannot be used to communicate with any other person” (9). Rules such as this promote the use of wearables in elite sport and encourage companies to develop these tools to facilitate high-level performance. Wearable technology emerged as the top fitness trend in a worldwide survey conducted recently by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (10), predicting sales of U.S. $1.5 to U.S. $2.5 billion for some devices and prompting the statement that “it is unpredictable how wearable technology will advance through the next decade.” Advances in wearable innovations are being presented by an increasing number of companies at international wearable technology conferences (e.g., Medical Wearables 2018 (11)). The main marketing claim being low cost and easy-to-use wearables that allow noninvasive or minimally invasive monitoring of a variety of physiological and biomechanical parameters, which in the past were simply not possible, or only measurable with sophisticated, time-consuming, and costly laboratory procedures. For example, contact lenses may be used to continuously monitor glucose levels (12), soccer shoes may improve kicking accuracy (13), and fabrics may be commercially available to monitor vital signs such as respiratory rate (14). Despite the revolutionary potential of wearables, there are well-founded concerns about the wearable industry (15). The main criticisms relate to the lack of evidence for the beneficial effects of analysing a specific parameter in a given context or isolation, the quality of hardware and provided data, information overload, data security, and exaggerated marketing claims (1,15–17). For these reasons, athletes, regulatory bodies, and relevant stakeholders are becoming increasingly sceptical about wearables. The questionable reputation of some wearables is having a detrimental effect on the reputation of evidence-based devices. Aggressive and exaggerated marketing claims and the hasty launch of wearable products with no, or only internal validation and reliability studies, and no external evaluation, are highly problematic (15). Wearable devices that use biological data for health purposes ought to be required to undergo rigorous evaluation before being launched on the market, similar to the process pharmaceutical industries use to test their products (15). Backing up the marketing claims of wearable technology developers with independent scientific evidence would positively impact sports, fitness, and health market. Failure to do so should be subject to financial and other penalties as happened in the past (18,19). Wearable technology that is backed by quality science will be more profitable and sustainable in the long run, and the companies involved will have a much higher return on their investment. Current Applications A recent example used in elite sport and associated with the International Federation of Sports Medicine (FIMS) is the mobile application developed by sport scientists and engineers for the Sub2hrs marathon project (20,21). The Sub2hrs project is the first dedicated international multidisciplinary research initiative to include scientists from academia, elite athletes, and strategic industry partners with the aim of running a sub two-hour marathon while promoting doping-free and fair sport. The Sub2 mobile application (Fig. 1) was developed to serve as a “hub” to aggregate a range of data feeds to assist elite runners and their support teams to improve athletic performance. In addition, the “hub” is intended to improve the experience of spectators through real time broadcasting of information pertaining to the “live” performance. This application can provide highly precise real-time measures for athletes and their support teams, such as distance run and speed using a proprietary algorithm. A number of sensors to measure heart rate, running economy, and core temperature along with other physiological and kinematic parameters (e.g., contact time, cadence, strike angle) can be integrated to provide a holistic and comprehensive overview of the activity and its impact on the athlete. The app provides a live data feed of land and air temperature based on geostationary satellite data as well as state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. This is facilitated through a Cloud-based portal allowing the athlete support team to view the data on a desktop, tablet, or a smartphone in real time anywhere around the globe with internet access. The Sub2 mobile application runs on smartwatches with the Android Wear 2.0 operating system and standalone connectivity, overcoming the need for the smart watch to be paired to a smartphone (Fig. 1). Historically, such capacity to transmit biometric data such as body temperature, pace, cadence, heart rate, and breathing rate in real time during a race was only possible using tablets held by nearby cyclists following the runners at all times (22) or by recording singular data points at predetermined distances or times along the course. The app performance was tested on an elite female athlete during the recent Seville marathon (Fig. 2). Physiological and biomechanical parameters were monitored and transmitted live to scientific support staff in the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Ethiopia through the Sub2 mobile application.Figure 1: The Sub2 mobile application.Figure 2: An example of the output during a competitive marathon.Daily life is becoming increasingly sedentary, and physical inactivity is a global pandemic. Applications and wearables have great potential as tools to promote and increase the levels of daily physical activity (23). Although the use of this technology is a promising alternative to combat inactivity, the efficacy of this approach remains to be determined. In a recent multidisciplinary review of 111 studies (24), less than one third were optimized for effectiveness, engagement, and acceptability and the review concluded that guidelines were needed to facilitate the synthesis of evidence across disciplines. Scientific Basis of Wearable Parameters The potential to measure almost every foreseeable parameter with a wearable device is real. However, not every parameter is practical for either the recreational or competitive athlete (17). Using the prior Rugby Union example, monitoring the covered distance during match play and/or training using GNSS may provide some interesting information but knowing the covered distance per se is unlikely to optimize performance and/or reduce the likelihood of injuries. There are increased efforts to understand the relationship between covered distances in different intensity zones and the likelihood of injury (25–28). In this context, it is important not to confuse the association between a parameter (in this case the covered distance) and an outcome (in this case the likelihood of injury) with the predictive power of a parameter as it was shown that despite being associated, parameters are not always good for prediction (29,30). Research to develop evidence-based algorithms that support the use of specific parameters to predict injuries and potentially aid in injury prevention is needed. It is important to investigate the interaction between monitored parameters and aspects of performance and/or health that wearables may detect. Collaborative efforts between sport practitioners, engineers, data analysts, sports medicine personnel, and other relevant groups will form a science base for the application of this technology. Easy access to raw data from wearable devices would speed advances and benefit the athlete, scientific community, manufacturer, and practitioner. Wearable companies typically work in isolation to safeguard their intellectual property. In the future, if wearable companies are to become more evidence-based in their approach, they will need to develop multidisciplinary teams that place greater value on research and development. Quality Control Quality control of the hardware and the data generated is crucial for wearables to improve athlete performance and health. While there are many wearables that claim to deliver reliable and valid data to the user (31,32), few wearables have had rigorous independent testing (1). Independent research institutions should at least test for the validity and reliability of wearable technology before releasing the products on the market (1,33). Recommendations exist for the assessment of reliability, sensitivity, and validity of data provided by wearables (34). Hardware also should be tested to reduce the risk of harm to the user. Third party, independently verified quality assurance, durability (battery life), survivability (water resistance), and data protection would significantly enhance a products reputation and potential use (35,36). Good quality control of the hardware, the safety, and privacy of the data would increase the reliability of the data generated and improve the comparison between devices. Improving User Interface Wearables need to be simple and time-efficient for a high level of compliance and usage (33). Monitoring simple subjective data (e.g., ratings of perceived exertion) can be done with a touch interface and advancements in speech and voice recognition allow more complex data to be gathered verbally (37). Collaboration with athletes is needed to determine the most suitable form of instant feedback, that is, what information do they need to know to improve performance while not being distracted from their surroundings. Regardless of the presentation medium (e.g., smartwatch, smartphone, ""hearables,"" etc.), the information needs to be in an informative and easily understandable format (38). This is critical, especially when the slightest distraction may decrease performance in disciplines where concentration is paramount to success (e.g., Formula 1, MotoGP, cycling, and skiing) and participant safety. In the future, biofeedback that is not provided instantly could possibly be provided in a virtual reality environment allowing the athlete to receive the feedback and implement strategies to improve aspects of performance (39). Future studies are needed to evaluate the most useful and suitable form of feedback for different athletic tasks and disciplines and to present the data in an understandable and attractive format (38). Data Collection and Handling To enhance high-level performance, a variety of multiple wearables will likely need to be connected to gather the relevant data within a single database for interpretation. Data that are standardized and easy to share will enhance and facilitate collaboration and big data analytics may identify new relationships between the parameters measured, further enhancing sports performance and health (1,40,41). Developing such large databases and the algorithms they may produce will require the collaborative effort of data service providers, exercise scientists, athletes, and data analysts to generate meaningful and useful information. The motivation to use wearables varies between the populations using them. However, if production of the device is not sustainable and the data is not reliable, valid and/or actionable, no one will ever benefit from this technology. Concluding Remarks In the future, athletes will have the option to use an increasing number of wearables and each new device should add beneficial information to the training process with the goal of helping sports scientists and health care providers improve their athlete’s or patient’s performance and/or health. Sharing data and knowledge between the athletes, exercise scientists, hardware and software engineers, and other stakeholders has the potential to improve wearable devices and technology for competitive athletes.","This paper discusses the integration of wearable sensor technologies in recreation and competitive sports, highlighting their potential to monitor and analyze physiological parameters for performance and health enhancement. It emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation of wearables to ensure their reliability and effectiveness, alongside calls for collaboration among stakeholders to advance the development of evidence-based wearable technology."
Passive Hip Range-of-Motion Values Across Sex and Sport,2018-06-01,National Athletic Trainers' Association,Journal of Athletic Training,"Jennifer A. Hogg, Randy J. Schmitz, Anh-Dung Nguyen, Sandra J. Shultz","Greater passive hip range of motion (ROM) has been associated with greater dynamic knee valgus and thus the potential for increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Normative data for passive hip ROM by sex are lacking. To establish and compare passive hip ROM values by sex and sport and to quantify side-to-side differences in internal-rotation ROM (ROMIR), external-rotation ROM (ROMER), and total ROM (ROMTOT). Cross-sectional study. Station-based, preparticipation screening. A total of 339 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes, consisting of 168 women (age = 19.2 ± 1.2 years, height = 169.0 ± 7.2 cm, mass = 65.3 ± 10.2 kg) and 171 men (age = 19.4 ± 1.3 years, height = 200.0 ± 8.6 cm, mass = 78.4 ± 12.0 kg) in 6 sports screened over 3 years: soccer (58 women, 67 men), tennis (20 women, 22 men), basketball (28 women, 22 men), softball or baseball (38 women, 31 men), cross-country (18 women, 19 men), and golf (6 women, 10 men). Passive hip ROM was measured with the athlete lying prone with the hip abducted to 20° to 30° and knee flexed to 90°. The leg was passively internally and externally rotated until the point of sacral movement. Three measures were averaged for each direction and leg and used for analysis. We compared ROMIR, ROMER, ROMTOT (ROMTOT = ROMIR + ROMER), and relative ROM (ROMREL = ROMIR - ROMER) between sexes and among sports using separate 2 × 6 repeated-measures analyses of variance. Women had greater ROMIR (38.1° ± 8.2° versus 28.6° ± 8.4°; F1,327 = 91.74, P < .001), ROMTOT (72.1° ± 10.6° versus 64.4° ± 10.1°; F1,327 = 33.47, P < .001), and ROMREL (1.5° ± 16.0° versus -7.6° ± 16.5°; F1,327 = 37.05, P < .001) than men but similar ROMER (34.0° ± 12.2° versus 35.8° ± 11.5°; F1,327 = 1.65, P = .20) to men. Cross-country athletes exhibited greater ROMIR (37.0° ± 9.3° versus 30.9° ± 9.4° to 33.3° ± 9.5°; P = .001) and ROMREL (5.9° ± 18.3° versus -9.6° ± 16.9° to -2.7° ± 17.3°; P = .001) and less ROMER (25.7° ± 7.5° versus 35.0° ± 13.0° to 40.2° ± 12.0°; P < .001) than basketball, soccer, softball or baseball, and tennis athletes. They also displayed less ROMTOT (62.7° ± 8.1° versus 70.0° ± 9.1° to 72.9° ± 11.9°; P < .001) than basketball, softball or baseball, and tennis athletes. Women had greater ROMIR than men, resulting in greater ROMTOT and ROMREL. Researchers should examine the extent to which this greater bias toward ROMIR may explain women's greater tendency for dynamic knee valgus. With the exception of cross-country, ROM values were similar across sports. The clinical implications of these aberrant cross-country values require further study.","This paper investigates passive hip range-of-motion (ROM) values across different sexes and sports, emphasizing the potential link between greater hip ROM and an increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Findings reveal that women exhibit greater internal rotation, total ROM, and relative ROM compared to men, while cross-country athletes display unique ROM profiles compared to athletes from other sports, suggesting a need for further investigation into the implications of these variations."
Weightbearing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and sagittal plane kinematics during single leg drop jump landing in healthy male athletes,2018-06-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Brittany Dowling, April L. Mcpherson, James M. Paci","Passive ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (DROM) measures have been identified as a risk factor for injury during landings. However, passive measurements might not be indicative of dynamic ankle movement, whereas a weightbearing ROM might be a better tool when evaluating movement. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between weightbearing DROM and sagittal plane landing mechanics in a single leg drop jump task.Seventy-three male athletes (22.1±3.9 years old, height 186.2±11 cm, and weight 100.2±21.8 kg) performed bilateral modified-lunge tasks and bilateral single leg drop jump landings while 3D kinematic data were collected. Hip, knee, and ankle joint angles were calculated at initial contact (IC) maximum knee flexion (MKF), and total excursion (TE) during a single leg drop jump landing.No bilateral differences in DROM and single leg landing mechanics existed. Decreased ankle DROM was correlated to decreased ankle dorsiflexion at MKF (P=0.00) and TE (P=0.00) for both dominant and non-dominant limbs. Decreased ankle DROM was also correlated to decreased knee flexion at IC (P=0.00), MKF (P=0.00), and TE (P=0.1), for both dominant and non-dominant limbs. Ankle DROM correlated to hip flexion at MKF (r=0.25) and TE (r=0.30) in the dominant limb.Restrictions in DROM may contribute to a stiff landing with less flexion at the ankle and knee. These findings may be useful in designing training programs aimed at increasing DROM in order to improve an athlete's landing mechanics and decrease risk of injury.","The paper investigates the relationship between weightbearing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (DROM) and sagittal plane kinematics during single leg drop jump landings in male athletes. It finds that decreased ankle DROM correlates with restrictions in joint flexion at the ankle and knee, suggesting that improving DROM could enhance landing mechanics and reduce injury risk."
Fifth metatarsal stress fracture in elite male football players: an on-field analysis of plantar loading,2018-06-01,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Athol Thomson, Richard Akenhead, Rodney Whiteley, Pieter D'Hooghe, Ken Van Alsenoy, Chris Bleakley","Evaluate plantar loading during 'on-field' common football movements in players after fifth metatarsal (MT-5) stress fracture and compare with matched healthy players.Fourteen elite male soccer players participated in the study conducted on a natural grass playing surface using firm ground football boots. Seven players who had suffered a primary stress fracture (MT-5 group) and seven matched healthy players (controls, CON) performed three common football movements while in-shoe plantar loading data were collected.Large between-group differences exist for maximal vertical force normalised to bodyweight (Fmax) at the lateral toes (2-5) of the stance leg during a set-piece kick (MT-5: 0.2±0.06 bodyweight (BW), CON: 0.1±0.05 BW, effect size (ES) 1.4) and the curved run where the MT-5 group showed higher Fmax with very large effect size at the lateral forefoot of the injured (closest to curve) limb when running a curve to receive a pass (MT-5 injured-CON=0.01 BW, ES 1.5). Small between-group differences were evident during straight-line running. However, between-limb analysis of MT-5 group showed significant unloading of the lateral forefoot region of the involved foot.Elite male football players who have returned to play after MT-5 stress fracture display significantly higher maximum plantar force at the lateral forefoot and lateral toes (2-5) compared with healthy matched control players during two football movements (kick and curved run) with the magnitude of these differences being very large. These findings may have important implications for manipulating regional load during rehabilitation or should a player report lateral forefoot prodromal symptoms.","This paper investigates plantar loading in elite male football players who have recovered from a fifth metatarsal stress fracture compared to matched healthy players during common football movements.

Work-Related Injury and Management Strategies Among Certified Athletic Trainers,2018-06-01,National Athletic Trainers' Association,Journal of Athletic Training,"Kristen L. Kucera, Hester J. Lipscomb, Karen G. Roos, John M. Dement, Jennifer M. Hootman","Context: Health care workers have high rates of musculoskeletal injuries, but many of these injuries go unreported to workers' compensation and national surveillance systems. Little is known regarding the work-related injuries of certified athletic trainers (ATs). Objective: To determine the 12-month incidence and prevalence of work-related injuries and describe injury-reporting and -management strategies. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Population-based online survey. Patients or Other Participants: Of the 29 051 ATs currently certified by the Board of Certification, Inc, who “opted in” to research studies, we randomly selected 10 000. Of these, 1826 (18.3%) ATs currently working in the clinical setting were eligible and participated in the baseline survey. Main Outcome Measure(s): An online survey was e-mailed in May of 2012. We assessed self-reported work-related injuries in the previous 12 months and management strategies including medical care, work limitations or modifications, and time off work. Statistics (frequencies and percentages) were calculated to describe injury rates per 200 000 work hours, injury prevalence, injury characteristics, and injury-reporting and -management strategies. Results: A total of 247 ATs reported 419 work-related injuries during the previous 12 months, for an incidence rate of 21.6 per 200 000 hours (95% confidence interval = 19.6, 23.7) and injury prevalence of 13.5% (95% confidence interval = 12.0%, 15.1%). The low back (26%), hand/fingers (9%), and knee (9%) were frequently affected body sites. Injuries were most often caused by bodily motion/overexertion/repetition (52%), contact with objects/equipment/persons (24%), or slips/trips/falls (15%). More than half of injured ATs (55.5%) sought medical care, 25% missed work, and most (77%) did not file a workers' compensation claim for their injury. Half of injured ATs were limited at work (n = 125), and 89% modified or changed their athletic training work as a result of the injury. Conclusions: More than half of AT work-related injuries required medical care or work limitations and were not reported for workers' compensation. Understanding how ATs care for and manage their work-related injuries is important given that few take time off work.","The paper investigates the incidence and management strategies of work-related injuries among certified athletic trainers (ATs) through a cross-sectional survey. It highlights that a significant number of ATs experience musculoskeletal injuries, with common body sites being the lower back, hands, and knees, and emphasizes the need for improved reporting and management of these injuries, as many ATs do not file workers' compensation claims."

During LA, subjects performed CO, BP, and forward sprints with split times taken between 0-3 and 3-5 yd and ground reaction forces recorded 0 and 3 yd from the start. During CoD testing, subjects performed the CO or BP for 3 yd and then were given a cue to sprint to a gate 5 yd away in 1 of 4 directions (downfield, midfield, sideline, or upfield). In LA, CO was faster than BP between 0-3 yd (Δ -0.20 ± 0.02 seconds, p = 0.000) and 3-5 yd (Δ -0.12 ± 0.02 seconds, p = 0.000). At the start of the movement, CO demonstrated greater propulsive forces (p = 0.017). However, 3 yd from the start, CO demonstrated greater propulsive forces and reduced braking forces (p = 0.000 & 0.003). In CoD, CO was faster than BP when running in the downfield (Δ 0.21 ± 0.05 seconds, p = 0.044) and lateral directions (Δ 0.21 ± 0.08 seconds, p = 0.035), but similar in the upfield direction (Δ 0.01 ± 0.08, p = 0.986). Our results indicate that CO is superior to BP in LA, CoD ability, and movement efficiency and support the use of CO for defensive backs.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of two techniques—backpedal (BP) and cross-over (CO) runs—used by defensive backs in American football concerning linear acceleration (LA) and change of direction (CoD) ability. The findings reveal that CO outperforms BP in both LA and CoD, suggesting CO's advantages in movement efficiency and propulsive forces, thereby endorsing its implementation for defensive backs."
Fluctuations in blood biomarkers of head trauma in NCAA football athletes over the course of a season,2018-05-29,Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group (JNSPG),Journal of Neurosurgery,"Jonathan M. Oliver, Anthony J. Anzalone, Jason D. Stone, Stephanie M. Turner, Damond Blueitt, J. Craig Garrison, Andrew T. Askow, Joel A. Luedke, Andrew R. Jagim","OBJECTIVE Repetitive subconcussive head trauma is a consequence of participation in contact sports and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The degree of neurological injury caused by subconcussive head trauma is not easily detectible, and this injury does not induce readily identifiable clinical signs or symptoms. Recent advancements in immunoassays make possible the detection and quantification of blood biomarkers linked to head trauma. Identification of a blood biomarker that can identify the extent of neurological injury associated with subconcussive head trauma may provide an objective measure for informed decisions concerning cumulative exposure to subconcussive head trauma. The purpose of the current study was to examine changes in the blood biomarkers of subconcussive head trauma over the course of an American football season. METHODS Thirty-five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) American football athletes underwent blood sampling throughout the course of a football season. Serial samples were obtained throughout the 2016 season, during which the number and magnitude of head impacts changed. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma concentrations of tau and serum concentrations of neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L). Athletes were grouped based on their starter status, because athletes identified as starters are known to sustain a greater number of impacts. Between-group differences and time-course differences were assessed. RESULTS In nonstarters, plasma concentrations of tau decreased over the course of the season, with lower values observed in starters; this resulted in a lower area under the curve (AUC) (starters: 416.78 ± 129.17 pg/ml/day; nonstarters: 520.84 ± 163.19 pg/ml/day; p = 0.050). Plasma concentrations of tau could not be used to discern between starters and nonstarters. In contrast, serum concentrations of NF-L increased throughout the season as head impacts accumulated, specifically in those athletes categorized as starters. The higher serum concentrations of NF-L observed in starters resulted in a larger AUC (starters: 1605.03 ± 655.09 pg/ml/day; nonstarters: 1067.29 ± 272.33 pg/ml/day; p = 0.007). The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses displayed fair to modest accuracy to identify athletes who were starters with the use of serum NF-L following periods of repetitive impacts. CONCLUSIONS The different patterns observed in serum NF-L and plasma tau concentrations provide preliminary evidence for the use of blood biomarkers to detect the neurological injury associated with repetitive subconcussive head trauma. Although further investigation is necessary, such findings might lay the foundation for the further development of an objective measure for the detection of neurological injury caused by subconcussive head trauma.","The paper investigates the fluctuations in blood biomarkers associated with subconcussive head trauma in NCAA football athletes over a season. It highlights the differential patterns of serum neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L) and plasma tau concentrations, suggesting that NF-L could serve as a potential objective measure for neurological injury linked to repetitive head impacts, particularly among starting players."
Countermovement Jump Recovery in Professional Soccer Players Using an Inertial Sensor,2018-05-29,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Malachy P. McHugh, Tom Clifford, Will Abbott, Susan Y. Kwiecien, Ian J. Kremenic, Joseph J. DeVita, Glyn Howatson","To assess the utility of an inertial sensor for assessing recovery in professional soccer players.In a randomized, crossover design, 11 professional soccer players wore shorts fitted with phase change material (PCM) cooling packs or uncooled packs (control) for 3 h after a 90-min match. Countermovement jump (CMJ) performance was assessed simultaneously with an inertial sensor and an optoelectric system: prematch and 12, 36, and 60 h postmatch. Inertial sensor metrics were flight height, jump height, low force, countermovement distance, force at low point, rate of eccentric force development, peak propulsive force, maximum power, and peak landing force. The only optoelectric metric was flight height. CMJ decrements and the effect of PCM cooling were assessed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Jump heights were also compared between devices.For the inertial sensor data, there were decrements in CMJ height on the days after matches (88% [10%] of baseline at 36 h, P = .012, effect size = 1.2, for control condition) and accelerated recovery with PCM cooling (105% [15%] of baseline at 36 h, P = .018 vs control, effect size = 1.1). Flight heights were strongly correlated between devices (r = .905, P < .001), but inertial sensor values were 1.8 [1.8] cm lower (P = .008). Low force during countermovement was increased (P = .031) and landing force was decreased (P = .043) after matches, but neither was affected by the PCM cooling intervention. Other CMJ metrics were unchanged after matches.This small portable inertial sensor provides a practical means of assessing recovery in soccer players.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of an inertial sensor in assessing recovery through countermovement jump (CMJ) performance in professional soccer players following matches. Key findings indicate that while CMJ height decreases post-match, recovery can be enhanced with phase change material cooling, and the inertial sensor is validated as a reliable tool for measuring these recovery metrics."

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Validated survey instrument. Subjects Seventy-two university soccer, hockey, and basketball athletes (28 males, 44 females). Main outcome measures Total athlete knowledge scores and attitude scores were measured and average scores were also determined for each sport, sex, and combinations of sport and sex. Results The average athlete knowledge total score was 28.9 ± 2.8 ( SD) out of a possible 35, and the average attitude total score was 76.4 ± 11.8 ( SD) out of a possible 98. Correlations between athlete knowledge scores and athlete attitude scores were positive in the all male athlete sample ( r = 0.09, n = 28, p = .65). The same correlation in the all female athlete sample was negative ( r = −.33, n = 44, p &lt; .05). Sixteen athletes suffered a total of 21 concussions in the 2015–2016 playing season. Conclusions The present sample of university athletes have higher knowledge scores but poorer attitude about concussions. Knowledge regarding concussion did not translate into improved attitudes particularly for female hockey athletes. Coaches should consider concussion education focused on communicating facts, as well as contextual interventions and practical athlete responses to injury. Interventions should consider the differences between male and female athlete reporting tendencies in this demographic. Appropriate detection and reporting systems may help to overcome poor reporting behaviors.","This paper investigates the knowledge and attitudes of university athletes towards sport-related concussions, highlighting a disconnect between high knowledge scores and poor attitude scores, particularly among female hockey athletes.

Head Impact Kinematics Estimation With Network of Inertial Measurement Units,2018-05-24,ASME International,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,"Calvin Kuo, Jake Sganga, Michael Fanton, David B. Camarillo","Wearable sensors embedded with inertial measurement units have become commonplace for the measurement of head impact biomechanics, but individual systems often suffer from a lack of measurement fidelity. While some researchers have focused on developing highly accurate, single sensor systems, we have taken a parallel approach in investigating optimal estimation techniques with multiple noisy sensors. In this work, we present a sensor network methodology that utilizes multiple skin patch sensors arranged on the head and combines their data to obtain a more accurate estimate than any individual sensor in the network. Our methodology visually localizes subject-specific sensor transformations, and based on rigid body assumptions, applies estimation algorithms to obtain a minimum mean squared error estimate. During mild soccer headers, individual skin patch sensors had over 100% error in peak angular velocity magnitude, angular acceleration magnitude, and linear acceleration magnitude. However, when properly networked using our visual localization and estimation methodology, we obtained kinematic estimates with median errors below 20%. While we demonstrate this methodology with skin patch sensors in mild soccer head impacts, the formulation can be generally applied to any dynamic scenario, such as measurement of cadaver head impact dynamics using arbitrarily placed sensors.","The paper presents a methodology for improving the estimation of head impact kinematics using a network of inertial measurement units (IMUs) positioned on the head. By addressing measurement fidelity issues with multiple sensors and employing visual localization and estimation algorithms, the research achieves significant reductions in kinematic estimation errors during mild soccer headers."
The impact of video speed on the decision-making process of sports officials,2018-05-23,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications,"Jochim Spitz, Pieter Moors, Johan Wagemans, Werner F. Helsen","There is an increasing trend in association football (soccer) to assist referees in their decision-making with video technology. For decisions such as whether a goal has been scored or which player actually committed a foul, video technology can provide more objective information and be valuable to increase decisional accuracy. It is unclear, however, to what extent video replays can aid referee decisions in the case of foul-play situations in which the decision is typically more ambiguous. In this study, we specifically evaluated the impact of slow-motion replays on decision-making by referees. To this end, elite referees of five different countries (n = 88) evaluated 60 different foul-play situations taken from international matches, replayed in either real time or slow motion. Our results revealed that referees penalized situations more severely in slow motion compared to real time (e.g. red card with a yellow card reference decision). Our results provide initial evidence that video replay speed can have an important impact on the disciplinary decision given by the referee in case of foul play. The study also provides a real-life test-case for theories and insights regarding causality perception.","The paper examines the influence of video speed on the decision-making process of sports officials, specifically elite referees in football.

"Use of inertial measurement units for measuring torso and pelvis orientation, and shoulder–pelvis separation angle in the discus throw",2018-05-22,SAGE Publications,International Journal of Sports Science &amp; Coaching,"Sara M Brice, Matthew Hurley, Elissa J Phillips","Wearable technologies, such as inertial measurement units, are being increasingly utilised in sport to provide immediate feedback to athletes and coaches on movement dynamics. This study examines the validity of inertial measurement units for measuring data pertinent to discus throwing namely shoulder–pelvis separation angle, and torso and pelvis transverse plane orientation. Five discus throwers performed 10 throws, while shoulder–pelvis separation angle, and torso and pelvis transverse plane orientation were measured simultaneously using a motion capture system and inertial measurement unit system. Time-series torso and pelvis orientation data were compared to determine the validity of the inertial measurement unit system for measuring the segment orientation. Discrete shoulder–pelvis separation angle data were compared to determine the validity of the inertial measurement unit system for measuring the discrete data pertinent to discus throwers and coaches. Discrete data examined were magnitudes of separation that occurred when the torso was maximally rotated to the left and right. Data were compared using root mean square difference and root mean square relative to angle range (RMS%). Bland–Altman analyses were also performed. Torso (RMS% = 3%) and pelvis (RMS% = 2%) orientation data agreed closely. Agreement was lower for separation angle (maximum left rotation RMS% = 9%; maximum right rotation RMS% = 13%). Bland–Altman biases indicate inertial measurement units underestimated segment orientation, underestimated maximum right rotation, and overestimated maximum left rotation. The protocol described was valid for measuring the torso and pelvis orientation. Separation angle validity was low, indicating differences in underlying modelling approaches. Further investigation is needed to examine more optimal sensor positioning, and novel ways of examining shoulder–pelvis dynamics.","This study investigates the effectiveness of inertial measurement units (IMUs) in measuring crucial parameters for discus throwing, specifically torso and pelvis orientation, and shoulder–pelvis separation angle. The findings indicate that while IMUs provide valid data for torso and pelvis orientation, their accuracy for shoulder–pelvis separation angle is lower, highlighting the need for further research on sensor placement and measurement techniques."
Strategies to improve impact efficiency in football kicking,2018-05-22,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"James C. A. Peacock, Kevin Ball","In football, kicking with high ball velocity can increase scoring opportunities and reduce the likelihood of interception. Efficient energy transfer from foot to ball during impact is important to attain a high ball velocity. It is considered impact efficiency can be increased by reducing the change in ankle plantarflexion during foot-ball impact. However, conflicting evidence exists, questioning its effectiveness as a coaching cue. The aim of the present study was to systematically analyse joint stiffness, foot velocity and impact location with a mechanical kicking machine to determine if change in ankle plantarflexion during foot-ball impact and ball velocity are influenced. Sagittal plane data of the shank, foot and ball were measured using high-speed video (4,000 Hz). Increasing joint stiffness reduced change in ankle plantarflexion and increased ball velocity from a greater effective mass. Increasing foot velocity increased change in ankle plantarflexion and increased ball velocity. Distal impact locations increased change in ankle plantarflexion and reduced ball velocity as coefficient of restitution decreased. These results identify that change in ankle plantarflexion is a dependent variable during foot-ball impact and does not directly influence ball velocity. Coaches can assess ankle motion during impact to provide feedback to athletes on their impact efficiency.","This paper investigates strategies to enhance impact efficiency in football kicking by examining the relationship between joint stiffness, foot velocity, and impact location on ball velocity during kicks. The findings reveal that while increased joint stiffness can improve ball velocity by reducing ankle plantarflexion changes, the alteration in ankle motion does not directly affect ball velocity, suggesting important considerations for coaching athletes on impact efficiency."
Muscle Activation During ACL Injury Risk Movements in Young Female Athletes: A Narrative Review,2018-05-15,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Jesper Bencke, Per Aagaard, Mette K. Zebis","Young, adolescent female athletes are at particular high risk of sustaining a non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during sport. Through the last decades much attention has been directed towards various anatomical and biomechanical risk factors for non-contact ACL injury, and important information have been retrieved about the influence of external loading factors on ACL injury risk during given sports-specific movements. However, much less attention has been given to the aspect of neuromuscular control during such movements and only sparse knowledge exists on the specific muscle activation patterns involved during specific risk conditions. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review was (1) to describe anatomical aspects, strength aspects and biomechanical aspects relevant for the understanding of ACL non-contact injury mechanisms in young female athletes, and (2) to review the existing literature on lower limb muscle activation in relation to risk of non-contact ACL-injury and prevention of ACL injury in young female athletes. Studies investigating muscle activity patterns associated with sports-specific risk situations were identified, comprising cohort studies, intervention studies and prospective studies. Based on the retrieved studies, clear gender-specific differences in muscle activation and coordination were identified demonstrating elevated quadriceps activity and reduced hamstring activity in young female athletes compared to their male counterparts, and suggesting young female athletes to be at elevated risk of non-contact ACL injury. Only few studies (n=6) examined the effect of preventive exercise-based intervention protocols on lower limb muscle activation during sports-specific movements. A general trend towards enhanced hamstring activation was observed during selected injury risk situations (e.g. sidecutting, drop landings). Only a single study examined the association between muscle activation deficits and ACL injury risk, reporting that low medial hamstring activation and high vastus lateralis activation prior to landing was associated with an elevated incidence of ACL-injury. A majority of studies were performed in adult female athletes. The striking paucity of studies in adolescent female athletes emphasizes the need for increased research activities to examine of lower limb muscle activity in relation to non-contact ACL injury in this high-risk athlete population.","This narrative review examines the anatomical, strength, and biomechanical factors contributing to the risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in young female athletes.

Objectives To compare the hip biomechanics, bony hip morphology associated with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, and hip strength and range of motion (ROM) between the symptomatic and asymptomatic limbs of sub-elite football players with unilateral hip-related groin pain and a positive flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) test. Methods Fifteen sub-elite football (soccer) players with unilateral hip-related groin pain and a positive FADIR test were recruited for this observational cross-sectional study. Three-dimensional motion analysis and ground reaction force data were recorded for walking and a single-leg drop-jump (SLDJ) task. Participants also underwent a standard anterior-posterior hip radiograph and hip strength and ROM assessment. Between-limb differences were assessed using paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results The symptomatic limb displayed a smaller peak hip extension angle (P = .01) and a lower peak hip adduction moment (P = .03) compared with the asymptomatic limb during the stance phase of walking. Additionally, during the SLDJ, the symptomatic limb demonstrated less total sagittal plane ROM (P = .04). The symptomatic limb also demonstrated less external rotation ROM (P = .03).

Relative risks were calculated, and presented with 90% confidence intervals, for the SIMS composite and individual subtest scores from generalized linear models with Poisson distribution offset for exposure. Results When considering noncontact time-loss lower extremity injuries (primary level of analysis), there was a most likely trivial association with the SIMS composite score. Similarly, the SIMS composite score demonstrated most likely to likely trivial associations with all injury categories included in the secondary level of analysis (noncontact time-loss hip/groin, thigh, knee, and ankle injuries).

Physical preparation of the football player with an intramuscular hamstring tendon tear: clinical perspective with video demonstrations,2018-05-03,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Matt Taberner, Daniel Dylan Cohen","Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) are common injuries in professional sport and the musculotendinous junction the most frequently injured site.1 2 MRI proves that the tendon extends into the muscle belly and has increased awareness of the intramuscular tendon injury.3 Some argue that this subtype of HSI may require surgical repair. Currently, there is no consensus on intramuscular tendon injury management; there is agreement that players are at an increased risk of re-injury on return to play (RTP).3 4 Evidence suggests that clinical decision-making, based on achieving functional goals, is an essential element of successful rehabilitation.4 

In this video-supported education review with a strong clinical slant, I outline the rehabilitation of an English Premier League footballer who suffered a proximal hamstring intramuscular tendon injury during competition.

Epidemiology of Hip and Groin Injuries in Collegiate Athletes in the United States,2018-05-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Yehuda E. Kerbel, Christopher M. Smith, John P. Prodromo, Michael I. Nzeogu, Mary K. Mulcahey","Background: Hip and groin pain is a common complaint among athletes. Few studies have examined the epidemiology of hip and groin injuries in collegiate athletes across multiple sports. Purpose: To describe the rates, mechanisms, sex-based differences, and severity of hip/groin injuries across 25 collegiate sports. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Data from the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years were obtained from the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA ISP). The rate of hip/groin injuries, mechanism of injury, time lost from competition, and need for surgery were calculated. Differences between sex-comparable sports were quantified using rate ratios (RRs) and injury proportion ratios (IPRs). Results: In total, 1984 hip/groin injuries were reported, giving an overall injury rate of 53.06 per 100,000 athlete-exposures (AEs). An adductor/groin tear was the most common injury, comprising 24.5% of all injuries. The sports with the highest rates of injuries per 100,000 AEs were men’s soccer (110.84), men’s ice hockey (104.90), and women’s ice hockey (76.88). In sex-comparable sports, men had a higher rate of injuries per 100,000 AEs compared with women (59.53 vs 42.27, respectively; RR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.28-1.55]). The most common injury mechanisms were noncontact (48.4% of all injuries) and overuse/gradual (20.4%). In sex-comparable sports, men had a greater proportion of injuries due to player contact than women (17.0% vs 3.6%, respectively; IPR, 4.80 [95% CI, 3.10-7.42]), while women had a greater proportion of injuries due to overuse/gradual than men (29.1% vs 16.7%, respectively; IPR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.46-2.06]). Overall, 39.3% of hip/groin injuries resulted in time lost from competition. Only 1.3% of injuries required surgery. Conclusion: Hip/groin injuries are most common in sports that involve kicking or skating and sudden changes in direction and speed. Most hip/groin injuries in collegiate athletes are noncontact and do not result in time lost from competition, and few require surgery. This information can help guide treatment and prevention measures to limit such injuries in male and female collegiate athletes.","The paper examines the epidemiology of hip and groin injuries among collegiate athletes in the United States, focusing on injury rates, mechanisms, and sex-based differences across 25 sports. The study reveals that hip/groin injuries are prevalent, particularly in men's soccer and ice hockey, with most injuries being noncontact and a low incidence of surgical interventions."

Study of the measurement and predictive validity of the Functional Movement Screen,2018-05-01,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Fraser Philp, Dimitra Blana, Edward K Chadwick, Caroline Stewart, Claire Stapleton, Kim Major, Anand D Pandyan","The aim of the study was to evaluate the reported measurement capabilities and predictive validity of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) for injury.This was a prospective observational longitudinal study of 24 male footballers from a single team in England, alongside analysis of an existing database over one season (September 2015-May 2016). A preseason FMS was carried out with scores recorded by an experienced assessor and derived, retrospectively, from the three-dimensional movement data that were simultaneously captured. The assessor scores were compared with the photogrammetric system to determine measurement validity, and predictive validity was quantified by assessing sensitivity and specificity (cut-off score of 14).The real-time assessor score matched the photogrammetric score awarded for one of the participants, was higher than the photogrammetric system for 22 participants and was lower than the photogrammetric system in 1 participant. There was no discernible relationship between FMS scores and the competencies required to be met as per the rules articulated for the allocation of a score. A higher number of total injuries were associated with higher FMS scores, whether determined through real-time assessment or codification of kinematic variables. Additionally, neither method of score determination was able to prospectively identify players at risk of serious injury.The FMS does not demonstrate the properties essential to be considered as a measurement scale and has neither measurement nor predictive validity. A possible reason for these observations could be the complexity in the instructions associated with the scale. Further work on eliminating redundancies and improving the measurement properties is recommended.","This study evaluates the measurement capabilities and predictive validity of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) for assessing injury risk in male footballers. The findings indicate that the FMS lacks the essential properties for a reliable measurement scale, as it does not effectively predict serious injuries and is hindered by complex instructions."
Dynamics of submaximal effort soccer instep kicking,2018-05-01,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Hiroyuki Nunome, Koichiro Inoue, Kohei Watanabe, Takahito Iga, Hiroshi Akima","During a soccer match, players are often required to control the ball velocity of a kick. However, little information is available for the fundamental qualities associated with kicking at various effort levels. We aimed to illustrate segmental dynamics of the kicking leg during soccer instep kicking at submaximal efforts. The instep kicking motion of eight experienced university soccer players (height: 172.4 ± 4.6 cm, mass: 63.3 ± 5.2 kg) at 50, 75 and 100% effort levels were recorded by a motion capture system (500 Hz), while resultant ball velocities were monitored using a pair of photocells. Between the three effort levels, kinetic adjustments were clearly identified in both proximal and distal segments with significantly different (large effect sizes) angular impulses due to resultant joint and interaction moments. Also, players tended to hit an off-centre point on the ball using a more medial contact point on the foot and with the foot in a less upright position in lower effort levels. These results suggested that players control their leg swing in a context of a proximal to distal segmental sequential system and add some fine-tuning of the resultant ball velocity by changing the manner of ball impact.","The paper investigates the dynamics of soccer instep kicking across different effort levels, focusing on how players adjust their kicking technique to control ball velocity. Using a motion capture system, it identifies significant kinetic adjustments in the leg's proximal and distal segments, as well as variations in foot placement and contact point with the ball at different effort levels."

In addition, inadequate body composition may impair performance. Objective: To assess body composition and hematological changes over a year in soccer players. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. Age, weight, height, body composition, blood count, serum iron, serum ferritin, serum transferrin and total iron binding capacity data were collected from the athletes’ medical records in the months of January, May and August of 2015 and January of 2016. Body mass index was also calculated. For the statistical analyses, the Anova and post-hoc Tukey’s post-hoc tests were used for the quantitative variables and the Chi-square test for the qualitative variables. The significance level adopted was p&lt;0.05. Results: Data were evaluated for 51 athletes with a mean age of 23.53 ± 3.11 years, 77.10 ± 6.56 kg, 1.80 ± 0.07 and 15.6 ± 2.89% body fat (BF). We observed significant (p&lt;0.05) changes in mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, cell size and eosinophils during the period evaluated. Among the athletes, 21.6% had decreased hematocrit levels and 3.9% had hemoglobin levels below the reference range.

Effect of Maturation on Heart Rate During a Six-Week Plyometric Training in Female Soccer Players,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Christina M. Mullen, Jeffrey B. Taylor, Michelle A. Aube, Audrey E. Westbrook, Anh-Dung Nguyen, James M. Smoliga, Kevin R. Ford","Implementation of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention program (IPP) has been recommended to coincide with the adolescent growth spurt as risk factors increase during and following this phase of maturation. Physiological responses to load during this stage of growth may result in a differing maximum heart rate (HRmax) during intense exercise. Understanding the relationship between physiological responses to load and maturation stage may result in more effective IPP in youth athletes. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of maturation on HRmax in adolescent soccer players over a six-week training program. METHODS: 34 female soccer players participated in a 6-week training study (age 13.3±1.5yrs; height 158.7±6.9cm; mass 50.0±9.6kg). Maturation groups were determined based on percent of adult stature (PAS) with 88-94% representing pubertal (n=9, PAS 91.6±2.0%) and 95-100% representing post-pubertal (n=25, PAS 97.7±1.7%). Three 30 minute sessions, separated into plyometric, resistance, and core strength training, were completed each visit for a total training time of 90 minutes three times per week. Participants wore HR monitors during each plyometric session. The initial exercises were adapted from ACL IPP, and intensity of each exercise was progressed weekly following the second week of training (5 total phases). HRmax was calculated for each participant during each session and averaged weekly. A linear mixed model (p<0.05) was used to determine the effects of HRmax over the six-week intervention in pubertal and post-pubertal female soccer players. Average HR during the first week of training was used as a covariate. RESULTS: A significant interaction of maturational group and training week was found (p<0.04) with HRmax. A main effect of training week was found in both pubertal (p<0.001) and post-pubertal (p<0.01) groups. HRmax was significantly increased in both groups (week 1 to week 3, p<0.05) following the first two technique focused weeks of plyometric program with the pubertal group (184.3±4.7 BPM) having greater HRmax compared to the post-pubertal group (172.7±2.2 BPM) during week 3. CONCLUSIONS: Physiologic responses to load was dependent on maturation stage and should be further examined in relation to reduced risk of injury following IPP.

A Novel Approach To Investigate Differences In Knee Mechanics After ACL Reconstruction Using Inertial Sensors,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Jasper Reenalda, Erik Maartens, Jaap Buurke, Mary Lloyd Ireland, Brian Noehren","Hop testing after an Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is a common functional test to determine return to play status. However, hop tests are not very sport specific, as they do not capture other tasks in sports like accelerating, decelerating, cutting and turning. A figure 8 running task is proposed as an alternative, involving these sport specific movements. Knee mechanics during this task can be objectified using inertial sensors. These sensors have been used previously to objectify hop tests and showed differences in knee kinematics in ACLR patients. PURPOSE: To investigate sagittal knee mechanics in ACLR patients during a 5 minute figure 8 running task, using inertial magnetic measurement units (IMUs). METHODS: 5 ACLR patients (2M 3F, 20.4 ± 2.1 yrs, 164.2 ± 10.7 cm, 69.1 ± 23.5 kg) one year post ACLR, and 10 healthy controls (7M 3F, 21.8 ± 2.0 yrs, 178.3± 10.2 cm, 73.5± 14.3 kg) performed a 5 minute figure 8 running task wearing a lycra suit equipped with 8 IMUs at the feet, tibia, upper legs, sacrum and sternum. Sagittal knee mechanics were determined at the straights since this is the most standardized part of the figure 8. The absolute difference in peak knee flexion (ADPK) during stance phase was determined between reconstructed and healthy leg for the ACLR group and between both legs for the healthy (HLTH) population. An independent Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for a statistical difference in ADPK between ACLR and HLTH. RESULTS: ADPK was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for the ACLR group versus the healthy population. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who have had an ACLR have a larger difference in peak knee flexion between their reconstructed and healthy leg (less flexion in the reconstructed knee) at the straights of a figure 8 Running task compared to healthy controls. The figure 8 test might serve as a new test to determine return to play and to assess re-injury risk. Future research should test this and include (frontal plane) knee mechanics during cutting and turning.Table 1: Peak knee flexion (degrees) of the reconstructed and healthy leg during stance phase of the individual ACLR subjects (ACLR#) and ACLR group and for the left and right leg for the HLTH group. An asterisk denotes the statistical significant difference.","This paper investigates sagittal knee mechanics in patients who have undergone Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction (ACLR) during a 5-minute figure 8 running task, using inertial magnetic measurement units (IMUs) to analyze knee flexion differences. The findings reveal that ACLR patients exhibit significantly less peak knee flexion in the reconstructed knee compared to healthy controls, suggesting the figure 8 task could be an effective assessment for return-to-play decisions and re-injury risk evaluation."
Biomechanical Evaluation Of Landing Maneuvers In Soccer Players With An Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Ahmad Alanazi, Katy Mitchell, Toni Roddey, Alexis Ortiz","Altered landing has been reported in individuals with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR). However, no study has evaluated landing biomechanics during soccer-specific landing tasks in soccer players with an ACLR. PURPOSE: To evaluate landing biomechanics in soccer players following ACLR during planned and unplanned landing tasks compared with healthy soccer players. METHODS: Eighteen soccer players with an ACLR (age, 26.11 ± 3.95 years; height, 1.70 ± 0.09 m; weight, 68.15 ± 9.64 kg, BMI, 23.52 ± 2.69 kg/m2, time since surgery, 5 ± 3.30 years) and 18 healthy soccer players (age, 25.83 ± 3.51 years; height, 1.66 ± 0.05 m; weight, 66.88 ± 10.37 kg, BMI, 24.09 ± 3.73 kg/m2) participated in the study. Planned landing included jumping forward and landing on the force plates, whereas unplanned landing included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force plates. Participants performed 4 trials of each landing task. The outcome measures were peak flexion angles and extension moments of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, peak pressure, and electromyography activity of gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles. A 2×2 ANOVA (landing × group) was performed for each measure. RESULTS: A significant landing × group interaction was found only for knee flexion angles (F1,34 = 11.26, p = 0.002). Follow-up comparisons showed that the ACL group landed with greater knee flexion during planned landing compared with unplanned landing (p < 0.001). Significant main effects of landing (regardless of group) were found. The unplanned landing showed decreased hip flexion (F1,34 = 48.55, p < 0.001), decreased knee flexion (F1,34 = 40.58, p < 0.001), decreased hip extension moments (F1,34 =6.82, p < 0.013), decreased knee extension moments (F1,34 = 27.18, p < 0.001), and decreased peak pressure (F1,34 = 20.98, p < 0.001). Also, a significant main effect for group (regardless of landing) for gastrocnemius muscle was found showing that the ACL group landed with reduced gastrocnemius activity (F1,34 = 11.27, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Unplanned landing showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with planned landing. The ACL group showed nearly similar landing biomechanics to the control group during both landing tasks. However, the ACL group used a protective landing strategy by reducing gastrocnemius activity.","The paper evaluates the landing biomechanics of soccer players who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) compared to healthy players during both planned and unplanned landing tasks. The findings indicate that while the ACL group generally exhibited similar landing biomechanics to the control group, they demonstrated a protective strategy by reducing gastrocnemius muscle activity, particularly during unplanned landings which were associated with increased injury risk."
The Preventive Effect Of A Bounding Exercise Programme On Hamstring Injuries In Amateur Male Soccer,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Sander van de Hoef, Michel Brink, Bionka Huisstede, Maarten van Smeden, Niels de Vries, Edwin Goedhart, Vincent Gouttebarge, Frank Backx","Hamstring injuries (HI) are the most common muscle injuries in both professional and amateur soccer. With the introduction of the effective Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), a decrease of hamstring injuries was expected. Nevertheless, an annual increase of HI is seen in the last decade. This might be due to poor compliance. Arguments for non- compliance are among others, that the NHE is not soccer-specific enough. Therefore, we developed the Bounding Exercise Programme (BEP) as an alternative. It is a sport- specific exercise programme which includes concentric, eccentric and plyometric exercises. PURPOSE: To determine the preventive effect of the Bounding Exercise Programme on hamstring injury occurrence in adult amateur male soccer players. METHODS: Soccer teams (N=32) competing on first class amateur level, were cluster-randomized to the intervention or control group. Both groups were instructed to perform their regular training programme, and the intervention group was also instructed to perform the BEP during the whole competition. At baseline, player characteristics were gathered from all participants. During the competition 2016-2017 all players weekly registered exposure (minutes) and HI occurrence. Compliance (meters of BEP) was reported by all players in the intervention group. RESULTS: 588 male soccer players (24,7 +/-4,5 yrs old) participated in this study. A total of 65 HI were reported within one competition. The overall HI incidence was 1,39 per 1000 soccer hours for the control group and 1,12 per 1000 soccer hours for the intervention group. Analysis of intention to treat showed no statistical significant difference between both groups in occurrence of HI (OR =0.89, 95% CI 0.459-1.747) and no significant difference in time to first HI (HR =0.90 ,CI = 0.478-1.695). There was also no effect found of adherence to BEP for the occurrence of HI and time to first HI. CONCLUSIONS:Our study showed no benefit of BEP over regular soccer on preventing HI in adult amateur soccer players. Compliance for BEP was moderate (on average 71%) This study was supported by a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development and the Royal Netherlands Football Association, was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of UMC Utrecht (16-332\C) and is registered in the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR6129).","The paper investigates the effectiveness of a sport-specific Bounding Exercise Programme (BEP) aimed at reducing hamstring injuries in amateur male soccer players.

Do Compression Socks Influence Muscle Activity of the Lower Extremities?,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,Andrew Craig-Jones,"Compression clothing is commonly worn by athletes and anecdotally believed to elicit beneficial responses both physiologically and biomechanically during a performance. PURPOSE: To determine if compression socks influence muscle activity of the lower extremities while running. A secondary purpose was to assess whether compression socks had an effect on heart rate (HR) or rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during running. METHODS: Recreational runners (n=5; 1.65 ± 0.07m; 67.48 ± 8.9kg; 21.8 ± 3.25yr) completed three running conditions: wearing graduated compression socks (CS), regular socks (RS), and placebo socks (PS). Each run was 10 minutes at a self-selected pace with speed controlled between conditions. CS were knee-high socks that had graduated compression moving proximally up the leg. Sock size used was based on shoe size as per manufacture instructions. RS were determined by the type of sock each subject was wearing on the day of testing. PS were regular soccer socks in which we fitted all subjects with L/XL to minimize any compression and instructed each subject they were a different brand of compression socks. Subjects were blind to conditions. HR was recorded during the last 30s of all trials telemetrically (Polar, Lake Success, NY). Muscle activity of the lower extremity was measured through electromyography (EMG; Delsys, Natick, MA). RPE was recorded at 3 minute intervals. EMG data were processed by removing any zero offset, rectifying, and averaging over 30 seconds of minutes 4, 7, and 10 of each trial. Dependent variables (EMG, HR, RPE) were each compared between conditions using repeated measure ANOVAs (α=0.05). RESULTS: HR and RPE were not significantly different between conditions (p>.05). Muscle activity for the Rectus Femoris (RF), Biceps Femoris (BF), and Gastrocnemius (GA) were not significantly different between conditions (p>.05). Muscle activity for the Tibialis Anterior (TA) was significantly different (p=0.042) during CS condition (47.8±2.2μv) compared to RS condition (63.0±2.0μv). This accounts for ~24% reduction in muscle activity while wearing compression socks. CONCLUSION: Compression socks significantly decrease muscle activity of the TA during running but had no effect on the RF, BF, or GA. Partial funding for this project was provided by NIH/NIDDK STEP-UP (R25DK078382).","This paper investigates the effects of compression socks on muscle activity in the lower extremities of recreational runners. The study finds that while compression socks significantly reduce activity in the Tibialis Anterior muscle, they have no substantial impact on muscle activity in the Rectus Femoris, Biceps Femoris, or Gastrocnemius, and do not affect heart rate or perceived exertion during running."
Focused Interventions for Special Populations,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,Jeffrey B. Taylor,"Anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programs (ACL-IPP) are generally successful at reducing injury rates; however, these ACL-IPP are more effective with women’s soccer (SOC) than basketball (BB) athletes. Purpose: To compare the biomechanical profiles and responses to an ACL-IPP in women’s BB and SOC players. Methods: 87 single- sport athletes (38 BB, 49 SOC) were cluster randomized into intervention (6-week ACL-IPP) and control groups. 3D biomechanical analyses of drop vertical jump (DVJ), double- (SAG-DL) and single-leg (SAG-SL) sagittal, and double- (FRONT-DL) and single-leg (FRONT-SL) frontal plane jump landing tasks were tested before and after the intervention. Baseline peak angles, excursions, and joint moments were analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA, while delta ([INCREMENT]) scores of the same biomechanical measures were analyzed using two-way MANCOVAs controlling for pre-test scores. Results: At baseline, BB players landed with less hip and/or knee excursion during all tasks (p<0.05) except for the SAG-SL task. The FRONT-SL task elicited the most distinct differences, including decreased hip adduction angles (mean difference: 5.0±1.3°, p<0.001), increased hip internal rotation excursion (mean difference: 2.8±0.9°, p=0.003), greater knee abduction moments (mean difference: 0.07±0.02 N[BULLET OPERATOR]m/kg[BULLET OPERATOR]m, p=0.003) and lower hip adduction moments (mean difference: 0.15±0.05 N[BULLET OPERATOR]m/kg[BULLET OPERATOR]m, p=0.001) in basketball players. After completing the ACL-IPP, the basketball intervention group exhibited a lower reduction in peak knee abduction angles ([INCREMENT]=0.9±3.5°) compared to the basketball control group ([INCREMENT]=2.6±3.0°, p=0.004) and soccer intervention group ([INCREMENT]=1.5±3.4°, p=0.01) during the SAG-SL. During FRONT-SL, the basketball intervention group exhibited greater knee flexion excursion ([INCREMENT]=1.5±4.5°) after training than the control group ([INCREMENT]=-1.8±5.5°, p=0.01). Conclusion: Soccer players exhibit a more protective landing strategy than basketball players, yet women’s basketball and soccer players largely exhibit similar biomechanical adaptations to ACL-IPP. These data indicate that ACL-IPP may need to account for sport-specific biomechanics, including technique training that emphasizes soft landings during basketball- specific frontal plane and single-leg jumping activities.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programs (ACL-IPP) in women’s soccer and basketball players, revealing that soccer players employ a more protective landing strategy. It highlights significant biomechanical differences between the two sports and suggests that ACL-IPP should consider sport-specific biomechanics for optimal effectiveness."
Countermovement Jump Kinetics and Performance Changes from 1st to 4th year in Division I Collegiate Athletes,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Demitra R. Philosophos, Jennifer L. Sanfilippo, Mikel R. Stiffler-Joachim, Bryan C. Heiderscheit, Daniel G. Cobian","The countermovement jump (CMJ) is a common test of athletic ability. Kinetic analysis indicates phase-specific CMJ ground reaction rate of force development (RFD) and rate of force unloading (RFU) are associated with jump performance. Collegiate athletes complete strength and conditioning regimens to maximize athletic ability and sports performance, but it is unclear what elements of the CMJ moderate these performance improvements. PURPOSE: To evaluate the changes in CMJ ground reaction force-time curve eccentric (ECC) and concentric (CONC) phase variables between the 1st and 4th year of participation in Division I collegiate athletics, and determine if and how these adaptations relate to changes in jump height. METHODS: 79 healthy NCAA Division I athletes (60 males) participating in football, soccer, basketball, hockey, and wrestling performed maximal CMJs on force plates (800 Hz) as part of standard yearly preseason evaluations. ECC and CONC phase force-time curve variables were computed, and Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks tests were used to evaluate changes in variables of interest between 1st and 4th year CMJ performance. Spearman’s correlation was used to evaluate associations between CMJ height and force-time curve variable differences. RESULTS: Jump height increased significantly (p < .001) from 1st to 4th year (38.3 ± 9.5 cm to 40.1 ± 9.1 cm), along with early phase (0-50%) ECC RFD (44.1 ± 37.6 N/s/kg to 55.1 ± 35.1 N/s/kg). Improved jump height was significantly associated with increased peak ECC RFD (rs = .274, p = .015), late phase (50-100%) ECC RFD (rs = .308, p = .006), and peak CONC RFU (rs = -.383, p < .001). Across the cohort, the force-time curve variable most strongly associated with CMJ height was peak CONC RFU (rs = -.560, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Improved CMJ performance is associated with increased ground reaction force ECC RFD and CONC RFU from 1st to 4th year of participation in Division I collegiate athletics. Our results suggest that CMJ height may be maximized by training to enhance the rate of unloading through rapid generation of hip, knee, and ankle extensor torque in combination with utilization of stored elastic energy.","The paper evaluates the changes in countermovement jump (CMJ) performance and its associated kinetic variables in Division I collegiate athletes from their first to fourth year. Key findings indicate significant improvements in jump height and specific ground reaction force variables, suggesting that enhanced CMJ performance can be achieved through targeted training that focuses on increasing rate of unloading and utilizing elastic energy."
An Evaluation of Star Excursion Balance Test In Identifying Athletes At Risk For Injury,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Mackenzie Pierson, Karlee Burns, Mimi Nakajima","PURPOSE: The use of the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is to screen deficits in dynamic postural control due to musculoskeletal injuries and to identify athletes at greater risk for lower extremity injury. However, the use of the SEBT has not proved reliably in female soccer populations in identifying potential lower extremity injury when assessed during pre-participation physical examinations. METHODS: 23 healthy NCAA Division I female soccer athletes; 20.3 (1.2) years, 165.1 (7.62) cm, 59.8 (8.6) kg, participated in this study. Prior to the start of the season, the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral SEBT reach distances were measured bilaterally. Each reach distances were normalized for lower limb length. Throughout the season, injury record was maintained by the certified athletic trainer. The athletes were grouped into injured (INJ) and non-injured (N-INJ) athletes. Composite scores for all three reach distances were also calculated. RESULTS: Independent t-test was conducted to compare reach distances for the SEBT between INJ and N-INJ athletes. There were no significant differences between the INJ and N-INJ group for normalized reach distances, nor composite scores of the SEBT. However, there was a significant difference in anterior reach asymmetries for those that sustained an injury (M= 6.06, SD=4.5); t(21)=2.78, p= 0.011) and those that did not sustain a lower extremity injury (M=2.5, SD=1.3). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the SEBT showed differences for lower extremity injury in the female soccer population when assessing the anterior asymmetries. Our results suggest that portions of the SEBT can be incorporated into pre-participation physical examinations to identify soccer athletes who may have a significant difference between limbs and potentially be at an increased risk for lower extremity injury.","The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) in identifying female soccer athletes at risk for lower extremity injuries. Although the SEBT did not show significant differences in reach distances between injured and non-injured athletes overall, notable asymmetries in anterior reach were observed in those who sustained injuries, suggesting that specific components of the SEBT could be valuable in pre-participation assessments."
Knee Joint-Specific Eccentric Utilization Ratio Determines Lower-Extremity Stretch-Shortening Cycle Function During Countermovement Jumps,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Jordi Heeneman, John Krzyszkowski, Kristof Kipp","The Eccentric Utilization Ratio (EUR) is an indicator of lower-extremity stretch-shortening cycle function in power athletes. Joint-specific EUR’s have not been established, and their contributions to whole-body EUR are currently not known. Determining joint-specific EUR’s and their contribution to whole-body EUR would help expand the understanding of the neuromuscular function and biomechanics of jumping exercises and provide insights for the program design process. PURPOSE: To determine joint-specific EURs and their associations with whole-body EUR. METHODS: Nine college track and field and soccer athletes (Height: 175 ± 15 cm, Weight: 71 ± 20 kg) participated in this study. All athletes performed three squat (SJ) and countermovement (CMJ) jumps. During all jumps, kinematic and kinetic data were obtained from 14 reflective markers (Plug-in-Gait marker set) and with two force plates, respectively. Hip, knee, and ankle joint powers of the right leg were calculated with inverse dynamics methods. In addition, jump heights were calculated from pelvis markers during each jump. EUR’s (CMJ/SJ [unitless]) were calculated from the three-trial average peak joint powers of the hip, knee, and ankle joint (joint-specific EUR) and from jump heights (whole-body EUR) of the CMJ and SJ. Joint-specific EUR’s were compared with a one- way ANOVA. Joint-specific EUR’s were then correlated to whole-body EUR with simple linear regressions. RESULTS: Joint-specific EUR’s were 1.04±0.18, 1.15±0.25, and 1.05±0.18 for the hip, knee, and ankle joint, respectively. Joint-specific EUR’s did not differ across joints. Whole-body EUR was 1.11±0.70. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between joint-specific EUR’s of the hip, knee, and ankle joint and whole-body EUR were 0.10 (p = 0.80), 0.70 (p = 0.01), and 0.50 (p = 0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The stretch-shortening cycle function of the knee joint appears to be the primary determinant of whole-body stretch-shortening cycle performance, while the ankle and hip joints do not appear to contribute much at all.","This paper investigates the influence of knee joint-specific Eccentric Utilization Ratios (EURs) on lower-extremity stretch-shortening cycle function during countermovement jumps in athletes. The findings indicate that the knee joint plays a significant role in whole-body EUR performance, while the contributions of the ankle and hip joints are minimal."
Knee Biomechanics in Division III Female Soccer Players with Reconstructed Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACLR),2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Marissa Guillou, Ana B. Freire Ribeiro","PURPOSE: To compare knee valgus angles (KVA) between healthy athletes and athletes with reconstructed ACLs in vertical drop jump and soccer specific drills. METHODS: Sixteen NCAA Division III (DIII) female soccer players, ages 20.94 (±1.29), thirteen athletes with healthy ACL and three with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Knee Valgus Angles (KVA) were measured during vertical drop jump, ladder drill, dribbling drill and shooting drill using Dartfish. Paired t-tests compared the groups. RESULTS: There were no differences in KVA between groups in any of the drills. Drop Jump KVA mean was 12.9± (SD±11.8)(p=0.87). Mean right leg KVA on ladder drill was 19.1±(SD±9.6)(p=0.95) and 17.2± (SD±8.3)(p=0.3) for left leg.

Validation of a Modified Functional Movement Screen Test for Division III Female Soccer Players,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Tiffany R. Widseth, Ana B. Freire Ribeiro","Background: The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is comprised of seven tests to identify compensatory movement patterns that may increase injury risk and reduce performance. A modified FMS (MFMS) was created by Augsburg Athletic Trainers to improve screening efficiency and includes three original FMS tests: shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability pushup, and a newly added test; the vertical drop jump (VDJ), all scored on a simplified 0-2 scale. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the MFMS for DIII female soccer players. METHODS: Sixteen NCAA DIII soccer players and twenty non-athlete controls were recruited and completed two trials of FMS and MFMS. Reliability was calculated as Pearson Product Moment. Concurrent validity was calculated between FMS and MFMS scores, using R Statistical Software. RESULTS: Mean age of soccer group was 21 (SD=1.37) and control 21.05 (SD=1.61). Mean FMS score for soccer group was 14.38 (SD=1.54) and control 13.35 (SD=2.39). Mean MFMS score for soccer was 5.62 (SD=0.96) and control 4.95 (SD=0.69). Soccer scores for the first MFMS trial were significantly larger than controls’ (p=0.02). FMS reliability coefficient was 0.99 and MFMS’ was 0.88. DISCUSSION: There were moderate positive correlations between FMS and MFMS for the soccer group (r=0.51) and for controls (r=0.46), but they were not large enough to validate the MFMS. When the MFMS was rescored on the original 0-3 scale (excluding VDJ) it was valid for both groups (soccer r = 0.79, controls r= 0.83). CONCLUSION: The MFMS is not valid, suggesting potential issues with the new scoring system. Keywords: Functional Movement Screen (FMS), validity, reliability, DIII Female soccer players","This paper validates a modified version of the Functional Movement Screen (MFMS) designed for Division III female soccer players, integrating an additional test—the vertical drop jump—into the traditional FMS structure. The findings indicate that while the MFMS demonstrated acceptable reliability, it ultimately lacked validity, particularly due to issues with the new scoring system, suggesting that the original FMS may be a more effective tool for assessing movement patterns in this demographic."
Pelvic Pain In A Soccer Player- Soccer,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"John T. Nelson, Delmas Bolin","HISTORY: A 23 year old men’s soccer player presented with left sided pubic bone pain for seventeen months. The injury occurred after collision with another player and falling onto his left side during a soccer game. He developed left sided pubic symphysis pain later that evening. He finished the season followed by complete inactivity for 2 months. At the start of the next season, the same left sided pain returned that was worse with initial steps, change of direction, and lateral movements. He was seen in a sports medicine clinic and had an MRI which showed edema in the rectus abdominis, left abductor, and pubic symphysis. He completed physical therapy with no improvement. He then developed intermittent sharp pain radiating to the left testicle with running, preventing return to play. Steroid and Platelet Rich Plasma injections did not alter symptoms. He was referred to General Surgery, Orthopedics, given NSAIDs, repeated PT, repeat MRI, and finally referred for a biomechanical evaluation and treatment. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pelvic compression test is + left. Palpation: left superior pubic rami pain; mild pain in left ischial tuberosity. ASIS to umbilicus measures 12 cm left, 13 cm right. ASIS is inferior on right. PSIS is superior on left. Left leg 1.5 cm shorter. Palpation of left lower abdominal quadrant lateral to the border of pubic symphysis reproduces left sided scrotal pain.

Modeling of ACL Injury Mechanism,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,Nathaniel A. Bates,"Invasive biomechanical techniques and the unpredictable nature of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury events limit direct in vivo investigations. Instead, researchers have developed in vitro models such as the mechanical impact simulator to recreate ACL injury events. Purpose: To quantify the biomechanical response of the ACL and medial collateral ligament (MCL) in a simulated landing environment capable of producing ACL ruptures consistent with clinical injury presentation. Methods: 39 cadaveric full lower extremity specimens (19M:20F) completed testing with impulse forces delivered to sole of the foot in the mechanical impact simulator. Pneumatic pistons mounted on the mechanical impact simulator generated knee abduction moments (KAM), internal tibial rotation moments (ITR), anterior tibial translation forces (ATS), hamstrings, and quadriceps forces <1 sec prior to impulse load delivery. KAM, ATS, and ITR magnitudes corresponded to in vivo recorded kinetics from athlete cohorts exhibiting high, medium, low, and no relative risk for ACL injury. Each kinetic input was independently randomized and a series of impulses was repeated on each specimen until hard or soft tissue failure occurred. ACL and MCL strains were recorded with implanted sensors, while a 6-axis load cell recorded forces and torques at the knee. Results: 87% of specimens produced ACL failures during simulation, with 92% presented at the femoral insertion or midsubstance and concomitant MCL failures in 31%. Peak strain was greater in the ACL (15.3 ± 8.7%) than the MCL (5.1 ± 6.3%; P < 0.01). Overall ACL strain across all external loading conditions was 3.5% greater in females than males (P = 0.04), but no sex differences were noted in the MCL (P = 0.36). Under identical external loading conditions, female specimens also exhibited larger KAM moments than males (P = 0.04). Conclusion: The mechanical impact simulator is the first in vitro model to reliably create ACL ruptures consistent with clinical presentation. Female specimens were more susceptible to ACL injury and KAM than males, which supports the established association between sex, KAM, and ACL injury risk. Future iterations of this model could be manipulated to investigate efficacy of injury prevention interventions and ACL reconstructions during simulated ACL injury events.","This paper focuses on modeling the mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries using an in vitro mechanical impact simulator. Key findings indicate that the simulator reliably recreates ACL ruptures consistent with clinical cases, revealing that female specimens are more susceptible to ACL injuries and associated knee abduction moments compared to males."
Effects of Lumbar Spine Position on Hamstring Flexibility During Passive Straight Leg Raise,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Kevin E. Finn, Andrew Cannon, Erica Campbell","The straight leg raise test and its variations are ubiquitous in clinical sports medicine practice to assess hamstring flexibility. According to the available literature, testing techniques such as the straight leg raise test may not provide an accurate measurement of hamstring flexibility due to the many confounding variables including lumbar spine motion, lumbar spine positioning and femoro-acetabular motion. PURPOSE: The current study contrasted the difference in the measurement of supine, passive straight leg raise with lumbar spine blocked in slight extension to replicate a neutral lumbar spine and normal contra-directional lumbo-pelvic rhythm and a non constrained lumbar spine during a passive straight leg raise via goniometric measurements of hamstring flexibility. METHODS: Utilizing 25 collegiate male and female cross country runners, goniometric measurements of the passive straight leg raise with and without a blocked lumbar spine were taken on both the right and left leg. RESULTS: A correlation between the average straight leg raise with and without at blocked lumbar spine was found to have a moderate to high correlation (r= 0.693, p value < .001). A dependent t-test revealed that that there was a significant difference between straight leg raise measurements with and without a blocked lumbar spine; M (SLR) =66.3, M (Blocked SLR) = 39.54, SD= 9.4418, t (24) =-14.71, p<.001. CONCLUSION: Maintaining neutral lumbar spine position, replicating normal contra-directional lumbo-pelvic rhythm during a passive straight leg raise significantly decreased goniometric measurements of hamstring flexibility. The results of this study indicate that consideration must be given to lumbar spine position and normal, functional, contra-directional lumbo-pelvic rhythm during the measurement of hamstring flexibility. Changes in testing procedures need to be made in the clinical setting to ensure that athletes are being correctly identified as demonstrating normal hamstring flexibility before being cleared to return to activity after hamstring injury.","This paper investigates the impact of lumbar spine position on hamstring flexibility during the passive straight leg raise test, a common assessment tool in sports medicine. The study finds that maintaining a neutral lumbar spine significantly affects goniometric measurements of hamstring flexibility, suggesting that adjustments to clinical testing procedures are necessary to accurately identify athletes’ recovery from hamstring injuries."
Impact Control in High-Intensity Interval Training Can Be Improved by Creatine Supplementation,2018-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Ana P. S. Azevedo, Fernanda M. Acquesta, Antonio H. Lancha, Romulo Bertuzzi, Jacques R. Poortmans, Hamilton Roschel, Alberto C. Amadio, Julio C. Serrão","High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an exercise mode designed to repeatedly stress the body with intense stimulus. Intense running can increase impact forces and alter muscle activation intensity. As skeletal muscles have an important role in shock attenuation, the depletion of muscle phosphorylcreatine (PCr) stores and the diminished energy sources could lead to exhaustion and impairments in the protective functions of muscle during running. We hypothesize creatine supplementation could avoid peripheral fatigue during intense exercise and reduce impairments on shock attenuation. PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of creatine supplementation on biomechanical parameters related to shock attenuation during a session of HIIT. METHODS: A single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design was adopted to test 8 elite soccer players (males; 16.3± 0.5 years; 70.7 ± 4.16 kg; 1.78± 0.06 m) during HITT sessions under two conditions: after placebo supplementation (Pl) and after creatine supplementation (Cr). HITT test sessions consisted of an intermittent test (5 bouts of running) with constant load applied until exhaustion was reached. The vertical component of Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) and Electromyography (EMG) data were recorded by Gaitway and Lynx-EMG Systems, respectively. Heart rate (HR), Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE – Borg’s Scale) and lactate concentration were also obtained. RESULTS: Creatine supplementation did not affect HR, RPE and lactate concentration. Decreased values (p<0.05) of magnitude of first peak (Fy1) of VGRF and impulse of first 50 ms (Imp50) were observed for Cr (about 16.2 – 24.2% and 34.3% of decrease, respectively), whereas higher values (p<0.05) of time to reach first peak (tFy1) were detected for Cr as compared to Pl (28.9 % of increase). Significant modifications (p<0.05) in muscle activation were also observed. Changes occurred in intermediary bouts, mainly in bout 2. CONCLUSION: Creatine supplementation has potential to influence biomechanical parameters related to impact control during a single session of HIIT based on running. Results indicate possible improvements in shock attenuation under creatine supplementation.",This paper investigates the effects of creatine supplementation on biomechanical parameters during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in elite soccer players. The findings suggest that creatine can enhance shock attenuation during intense running by reducing ground reaction forces and altering muscle activation patterns.
Interseason variability in isokinetic strength and poor correlation with Nordic hamstring eccentric strength in football players,2018-04-25,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"N. van Dyk, E. Witvrouw, R. Bahr","In elite sport, the use of strength testing to establish muscle function and performance is common. Traditionally, isokinetic strength tests have been used, measuring torque during concentric and eccentric muscle action. A device that measures eccentric hamstring muscle strength while performing the Nordic hamstring exercise is now also frequently used. The study aimed to investigate the variability of isokinetic muscle strength over time, for example, between seasons, and the relationship between isokinetic testing and the new Nordic hamstring exercise device. All teams (n = 18) eligible to compete in the premier football league in Qatar underwent a comprehensive strength assessment during their periodic health evaluation at Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in Qatar. Isokinetic strength was investigated for measurement error, and correlated to Nordic hamstring exercise strength. Of the 529 players included, 288 players had repeated tests with 1/2 seasons between test occasions. Variability (measurement error) between test occasions was substantial, as demonstrated by the measurement error (approximately 25 Nm, 15%), whether separated by 1 or 2 seasons. Considering hamstring injuries, the same pattern was observed among injured (n = 60) and uninjured (n = 228) players. A poor correlation (r = .35) was observed between peak isokinetic hamstring eccentric torque and Nordic hamstring exercise peak force. The strength imbalance between limbs calculated for both test modes was not correlated (r = .037). There is substantial intraindividual variability in all isokinetic test measures, whether separated by 1 or 2 seasons, irrespective of injury. Also, eccentric hamstring strength and limb-to-limb imbalance were poorly correlated between the isokinetic and Nordic hamstring exercise tests.","The paper investigates the variability of isokinetic muscle strength in elite football players over different seasons and assesses the correlation between isokinetic testing and the Nordic hamstring exercise device. Key findings indicate significant intraindividual variability in isokinetic strength measures and a poor correlation between peak eccentric torque and Nordic hamstring exercise strength, suggesting limitations in current strength testing methods in relation to hamstring injury assessment."
"Brain Motion, Deformation, and Potential Injury During Soccer Heading",2018-04-25,Gavin Publishers,Sports Injuries &amp; Medicine,Charles F Babbs,"This paper addresses the problem of what is happening physically inside the skull during head-ball contact.Mathematical models based upon Newton's laws of motion and numerical methods are used to create animations of brain motion and deformation inside the skull.Initially a 1 cm gap filled with Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) separates the brain from the rigid skull in adults and older children.Whole head acceleration induces a pulse of artificial gravity within the skull.Because brain density differs slightly from that of CSF, the brain accelerates and strikes the inner aspect of the skull, undergoing viscoelastic deformation, ranging from 1 to 2 percent compression for normal heading with good technique, from 5 to 10 percent compression for normal heading with poor technique, and from 30 to 40 percent compression for accidental heading of rising balls at close range.The amount of local strain developed at the point of impact is magnified by force concentration caused by the mismatch between curvature of the brain and curvature of the overlying skull.Computed values are compared to a putative safe level of 1% maximum compressive strain permitted by the skull anatomy of woodpeckers.This fresh biomechanical analysis allows one to visualize events within the skull during soccer heading.The results suggest heading safety is greatly improved when players head the ball with greater effective body mass, which is determined by a player's size, strength, and technique.Focus on teaching proper technique, re-design of age-appropriate balls with reduced weight, and strict avoidance of head contact with fast, rising balls kicked at close range can substantially reduce the risk of subtle brain injury.","This paper investigates the internal mechanics of the skull and brain during soccer heading, utilizing mathematical models to simulate brain motion and deformation upon impact. Key findings highlight the variances in brain compression based on heading technique and the implications for player safety, emphasizing the importance of proper heading technique and potential modifications to the soccer ball to mitigate injury risks."
Detection of Persisting Concussion Effects on Neuromechanical Responsiveness,2018-04-23,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"GARY B. WILKERSON, DUSTIN C. NABHAN, CHAD J. PRUSMACK, WILLIAM J.

A whole-body reactive agility (WBRA) test requiring side-shuffle movements in response to visual targets was used to assess reaction time, speed, acceleration, and deceleration.Concussion occurrence at 2.0 ± 2.3 yr before testing was reported by 21 athletes. Strong univariable associations were found for VMRT+FT left minus right difference ≥15 ms (odds ratio [OR], 7.14), VMRT+ST outer two-ring to inner three-ring ratio ≥1.28 (OR, 4.58), and WBRA speed asymmetry ≥7.7% (OR, 4.67).

Using the Disclosure Decision-Making Model to Understand High School Football Players’ Disclosures of Concussion Symptoms,2018-04-20,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sport Communication,"Gregory A. Cranmer, Sara LaBelle","Despite advancements in concussion treatment and management, health and sports professionals largely depend on athletes’ self-reporting of symptoms to begin the process of diagnosis. With this in mind, recent scholarly attention has focused on understanding the barriers and processes of athletes’ self-disclosure of symptoms. The current study applied the disclosure decision-making model to understand high school football players’ disclosure decisions after experiencing symptoms of a concussion. Data obtained from 184 high school football players from across the United States demonstrated 2 significant paths by which players’ disclosures of concussion symptoms during a game can be understood. First, the perceived severity of these symptoms predicted athletes’ self-efficacy to disclose concussions, which subsequently predicted their intentions to disclose concussion symptoms during a game. Second, the felt stigma around disclosing concussion symptoms predicted athletes’ anticipated responses from coaches to such disclosures, which subsequently predicted their intentions to disclose concussion symptoms during a game. Furthermore, the effect of perceived stigma on the anticipated responses from coaches was moderated by the quality of athletes’ relationships with their coaches. These results highlight the importance of convincing athletes to take concussion symptoms seriously and the role of athlete–coach relationships in combatting stigma around concussion disclosures. These findings suggest that scholars and practitioners should acknowledge the social contexts surrounding disclosure of concussion symptom and shift educational efforts to focus on the dangers of concussions and the process by which athletes should report potential symptoms.","The paper examines the factors influencing high school football players' disclosure of concussion symptoms, applying the disclosure decision-making model to analyze their decisions. It identifies two main pathways: the impact of symptom severity on self-efficacy and intentions to disclose, and the role of perceived stigma and athlete-coach relationships in influencing disclosure intentions."

This narrative review aims to explain the mechanisms that underlie the occurrence of sports injuries, and an innovative approach for their prevention on the basis of complex dynamic systems approach. First, we explain the multilevel organisation of living systems and how function of the musculoskeletal system may be impaired. Second, we use both, a constraints approach and a connectivity hypothesis to explain why and how the susceptibility to sports injuries may suddenly increase. Constraints acting at multiple levels and timescales replace the static and linear concept of risk factors, and the connectivity hypothesis brings an understanding of how the accumulation of microinjuries creates a macroscopic non-linear effect, that is, how a common motor action may trigger a severe injury. Finally, a recap of practical examples and challenges for the future illustrates how the complex dynamic systems standpoint, changing the way of thinking about sports injuries, offers innovative ideas for improving sports injury prevention.","This paper reviews the mechanisms underlying sports injuries and proposes a complex dynamic systems approach for their prevention. It emphasizes the multilevel organization of living systems, highlighting how constraints and connectivity among microinjuries can lead to significant injury risk, ultimately suggesting new strategies for injury prevention in sports."
Is the message getting through? Awareness and use of the 11+ injury prevention programme in amateur level football clubs,2018-04-19,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Jan Wilke, Daniel Niederer, Lutz Vogt, Winfried Banzer","A large body of evidence suggests that the 11+ warm-up programme is effective in preventing football-related musculoskeletal injuries. However, despite considerable efforts to promote and disseminate the programme, it is unclear as to whether team head coaches are familiar with the 11+ and how they rate its feasibility. The present study aimed to gather information on awareness and usage among German amateur level football coaches. A questionnaire was administered to 7893 individuals who were in charge of youth and adult non-professional teams. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the obtained data. A total of 1223 coaches (16%) returned the questionnaire. There was no risk of a non-response bias (p>.05). At the time of the survey, nearly half of the participants (42.6%) knew the 11+. Among the coaches who were familiar with the programme, three of four reported applying it regularly (at least once per week). Holding a license (φ = .28, p < .0001), high competitive level (Cramer-V = .13, p = .007), and coaching a youth team (φ = .1, p = .001) were associated with usage of 11+. Feasibility and suitability of the 11+ were rated similarly by aware and unaware coaches. Although a substantial share of German amateur level coaches is familiar with the 11+, more than half of the surveyed participants did not know the programme. As the non-usage does not appear to stem from a lack of rated feasibility and suitability, existing communication strategies might need to be revised.","The paper investigates the awareness and application of the 11+ injury prevention programme among amateur football coaches in Germany, highlighting that only 42.6% of surveyed coaches were familiar with the programme despite its proven effectiveness in reducing injuries.

A biomechanical comparison of dominant and non-dominant limbs during a side-step cutting task,2018-04-19,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Christine D. Pollard, Marc F. Norcross, Sam T. Johnson, Amanda E. Stone, Eunwook Chang, Mark A. Hoffman","Numerous studies have investigated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk by examining gender differences in knee and hip biomechanics during a side-step cutting manoeuvre since it is known that ACL injury often occurs during such a task. Recent investigations have also examined lower extremity (LE) biomechanics during side-step cutting in individuals following ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Common research practice is to compare knee and hip biomechanics of the dominant limb between groups but this can add considerable complexity for clinicians and researchers. At this time, it is not known if there is a difference in LE biomechanics between the dominant and non-dominant limb during side-step cutting. Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were collected while 31 healthy participants performed five, side-step cutting manoeuvres with the dominant and non-dominant limbs. Knee and hip variables examined are those commonly investigated in ACL injury literature. There were no differences between limbs in all but one variable (knee internal rotation). These results demonstrate that healthy individuals exhibit little side-to-side differences in certain LE biomechanics when performing a side-step cutting manoeuvre. These findings can be utilised by clinicians when conducting dynamic evaluations of their ACLR patients and when developing injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes.","This paper examines the biomechanical differences between dominant and non-dominant limbs during a side-step cutting maneuver, focusing on the implications for ACL injury risk. The study found minimal differences in lower extremity biomechanics between limbs in healthy individuals, suggesting uniformity in knee and hip kinematics, except for one variable, which may inform clinicians in evaluating and rehabilitating ACL reconstruction patients."

During SAG-SL the basketball intervention group exhibited increased peak knee abduction angles (p = .004) and excursions (p = .003) compared to the basketball control group (p = .01) and soccer intervention group (p = .01). During FRONT-SL, the basketball intervention group exhibited greater knee flexion excursion after training than the control group (p = .01), but not the soccer intervention group (p = .11). Although women's soccer players exhibit greater improvements in knee abduction kinematics than basketball players, these athletes largely exhibit similar biomechanical adaptations to ACL injury prevention programmes.","The paper investigates the biomechanical responses of basketball and soccer players to an ACL injury prevention programme through a randomised controlled trial. It finds that while both groups experience biomechanical adaptations after the intervention, soccer players show greater improvements in knee abduction kinematics compared to basketball players, highlighting sport-specific differences in response to such programmes."

Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Trochlea: A Cohort Study of 34 Trochlear Lesions Associated With Sporting Activities That Load the Patellofemoral Joint,2018-04-17,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics,"Meghan J. Price, Maria Tuca, Joseph Nguyen, Jason Silberman, Eva Luderowski, Tyler J. Uppstrom, Daniel W. Green","Background: Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (JOCD) lesions are rarely located in the trochlea and few studies have focused on the causes and outcomes of JOCD lesions in this part of the knee. The purpose of this study is to (1) evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who undergo surgery for JOCD in this unusual location as well as (2) assess the association between trochlear JOCD and participation in sporting activities that load the patellofemoral joint. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 34 trochlear JOCD lesions in 30 patients. Cases that involved traumatic cartilage shear or patella instability were excluded. Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance images and x-rays were evaluated and demographic data, sports played, comorbidities, surgical procedures, and clinical data were extracted from medical records. A case-control cohort of 102 femoral condyle lesions was used to assess the correlation between sports played and lesion location. Results: The cohort comprised 34 consecutive trochlear JOCD lesions in 30 patients (26 males, 4 females). Average age at surgery was 13.8 years (9.3 to 18.0 y). In total, 27 (90%) patients were active, and of these active patients, soccer and basketball were the most common sports played. In the case-control comparison, the correlation between playing either basketball or soccer and the presence of a trochlear JOCD lesion was statistically significant ( P =0.017). In total, 21 knees (62%) received operative treatment. Sixteen of the surgical patients underwent repair and fixation with bioabsorbable nails. The average length of clinical and radiographic follow-up was 21.1 months. All patients who underwent fixation showed radiographic and/or clinical indications of healing at most recent follow-up. Thirteen of the patients who underwent fixation were active, and all of these patients reported successful return to sports. Thirteen knees underwent nonoperative treatment, and the majority of these patients had limited follow-up. Conclusions: We report a significant association between pediatric athletes who play basketball and soccer and the development of trochlear JOCD, suggesting that repetitive loading of the patellofemoral joint may play a role in the development of JOCD lesions. Patients with trochlear JOCD lesions were likely to undergo surgery, and repair and fixation of the lesions produced good outcomes at short-term follow-up. Level of Evidence: Level III—case-control study.","This study investigates juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (JOCD) lesions located in the trochlea, focusing on their clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes in relation to sporting activities, particularly soccer and basketball. The findings reveal a significant correlation between participation in these sports and the development of trochlear JOCD, with most patients experiencing successful treatment outcomes."
Goalkeeping in the soccer penalty kick,2018-04-16,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research,"John van der Kamp, Matt Dicks, Jose Antonio Navia, Benjamin Noël","The goalkeeper's difficulty in the soccer penalty kick originates from the extreme spatiotemporal constraints of the situation. The present review claims that the current understanding is biased toward attributing a goalkeeper's success in saving a penalty kick to perceptual–cognitive skill. To investigate the goalkeeper's skill, researchers have often adopted video tasks. In doing so, they studied perceptual skill in isolation from action. We use affordance-based control theory to propose an alternative understanding and research methodology. We argue that goalkeepers in the penalty kick situation should regulate their actions in ways that sustain the perception of stoppability. To capture this, we outline the building blocks for a required lateral velocity model, in which the goalkeepers' required actions are scaled to their maximum capabilities. In doing so, we provide new directions for research.","This paper reviews the challenges faced by goalkeepers during soccer penalty kicks, emphasizing the limitations of current research that focuses primarily on perceptual–cognitive skills. It proposes an affordance-based control theory as an alternative framework for understanding goalkeeper actions, suggesting the need for a lateral velocity model to better align their actions with their physical capabilities."

Effects of different footwear properties and surface instability on neuromuscular activity and kinematics during jumping. J Strength Cond Res 32(11): 3246-3257, 2018-The purpose of this study was to examine sex-specific effects of different footwear properties vs. barefoot condition during the performance of drop jumps (DJs) on stable and unstable surfaces on measures of jump performance, electromyographic (EMG) activity, and knee joint kinematics. Drop jump performance, EMG activity of lower-extremity muscles, as well as sagittal and frontal knee joint kinematics were tested in 28 healthy male (n = 14) and female (n = 14) physically active sports science students (23 ± 2 years) during the performance of DJs on stable and unstable surfaces using different footwear properties (elastic vs. minimal shoes) vs. barefoot condition. Analysis revealed a significantly lower jump height and performance index (Δ7-12%; p < 0.001; 2.22 ≤ d = 2.90) during DJs on unstable compared with stable surfaces. This was accompanied by lower thigh/shank muscle activities (Δ11-28%; p < 0.05; 0.99 ≤ d = 2.16) and knee flexion angles (Δ5-8%; p < 0.05; 1.02 ≤ d = 2.09). Furthermore, knee valgus angles during DJs were significantly lower when wearing shoes compared with barefoot condition (Δ22-32%; p < 0.01; 1.38 ≤ d = 3.31). Sex-specific analyses indicated higher knee flexion angles in females compared with males during DJs, irrespective of the examined surface and footwear conditions (Δ29%; p < 0.05; d = 0.92). Finally, hardly any significant footwear-surface interactions were detected. Our findings revealed that surface instability had an impact on DJ performance, thigh/shank muscle activity, and knee joint kinematics. In addition, the single factors ""footwear"" and ""sex"" modulated knee joint kinematics during DJs. However, hardly any significant interaction effects were found. Thus, additional footwear-related effects can be neglected when performing DJs during training on different surfaces.","This study investigates the effects of different footwear properties and surface stability on neuromuscular activity and knee joint kinematics during drop jumps. Key findings indicate that unstable surfaces lead to lower jump performance and muscle activity, with sex-specific differences in knee flexion angles, while emphasizing minimal footwear impact during such jumps."

Three groups of professional and junior elite soccer players were investigated: a PRO group (n = 52), a U-21 group (n = 55), and a U-19 group (n = 47). The study of body balance control was performed using a Delos Postural Proprioceptive System measurement tool. The analysis of the results showed an effect of group (p < 0.01) and leg significance (p < 0.95) in the dynamic test. Three-way analysis of variance (3 [group] × 2 [leg] × 2 [eyes]) of static test data showed that the main effect of eyes (p < 0.0001), group (p < 0.0001), and leg (p = 0.0092) and the 2-way interaction of eyes × group (p = 0.0003) were significant. To represent statistical significance, the cutoff value was set to be p ≤ 0.005 for all measures. Our results indicate the importance of evaluation and monitoring of dynamic and static balance on both legs, which allows for a comprehensive comparison of body balance control and the balance recovery strategy depending on the represented sport level. Our study indicates that the higher the sport level of football players (the PRO group), the better their balance, which may indirectly contribute to the prevention of injuries and more effective performance of any actions directly related to the game.","This study investigates the differences in static and dynamic balance control among professional and junior elite soccer players, utilizing the Delos Postural Proprioceptive System. The findings suggest that higher levels of competition correlate with improved balance capabilities, emphasizing the need for evaluating balance strategies to potentially enhance performance and reduce injury risk in football."
On using wearable tri-axial accelerometers to examine the striking phase kinematics of expert specialist drag flickers on-field,2018-04-12,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Simon M. Rosalie, Weng I. Tang, Andrew S. McIntyre, Stacey Stockman, Craig King, Cameron Watkins, Catherine Yvette Wild, Leo Ng","Analysing player kinematics during a match using ""gold-standard"" 3D video-based motion analysis techniques is a difficult prospect indeed. The development of small, wireless, wearable sensors offers the potential to reduce the challenges of measuring kinematics during match-play without hindering performance. The present study examined the viability of using wireless tri-axial accelerometers to examine whether key performance measures of drag flicks executed by expert specialist drag-flickers are predicted by the kinematics of the striking phase. Linear mixed models were used to examine whether the speed and accuracy of players' drag flicks were predicted by the duration of stick-ball contact, and the kinematics of the lead lower limb at stick-ball contact and ball release. Results revealed that stick and lead lower limb kinematics significantly predicted shot accuracy but not shot speed. Shorter drag-time predicted more accurate flicks (p = 0.03) as did a more vertical leg at stick-ball contact (p = 0.016) and a more horizontal thigh at ball release (p = 0.001). This may indicate that there are more ways to produce fast drag flicks than accurate ones. This study illustrates that wireless tri-axial accelerometers can be used on-field to measure the effects of kinematics on key performance measures.","This paper investigates the use of wearable tri-axial accelerometers to analyze the striking phase kinematics of expert drag flickers during field hockey matches. It demonstrates that certain kinematic factors, such as stick-ball contact duration and lead lower limb positioning, significantly influence shot accuracy, while also highlighting the feasibility of using wireless sensors for on-field performance measurements."

Does variability within natural turfgrass sports fields influence ground‐derived injuries?,2018-04-03,Wiley,European Journal of Sport Science,"Chase M. Straw, Christine O. Samson, Gerald M. Henry, Cathleen N. Brown","Natural turfgrass sports fields exhibit within-field variations due to climatic conditions, field construction, field management, and foot traffic patterns from field usage. Variations within a field could influence the playing surface predictability and require athletes to make abrupt or frequent adjustments that lead to increased ground-derived injury occurrence. This study introduces a new methodology aimed at evaluating the potential relationship between within-field variations of turfgrass sports field properties and ground-derived athlete injuries. Collegiate Club Sport athletes self-reported ground-derived injuries over two years. Soil moisture, turfgrass quality, surface hardness, and turfgrass shear strength were quantified from their two home fields. Hot spot analysis identified significantly high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) values within the fields. Injury locations were compared to hot spot maps each month. Binomial proportion tests determined if there were differences between observed injury proportions and expected proportions. Twenty-three ground-derived injuries were reported overall. The observed injury proportions occurring in turfgrass quality cold spots [0.52 (95% CI 0.29-0.76)] and soil moisture hot spots [0.43 (95% CI 0.22-0.66)] was significantly higher than expected [0.20 (p < .001) and 0.21 (p < .05), respectively]. Most injuries in significant areas of turfgrass quality, soil moisture, and surface hardness were along edges of hot and cold spots. These results suggest a potential relationship between within-field variations and ground-derived injuries, particularly in transition areas between non-significant and significant high and low values. Future larger-scale studies can incorporate the reported methodology to validate this relationship and implement strategies that reduce ground-derived injuries.","This paper investigates the impact of variations in natural turfgrass sports fields on the occurrence of ground-derived injuries in athletes. It presents a novel methodology for assessing the relationship between turfgrass properties, such as soil moisture and quality, and injury rates, finding significant injury proportions in specific field areas related to these variations."

Collin Herb, Kaitlyn Grossman, Mark A. Feger, Luke Donovan, Jay Hertel","Context: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a condition characterized by range-of-motion, neuromuscular, and postural-control deficits and subjective disability, reinjury, and posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Differences have been reported in kinematics, kinetics, surface electromyography (EMG), and ground reaction forces during functional tasks performed by those with CAI. These measures are often collected independently, and the research on collecting measures simultaneously during a movement task is limited. Objective: To assess the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity, vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), and EMG of 4 shank muscles during a drop–vertical-jump (DVJ) task. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Motion-capture laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Forty-seven young, active adults in either the CAI (n = 24) or control (n = 23) group. Intervention(s): Three-dimensional motion capture was performed using an electromagnetic motion-capture system. Lower extremity kinematics, frontal- and sagittal-plane kinetics, vGRF, and EMG of the shank musculature were collected while participants performed 10 DVJs. Main Outcome Measure(s): Means and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for all measures from 100 milliseconds before to 200 milliseconds after force-plate contact. Results: Patients with CAI had greater inversion from 107 to 200 milliseconds postcontact (difference = 4.01° ± 2.55°), smaller plantar-flexion kinematics from 11 to 71 milliseconds postcontact (difference = 5.33° ± 2.02°), greater ankle sagittal-plane kinetics from 11 to 77 milliseconds postcontact (difference = 0.17 ± 0.09 Nm/kg) and from 107 to 200 milliseconds postcontact (difference = 0.23 ± 0.03 Nm/kg), and smaller knee sagittal-plane kinematics from 95 to 200 milliseconds postcontact (difference = 8.23° ± 0.97°) than control participants after landing.

Tjong","The chop block, a football maneuver in which an offensive player blocks an opponent around the thigh while another offensive player engages the same opponent above the waist, was declared illegal by the National Football League (NFL) before the 2016-2017 season. Chop blocks have been hypothesized to be associated with medial collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament injury, especially in offensive/defensive linemen.To quantify the impact that the chop-block rule change had on the incidence of knee injuries to defensive players in the NFL over 4 seasons (2014-2018).Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.NFL injury data for all defensive players from regular-season games played from 2014 through 2018 were collected. For this study, all knee injuries were attributed to competitive game play. Injury rates were reported as the number of injuries per 1000 athletic exposures (with 95% CIs).A total of 256 games were played during the 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 NFL regular seasons, and all were included in this study. Among defensive players, the relative risk for a knee injury per 1000 athletic exposures was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75-0.96) for the 2 seasons after the chop-block rule change (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) versus the 2 seasons before (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) (P = .009). Thus, the relative risk reduction was 16%. The relative risk for a defensive player to be placed on injured reserve per season was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.72-1.13) for the 2 seasons after the rule change versus the 2 seasons before (P = .39).The NFL's recent ruling against in-game chop blocks may have reduced the incidence of knee injuries among defensive players.",The paper investigates the impact of the NFL's illegalization of chop blocks on the incidence of knee injuries in defensive players over four seasons. Findings suggest that the rule change was associated with a 16% reduction in the relative risk of knee injuries during gameplay.
Restrictions in the Ankle Sagittal- and Frontal-Plane Range of Movement during Simulated Walking with Different Types of Orthoses,2018-04-01,MDPI AG,Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology,"Frank Thiele, Sebastian Schuhmacher, Christoph Schwaller, Stefan Plüss, Joël Rhiner, Renate List, Silvio Lorenzetti","Different types of orthoses are available to clinicians for non-surgical treatment of acute ankle sprains. The goal of this study was to scientifically compare the movement restrictions in the sagittal and frontal plane during simulated walking between one adaptable semi-rigid brace (OrthoTri-PhaseTM), four non-adaptable semi-rigid braces (OrthoStandardTM, MalleoLocTM, MalleoSprintTM, VACOankleTM), and one rigid cast. Predefined time sequences of rotational moments and axial loading during gait were applied via an ankle joint simulator, with the pneumatic pressure inside the orthoses kept constant to ensure the same condition for different trials and orthoses. The peak ranges of motion (RoMs) in the frontal and sagittal plane during gait were analyzed for statistically significant differences using single-factorial ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni analysis. Significant differences in peak plantar-/dorsiflexion and in-/eversion RoM during gait were found between different types of orthoses. In the sagittal plane, the rigid cast most significantly restricted overall RoM followed by the Ortho Tri-PhaseTM in Phase 1 and the Ortho StandardTM. The peak restriction in-/eversion RoM of the VACOankleTM came closest to the rigid cast, with a shift towards inversion. The VACOankleTM allowed for significantly larger dorsiflexion movement compared to all other orthoses. The present results may help clinicians in the decision-making process of finding the optimal orthosis for individual patients.","This study compares the movement restrictions caused by various orthoses during simulated walking, focusing on sagittal and frontal plane range of motion (RoM) after acute ankle sprains. The findings indicate significant differences in peak RoM among the tested orthoses, with the rigid cast exhibiting the most substantial restrictions, which may inform clinicians in selecting the most suitable orthotic devices for patients."

Design A cross‐sectional study secondary level of care. Methods Sample from an elite soccer academy in Madrid (Spain) 35 healthy male subjects (youth soccer players) age 12.82 ± 1.07 years, height 158.68 ± 10.79 cm, weight 49.19 ± 9.45 kg, body mass index 19.41 ± 2.25. The exclusion criteria were the presence of musculoskeletal and joint injuries, pelvic pain, ankle sprains, low back pain and use of drugs in the previous week, and scoliosis. Results Temperature value for gastrocnemius muscles and Achilles tendon were assessed in 35 youth soccer players from an academia before and after training in both 12 gastrocnemius‐soleus equinus and 23 non‐gastrocnemius‐soleus equinus soccer players conditions. State absolute for gastrocnemius soleus condition obtained a 0.34 value (0.19–0.5); we found a significant increase in temperature among these conditions for the gastrocnemius ( P = 0.028) and the Achilles tendon ( P = 0.007) (confidence interval 95%). The temperature of gastrocnemius‐soleus equinus for gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon was increased more than non‐gastrocnemius‐soleus equinus in youth soccer players. Conclusions IR imaging captured temperature is associated with muscle pattern activation for lower limb. Based on our findings, we propose that infrared thermography evaluation of the gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon is suitable to differ gastrocnemius‐soleus equinus and non‐gastrocnemius‐soleus equinus conditions in youth soccer players.","This paper investigates the use of thermal infrared imaging to assess skin temperature differences in youth soccer players with gastrocnemius-soleus equinus condition compared to those without.

"Polar Coordinate Analysis of Relationships With Teammates, Areas of the Pitch, and Dynamic Play in Soccer: A Study of Xabi Alonso",2018-03-23,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Psychology,"Rubén Maneiro Dios, Mario Amatria Jiménez","Research in soccer has traditionally focused on very specific aspects of the game, such as technical and physiological aspects, and has largely ignored important issues such as tactical performance and the role of individual players within the team. The aim of this study was to study the different relationships that Xabi Alonso, one of the world's best midfielders, establishes with his teammates during offensive play, and to investigate his connections with the pitch in terms of where his direct interventions started and finished, his use of technical actions, his involvement in set plays and interceptions, and his relationship with shots at goal. To do this, we analyzed all the matches played by the winner of the 2012 UEFA European Championship: Spain. We employed an observational methodology design (Anguera, 1979) using a modified version of the ad hoc soccer observation instrument designed by Amatria, Lapresa, Arana, Anguera, and Garzón (2016). The resulting data were analyzed by polar coordinate analysis (Gorospe & Anguera, 2000), which is a powerful data reduction technique with high predictive power. The results showed significant associations (>1.96= p>.05) between Alonso and players in different positions, a wide sphere of influence on the pitch, both for the start and end of interventions, and a strong link with game interruptions and interceptions and with the use of different technical actions. No significant associations were detected for type of shot. Studies on tactical performance that take account of the multiple factors involved in soccer will lead to better decision-making by coaches and facilitate analysis of a player's true performance.","This paper investigates the tactical performance of Xabi Alonso in soccer by examining his interactions with teammates and his influence on the pitch during offensive play.

Long-standing groin pain in an elite athlete: usefulness of ultrasound in differential diagnosis and patient education – a case report,2018-03-22,Informa UK Limited,European Journal of Physiotherapy,"Kingsley S. R. Dhinakar, Anjanette Cantoria Lacaste","Purpose: The purpose of this case report is to describe the diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of an athlete with long-standing groin pain. This aims to highlight the use of diagnostic ultrasound as an adjunct to physical assessment, differential diagnosis and patient education.Materials and methods: An athlete presented a groin pain with 6 months of onset, who was refractory to conservative treatment. A systematic assessment approach and ultrasound scanning in static and dynamic positions led to the diagnosis of mild tendinitis of the conjoint tendon, adductor-related groin pain and obturator nerve entrapment. Conservative management using symptom-specific treatment was implemented. Pain levels during rest, running, forward lunge and palpation were measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) each session. General health status was measured using EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). Maximum match time that the patient could play pain-free was also monitored.Results: A reduction in pain, demonstrating a reduction in VAS scores during running from 8/10 to 0/10, forward lunge from 4/10 to 0/10 and palpation from 5/10 to 0/10; improved pain-free playing duration; and improved general health status with improved EQ-5D scores were achieved. The patient was able to return to playing professional level pain-free after 3 weeks of therapy.Conclusion: The study demonstrates the usefulness of sonographic findings in differential diagnosis, patient education and treatment rationale. This case report suggests further investigation of the role of ultrasound imaging in groin pain, which may enable clinicians to apply differential diagnosis effectively. Clinicians who have access to diagnostic ultrasound or the skills to use ultrasound integrated into their clinical practice may have better treatment outcomes.","This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of an elite athlete suffering from long-standing groin pain, emphasizing the role of diagnostic ultrasound in both differential diagnosis and patient education.

Clinical Efficacy of Jump Training Augmented With Body Weight Support After ACL Reconstruction: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2018-03-20,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Audrey R.C. Elias, Kari J. Harris, Paul C. LaStayo, Ryan L. Mizner","Background: Limited knee flexion and increased muscle co-contraction during jump landing are believed to diminish outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The efficacy of jump training to improve patients’ mechanical and neuromuscular deficits is understudied. Hypothesis: Jump training will improve functional, mechanical, and neuromuscular outcomes and higher repetition training augmented by body weight support will result in better retention of gains. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Thirty athletes (18 months after surgery) were screened, and 19 with mechanical deficits and limited clinical outcomes were enrolled in the trial. Testing included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire, leg landing mechanics via motion analysis, knee joint effusion using a stroke test, and a surface electromyography–generated co-contraction index during a single-legged landing. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: jump training with normal body weight (JTBW) and high-repetition jump training with body weight support (JTBWS). Knee effusion grading throughout training was used to assess joint tolerance. Changes in outcomes over time were analyzed with mixed-effects modeling. Immediate outcomes were compared with retention testing at 8 weeks after training by use of 2-way analyses of variance with effects of time and group. Results: Significant effects of time were found during the training phase for all outcome measures, but no effects of group or sex were found. IKDC score (pooled; mean ± SD) increased from 76 ± 12 to 87 ± 8 ( P &lt; .001). Knee flexion during single-legged landing increased from 57° ± 11° to 73° ± 9° ( P &lt; .001). Average co-contraction index decreased from 37 ± 15 to 19 ± 6 ( P &lt; .001). All measures were retained over the retention period in both groups. The relative risk of knee effusion of the JTBW group versus the JTBWS group was 4.2 (95% CI, 2.25-7.71; P &lt; .001). Conclusion: Jump training mitigated some risk factors for second injury and osteoarthritis in patients after ACL reconstruction. Training made lasting improvements in physical function measures as well as mechanical and neuromuscular coordination deficits. Higher repetitions used with body weight support did not improve retention but substantially reduced risk for effusion. Clinical Relevance: Jump training is an efficacious intervention for athletes with poor outcomes after ACL reconstruction, and training with body weight support lessens the risk for excessive joint stress during practice. Registration: NCT02148172 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier)","The paper investigates the effectiveness of jump training, with and without body weight support, in improving functional and mechanical outcomes in athletes recovering from ACL reconstruction. The results indicate that jump training leads to significant improvements in knee flexion, co-contraction index, and overall physical function, while training with body weight support reduces the risk of joint effusion without affecting the retention of gains."
Muscle Strength Is a Poor Screening Test for Predicting Lower Extremity Injuries in Professional Male Soccer Players: A 2-Year Prospective Cohort Study,2018-03-13,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Arnhild Bakken, Stephen Targett, Tone Bere, Cristiano Eirale, Abdulaziz Farooq, Andrea B. Mosler, Johannes L. Tol, Rod Whiteley, Karim M. Khan, Roald Bahr","Background: Lower extremity muscle strength tests are commonly used to screen for injury risk in professional soccer. However, there is limited evidence on the ability of such tests in predicting future injuries. Purpose: To examine the association between hip and thigh muscle strength and the risk of lower extremity injuries in professional male soccer players. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Professional male soccer players from 14 teams in Qatar underwent a comprehensive strength assessment at the beginning of the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons. Testing consisted of concentric and eccentric quadriceps and hamstring isokinetic peak torques, eccentric hip adduction and abduction forces, and bilateral isometric adductor force (squeeze test at 45°). Time-loss injuries and exposure in training and matches were registered prospectively by club medical staff throughout each season. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. Results: In total, 369 players completed all strength tests and had registered injury and exposure data. Of these, 206 players (55.8%) suffered 538 lower extremity injuries during the 2 seasons; acute muscle injuries were the most frequent. Of the 20 strength measures examined, greater quadriceps concentric peak torque at 300 deg/s (HR, 1.005 [95% CI, 1.00-1.01]; P = .037) was the only strength measure identified as significantly associated with a risk of lower extremity injuries in multivariate analysis. Greater quadriceps concentric peak torque at 60 deg/s (HR, 1.004 [95% CI, 1.00-1.01]; P = .026) was associated with the risk of overuse injuries, and greater bilateral adductor strength adjusted for body weight (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.57-0.97; P = .032) was associated with a lower risk for any knee injury. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses indicated poor predictive ability of the significant strength variables (area under the curve, 0.45-0.56). Conclusion: There was a weak association with the risk of lower extremity injuries for 2 strength variables: greater quadriceps concentric muscle strength at (1) high and (2) low speeds. These associations were too small to identify an “at-risk” player. Therefore, strength testing, as performed in the present study, cannot be recommended as a screening test to predict injuries in professional male soccer.","This study investigates the relationship between lower extremity muscle strength and the risk of injuries in professional male soccer players over two seasons. The findings indicate that while some strength measures, particularly quadriceps concentric peak torque, are weakly associated with injury risk, the overall predictive ability of muscle strength tests is insufficient to effectively screen for injuries in this population."
Mitigating Sports Injury Risks Using Internet of Things and Analytics Approaches,2018-03-12,Wiley,Risk Analysis,"Gary B. Wilkerson, Ashish Gupta, Marisa A. Colston","Sport injuries restrict participation, impose a substantial economic burden, and can have persisting adverse effects on health-related quality of life. The effective use of Internet of Things (IoT), when combined with analytics approaches, can improve player safety through identification of injury risk factors that can be addressed by targeted risk reduction training activities. Use of IoT devices can facilitate highly efficient quantification of relevant functional capabilities prior to sport participation, which could substantially advance the prevailing sport injury management paradigm. This study introduces a framework for using sensor-derived IoT data to supplement other data for objective estimation of each individual college football player's level of injury risk, which is an approach to injury prevention that has not been previously reported. A cohort of 45 NCAA Division I-FCS college players provided data in the form of self-ratings of persisting effects of previous injuries and single-leg postural stability test. Instantaneous change in body mass acceleration (jerk) during the test was quantified by a smartphone accelerometer, with data wirelessly transmitted to a secure cloud server. Injuries sustained from the beginning of practice sessions until the end of the 13-game season were documented, along with the number of games played by each athlete over the course of a 13-game season. Results demonstrate a strong prediction model. Our approach may have strong relevance to the estimation of injury risk for other physically demanding activities. Clearly, there is great potential for improvement of injury prevention initiatives through identification of individual athletes who possess elevated injury risk and targeted interventions.","The paper discusses the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices combined with analytics to identify injury risk factors in college football players. It introduces a framework for quantifying individual injury risk through sensor-derived data, aiming to enhance injury prevention strategies and provide targeted training interventions."
Impact of Official Matches on Soccer Referees’ Power Performance,2018-03-12,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Daniel Castillo, Javier Yanci, Jesús Cámara","The evaluation of match officials' neuromuscular performance is now an important consideration and the vertical jump test is considered suitable for assessing lower limb power, partly because it is directly related to refereeing. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effect of soccer matches on match officials' vertical jump performance by assessing various biomechanical variables. Eighteen field referees (FRs) and 36 assistant referees (ARs) who officiated in 18 official matches participated in this study. Before the match, at half time and immediately after the match, officials performed two countermovement jumps. Flight phase time (FT), maximum force production (MFpropulsion), time to production of maximum force (TMFpropulsion), production of maximum power (MP), maximum landing force (MFlanding) and time to stabilization (TTS) were calculated for all jumps. There was a tendency for match officials' jumping performance to improve after matches than beforehand (FR: effect size (ES) = 0.19 ± 0.36, possibly trivial; AR: ES = 0.07 ± 0.17, likely trivial). There were also likely small and very likely moderate differences between FRs' MP in pre-match and half-time jumps (ES = 0.46 ± 0.47) and in their pre- and post-match jumps (ES = 0.71 ± 0.48). These results indicate that refereeing soccer matches does not reduce vertical jump performance; the subsequent neuromuscular fatigue is not sufficient to affect landing technique.","This paper investigates the impact of officiating soccer matches on the vertical jump performance of match referees. The findings suggest that match officials’ jumping ability does not decline post-match, and neuromuscular fatigue from officiating is not significant enough to affect their landing technique."

Kicking Performance in Young U9 to U20 Soccer Players: Assessment of Velocity and Accuracy Simultaneously,2018-03-07,Informa UK Limited,Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport,"Luiz H. P. Vieira, Sérgio A. Cunha, Renato Moraes, Fabio A. Barbieri, Rodrigo Aquino, Lucas de P. Oliveira, Martina Navarro, Bruno L. S. Bedo, Paulo R. P. Santiago","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the kicking performance of young soccer players in the U9 to U20 age groups. Method: Three hundred and sixty-six Brazilian players were evaluated on an official pitch using three-dimensional kinematics to measure (300 Hz) ball velocity (Vball), foot velocity (Vfoot), Vball/Vfoot ratio, last stride length, and distance between the support foot and the ball. Simultaneously, a two-dimensional procedure was also conducted to compute (60 Hz) the mean radial error, bivariate variable error, and accuracy. Possible age-related differences were assessed through one-way analysis of variance and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Ball velocity increased by 103% (p < .001, η2 = .39) from the U11 age group (48.54 ± 8.31 km/hr) to the U20 age group (98.74 ± 16.35 km/hr). Foot velocity presented a 59% increase (p < .001, η2 = .32) from the U11 age group (49.08 ± 5.16 km/hr) to U20 (78.24 ± 9.49 km/hr). This finding was due to improvement in the quality of foot–ball impact (Vball/Vfoot ratio) from U11 (0.99 ± 0.13 a.u.) to U20 (1.26 ± 0.11 a.u.; p < .001, η2 = .25). Parameters such as mean radial error and accuracy appeared to be impaired during the growth spurt (U13–U15). Last stride length was correlated, low to moderately high, with Vball in all age groups (r = .36–.79). Conclusions: In summary, we concluded that simple biomechanical parameters of kicking performance presented distinct development. These results suggest that different training strategies specific for each age group could be applied. We provide predictive equations to aid coaches in the long-term monitoring process to develop the kick in soccer or search for talented young players.","This study evaluates the kicking performance of young soccer players aged U9 to U20, using both three-dimensional kinematics and two-dimensional accuracy measures.

POSTURAL CONTROL ANALYSIS DURING A STANDARDIZED KICK TASK IN SOCCER ATHLETES,2018-03-01,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte,"Bruno Mazziotti Oliveira Alves, Rubens Alexandre da Silva Jr., Luciano Moreira Rosa, Thiago Rosa de Mesquita, Paulo Rui de Oliveira, Ricardo Lima Burigo, Cesar Ferreira Amorim","ABSTRACT Introduction: Postural control is a determining factor for functional performance and motor skills during sports activities. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate postural control during the controlled soccer ball kicking task through a biomechanical analysis system. Methods: The sample consisted of 11 professional male athletes recruited using convenience sampling, with a mean age of 22 years. The athletes performed twenty-five precision kicks at a target, with the ball in vertical motion released by means of a hand-held device synchronized with the computed biomechanical measurements. Marking of the lower limb segments involved in the kick and the ball were analyzed by accelerometry, while postural control measures were quantified by a force platform in three axes of movement. The support leg was investigated in single leg stance during all tests on the force platform. The main variables of postural control calculated by stabilographic analysis and computed during the 25 kicks were: center of pressure (COP) displacement area, velocity and frequency of COP oscillation in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. The mean was used for final analysis to determine the differences in the three phases: pre-kick, kick, and post-kick. Results: The results revealed significant differences (p &lt;0.01) between the three phases, with the kick phase presenting higher values of postural COP oscillations than the other phases. The COP area and oscillation velocity were the variables with greatest sensitivity to changes in the kick phase, obtaining an effect size of d = 14 and d = 12, respectively. In clinical terms, the increase in COP values reached 557% between the pre-kick and kick phases; this difference was reduced to 241% when compared to post-kick (i.e., difference between kick and post-kick was 316%). Conclusion . These results have important implications for the perception of postural control responses during soccer ball kicks and consequently, for injury prevention when motor and sensory deficits are diagnosed in soccer players.

Quadriceps Strength Deficit at 6 Months After ACL Reconstruction Does Not Predict Return to Preinjury Sports Level,2018-02-27,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"João Victor Novaretti, Carlos Eduardo Franciozi, Andrea Forgas, Pedro Henrique Sasaki, Sheila Jean McNeill Ingham, Rene Jorge Abdalla","There is a lack of literature-based objective criteria for return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Establishing such objective criteria is crucial to improving return to sport after ACL reconstruction (ACLR).Patients who return to their preinjury level of sport will have higher isokinetic, postural stability, and drop vertical jump test scores 6 months after surgery and greater patient satisfaction compared with those who did not. Additionally, quadriceps strength deficit cutoff values of 80% and 90% would differentiate patients who returned to preinjury sports level from those who did not.Cohort study.Level 3.A retrospective search was conducted to identify all patients who underwent ACLR and completed isokinetic evaluation, postural stability analysis, and drop vertical jump testing at 6 months postoperatively. Patients were asked to complete 3 questionnaires at a minimum 1 year after surgery. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used for categorical dependent variables, while the Student t test, Pearson correlation, or analyses of variance with Bonferroni post hoc testing were used for continuous dependent variables. A post hoc power analysis was completed. Based on the results regarding correlations between return to preinjury level and all other variables, effect sizes from 0.24 to 3.03 were calculated. With these effect sizes, an alpha of 0.05 and sample size of 58, a power ranging from 0.15 to 0.94 was calculated.The rates of return to preinjury level and to any sports activity were 53.4% and 84.4%. Those who were able to return to their preinjury level of sport (n = 33) showed significantly higher Lysholm (91.6 ± 9.7 vs 76.7 ± 15.4) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) (83.6 ± 10.6 vs 69.8 ± 14.6) values compared with those who were unable to return to their preinjury level of sport (n = 25) ( P < 0.001). No significant differences were found for the clinical evaluations between those who were and those who were not able to return at the same level for the clinical evaluations (isokinetic evaluation, postural stability, drop vertical jump test) ( P > 0.05). No significant differences were found when comparing quadriceps strength deficit with cutoff values of 80% and 90% for return to preinjury activity level (Tegner), Lysholm, and IKDC scores.Quadriceps strength deficit, regardless of cutoff value (80% or 90%), at 6 months after ACLR does not predict return to preinjury level of sport. Patients who returned to sport at their preinjury level were more satisfied with their reconstruction compared with those who did not.Quadriceps strength deficit is not a reliable predictor of return to sports, and therefore it should not be used as the single criterion in such evaluations.","This paper investigates the relationship between quadriceps strength deficit at six months post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and the ability to return to preinjury sports levels.

Normal Variability of Weekly Musculoskeletal Screening Scores and the Influence of Training Load across an Australian Football League Season,2018-02-27,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Alireza Esmaeili, Andrew M. Stewart, William G. Hopkins, George P. Elias, Brendan H. Lazarus, Amber E. Rowell, Robert J. Aughey","Aim: The sit and reach test (S&R), dorsiflexion lunge test (DLT), and adductor squeeze test (AST) are commonly used in weekly musculoskeletal screening for athlete monitoring and injury prevention purposes. The aim of this study was to determine the normal week to week variability of the test scores, individual differences in variability, and the effects of training load on the scores. Methods: Forty-four elite Australian rules footballers from one club completed the weekly screening tests on day two or three post-main training (pre-season) or post-match (in-season) over a 10 month season. Ratings of perceived exertion and session duration for all training sessions were used to derive various measures of training load via both simple summations and exponentially weighted moving averages. Data were analysed via linear and quadratic mixed modelling and interpreted using magnitude-based inference. Results: Substantial small to moderate variability was found for the tests at both season phases; for example over the in-season, the normal variability ±90% confidence limits were as follows: S&R ±1.01 cm, ±0.12; DLT ±0.48 cm, ±0.06; AST ±7.4%, ±0.6%. Small individual differences in variability existed for the S&R and AST(factor standard deviations between 1.31 and 1.66). All measures of training load had trivial effects on the screening scores. Conclusion: A change in a test score larger than the normal variability is required to be considered a true change. Athlete monitoring and flagging systems need to account for the individual differences in variability. The tests are not sensitive to internal training load when conducted two or three days post-training or post-match, and the scores should be interpreted cautiously when used as measures of recovery.","The paper examines the normal variability of weekly musculoskeletal screening scores in elite Australian rules footballers and the impact of training load on these scores throughout a season. The study identifies that substantial variability exists in tests used for athlete monitoring and suggests that monitoring systems should account for individual differences, as changes in scores need to exceed the normal variability to indicate meaningful changes."
Quantifying the association between white matter integrity changes and subconcussive head impact exposure from a single season of youth and high school football using 3D convolutional neural networks,2018-02-27,SPIE,Medical Imaging 2018: Computer-Aided Diagnosis,"Behrouz Saghafi, Gowtham Krishnan Murugesan, Alexander Powers, Elizabeth Davenport, Ben Wagner, Jillian Urban-Hobson, Mireille Kelley, Derek Jones, Christopher Whitlow, Joel Stitzel, Joseph Maldjian, Albert Montillo","The effect of subconcussive head impact exposure during contact sports, including American football, on brain health is poorly understood particularly in young and adolescent players, who may be more vulnerable to brain injury during periods of rapid brain maturation. This study aims to quantify the association between cumulative effects of head impact exposure from a single season of football on white matter (WM) integrity as measured with diffusion MRI. The study targets football players aged 9-18 years old. All players were imaged pre- and post-season with structural MRI and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI). Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps, shown to be closely correlated with WM integrity, were computed for each subject, co-registered and subtracted to compute the change in FA per subject. Biomechanical metrics were collected at every practice and game using helmet mounted accelerometers. Each head impact was converted into a risk of concussion, and the risk of concussion-weighted cumulative exposure (RWE) was computed for each player for the season. Athletes with high and low RWE were selected for a two-category classification task. This task was addressed by developing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify players into high and low impact exposure groups from the change in FA maps. Using the proposed model, high classification performance, including ROC Area Under Curve score of 85.71% and F1 score of 83.33% was achieved. This work adds to the growing body of evidence for the presence of detectable neuroimaging brain changes in white matter integrity from a single season of contact sports play, even in the absence of a clinically diagnosed concussion.","This study investigates the relationship between cumulative subconcussive head impact exposure and changes in white matter integrity in youth football players. Utilizing diffusion MRI and 3D convolutional neural networks, the research demonstrates a significant correlation between head impact exposure and detectable changes in white matter integrity, highlighting potential neuroimaging markers for brain health risks in young athletes."
Intermittent Treadmill Running Induces Kinematic Compensations to Maintain Soccer Kick Foot Speed Despite No Change in Knee Extensor Strength,2018-02-27,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,Matt Greig,"Kicking is a fundamental skill and a primary noncontact mechanism of injury in soccer, with injury incidence increasing during the latter stages of match-play. Ten male professional soccer players completed a 90-minute treadmill protocol based on the velocity profile of soccer match-play. Preexercise, and at 15-minute intervals, players completed a maximal velocity kick subjected to kinematic analysis at 200 Hz. Preexercise, and at the end of each half, players also completed isokinetic concentric knee extensor repetitions at 180°·s-1, 300°·s-1, and 60°·s-1. Kicking foot speed was maintained at ∼19 m·s-1, with no main effect for exercise duration. In relation to proximal-distal sequencing during the kicking action, there was a significant increase in the duration (but not magnitude) of thigh rotation, with a compensatory decrease in the duration (but not magnitude) of shank rotation during the latter stages of the exercise protocol. In relation to long-axis rotation, pelvic orientation at ball contact was maintained at ∼6°, representing a total pelvic rotation in the order of ∼15° during the kicking action. Peak knee extensor torque at all speeds was also maintained throughout the protocol, such that kinematic modifications are not attributable to a decline in knee extensor strength.","This paper investigates the impact of intermittent treadmill running on the kinematic adjustments made during soccer kicking, focusing on maintaining foot speed and knee extensor strength. The study finds that despite fatigue, players compensated by altering the timing of thigh and shank rotation without a significant change in kicking speed or knee strength."

Data were collected from 157 female soccer players (U16, n = 46; U14, n = 43; U12, n = 38; U10, n = 30), recruited from three high-level female soccer academies in England. Players completed assessments of anthropometry (height and body mass), isometric mid-thigh pull strength, jump height, aerobic capacity, change of direction (505-left/right) and speed (10 and 30 m). Magnitude based-inferences were used to assess for practical significance between consecutive age groups. Height ( very likely–most likely), body mass ( very likely–most likely), absolute strength ( most likely), jump height ( likely–very likely) and distance on the YYIRL1 ( possibly–most likely) were greater in older players. Both speed and change of direction time were most likely to very likely lower in older players. However, only most likely trivial–possibly trivial differences were observed in relative strength between age groups. Findings suggest that physical characteristics except for relative strength differentiate by age categories. These findings provide comparative data and target reference data for such populations and can be used by coaches and practitioners for player development purposes. Practitioners should be aware that relative strength does not differ between age categories in high-level youth female soccer players.","This study evaluates the anthropometric and performance characteristics of high-level youth female soccer players across different age categories (U10-U16).

Evaluation of Goal Scoring Patterns Between the 2016 Copa America and the 2016 European Championship,2018-02-24,Brieflands,Asian Journal of Sports Medicine,"Michele Lastella, Geoff P. Lovell, Ermanno Rampinini","Background: Soccer is one of the most popular worldwide sports and performance is dependent upon many factors including technical, biomechanical, tactical, psychological and physiological aspects. Previous investigations have identified that the frequency of goals increases as matches progress, however, previous research in this area is limited as it is based on data from very few competitions. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine the goal scoring patterns between two major international tournaments, the 2016 European championship and the 2016 Copa America. Methods: The sample consisted of 83 games: 51 games from the 2016 European Championship and 32 from the 2016 Copa America. Results: A total of 197 goals scored in 83 games were analysed. Analyses revealed that a significantly greater percentage of total match goals were scored in the first half Copa America matches compared to the European championship (47.8% vs. 39.3%, P = 0.02). No differences were found in the second half between tournaments. There was a significantly higher goal scoring frequency in the second half (60.7%) compared to the first half (39.3%) in the European championship (P = 0.02), but no differences were found between halves for the Copa America. Chi square analysis revealed a significantly (P < 0.01) higher goal scoring frequency in the first 15-minute interval for the Copa America (24%) compared to the first 15 minutes of the European Championship (12%). Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that South American nations appear to take an offensive approach in the first 15 minutes which is indicative that there may be a country-related style of play related to goal scoring patterns in major international tournaments. Future studies need to extend this research across several international tournaments and/or between club versus country to determine if there is a country-related style of play element to goal scoring patterns between European and South American international tournaments.","This paper analyzes goal scoring patterns in soccer during the 2016 European Championship and the 2016 Copa America, revealing significant differences in goal frequency between the two tournaments.

“The Early Specialised Bird Catches the Worm!” – A Specialised Sampling Model in the Development of Football Talents,2018-02-21,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Psychology,"Roland Sieghartsleitner, Claudia Zuber, Marc Zibung, Achim Conzelmann","Characteristics of learning activities in early sport participation play a key role in the development of the sporting talent. Therefore, pathways of specialisation or diversification/sampling are as well debated as the implementation of practice- or play-oriented activities. The related issues are currently perceived as a two-dimensional construct of domain specificity and performance orientation. In this context, it has been shown that early specialisation, with experiences in practice and play, has led to Swiss junior national team football players reaching higher success levels as adults. This study aimed to examine whether a similar approach improves chances of even being selected for junior national teams from a broader sample. Hence, 294 youth players answered retrospective questionnaires on their early sport participation when entering the Swiss football talent development programme. Using the person-oriented Linking of Clusters after removal of a Residue (LICUR) method, volumes of in-club practice, free play and activities besides football until 12 years of age were analysed along with age at initial club participation. According to the results, clusters of Football enthusiasts (p = 0.01) with the most free play and above average in-club practice and Club players (p = 0.02) with the most in-club practice and average free play had a greater chance of reaching junior national team level. Thus, high levels of domain-specific activities seem to increase the chances of junior national team participation. Furthermore, the most successful constellation (Football enthusiasts) may illustrate the relevance of domain-specific diversity, induced by several types of practice and play. In line with previous studies, specialising in football and sampling different experiences within this specific domain seems to be the most promising pathway. Therefore, we argue that the optimal model for the development of football talents is a specialised sampling model.","This paper investigates the impact of early specialization in sport on the development of football talent, focusing on how different learning activities influence success in junior national teams. The findings suggest that a balance of in-club practice and free play, particularly among ""Football enthusiasts,"" enhances the likelihood of reaching competitive levels, advocating for a specialized sampling model in talent development."

A linear impactor was used to impact a helmeted Hybrid III headform in several locations and using centric and non-centric impact vectors. The resulting dynamic response was used as input for the Wayne State Brain Injury Model to determine the risk of concussive injury by utilizing maximum principal strain as the predictive variable. The results demonstrated that impacts that occur primarily to the side of the head resulted in higher magnitudes of strain in the grey and white matter, as well as the brain stem. Finally, commonly worn American football helmets were used in this research and significant risk of injury was incurred for all impacts. These results suggest that improvements in American football helmets are warranted, in particular for impacts to the side of the helmet.","This research investigates the relationship between the location of impacts on American football helmets and the risk of concussive injury using finite element modeling of the human head and brain.

Using a qualitative multiple case study design, semi-structured interviews with community-AF coaches in Victoria, Australia, were conducted. Overall, coaches believed a range of strategies were important including: coach education, policy drivers, overcoming potential problem areas, a ‘try before you buy approach’, presenting empirical evidence and guidelines for injury-prevention exercise programs (IPEPs), forming strategic collaboration and working in partnership, communication and social marketing, public meetings, development of a coach hotline, and targeted multi-focused approaches. A shift to a culture whereby evidence-based IPEP practices in community-AF will take time, and persistent commitment by all involved in the sport is important. This will support the creation of strategies that will enhance the dissemination and scale-up of LL-IPEPs across community sport environments. The focus of research needs to continue to identify effective, holistic and multi-level interventions to support coaches in preventing LLIs. This could lead to the determination of successful strategies such as behavioural regulation strategies and emotional coping resources to implement LL-IPEPs into didactic curricula and practice.

Safety concerns regarding their use have been raised; however, research and understanding is limited. Recently, FIFA has taken steps to assess possible injury mechanisms associated with wearing EPTS devices. This study identifies potential injury scenarios in football and associated impact energies. EPTS device use was first surveyed by questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Unexpected, backward falls were highlighted as potential injury scenarios. An anthropomorphic test device (ATD), wearing a mock-EPTS device, was dropped onto 3G turf. Impact energy was 142.4 ± 42.1 and 5.8 ± 4.0 J whilst wearing and not wearing mock-EPTS devices respectively. Results indicate that wearing EPTS devices markedly increased impact energy experienced at the upper-back during falls. Further investigation into possible injury mechanisms (e.g., EPTS device shape and/or contact-area) of skin laceration and/or contusion risk, is warranted.","The paper investigates the potential injury scenarios associated with wearing electronic performance and tracking system (EPTS) devices in football and the impact energies related to these injuries.

A motion capture system including an embedded force plate covered by a synthetic material for futsal pitch, were utilized to collect the ground reaction force components. During FTT and STT, the multi-studded outsole was characterized by significantly higher mean peak traction forces. Moreover, although there were no significant differences in peak coefficient of traction between the two types of futsal shoes during STT, the multi-studded outsole tended to produce marginally higher peak coefficient of traction during FTT. It can be concluded that the multi-studded outsole design is prone to generate higher traction force and coefficient of traction.",The paper investigates the interaction between futsal footwear and pitch surfaces under different outsole conditions to enhance performance and prevent injuries.

Timing of early force peaks was analyzed within 100 ms after ground contact.Genders showed different mean (95% CI) time to peak valgus-(32 ms (30-33 ms) vs 37 ms (36-38 ms), P < 0.001) and time to peak internal rotation moments (36 ms (35-37 ms) vs 38 ms (37-39 ms), P = 0.029) but not time to peak vertical ground reaction force [38 ms (37-40 ms) vs 37 ms (36-38 ms, n.s.)]. Girls showed a smaller time between vertical ground reaction force and valgus moment peaks (mean (95% CI) of 1 ms (1-2 ms) vs 7 ms (5-9 ms), P < 0.001), and valgus- and internal rotation moment peaks (0 ms (- 2 to 1.0 ms) vs - 5 ms (- 6 to - 3 ms), P = 0.0003) but not between internal rotation moment and vertical ground reaction force.Concurrent force peaks are more common for girls compared with boys, leading to more frequent multi-planar loading of the knee. Timing may explain sex-dependent risk of ACL injuries. Exposure to repeated cutting movements may result in greater ACL injury risk due to timing of knee forces as well as magnitude.

Is stiffness related to athletic groin pain?,2018-02-09,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"S. J. Gore, A. Franklyn‐Miller, C. Richter, E. C. Falvey, E. King, K. Moran","Abstract Athletic groin pain ( AGP ) is a common injury prevalent in field sports. One biomechanical measure that may be of importance for injury risk is stiffness. To date however, stiffness has not been examined in AGP . The primary aim was to determine whether AGP affects vertical and joint stiffness and if so, whether successful rehabilitation is associated with a change in stiffness. Sixty‐five male patients with AGP and fifty male controls were recruited to this study. Assessment included a biomechanical examination of stiffness during a lateral hurdle hop test. Subjects with AGP were tested pre‐ and post‐rehabilitation, while controls were tested once. AGP subjects were cleared for return to play in a median time of 9.14 weeks (5.14‐29.0). Stiffness was significantly different at pre‐rehabilitation in comparison with controls for four of the ten stiffness values examined: ankle plantar flexor, knee extensor, hip abductor, and vertical stiffness ( P &lt; .05, D = 0.36‐0.79). Despite clearance for return to play, of these four variables, only hip abductor stiffness changed significantly from pre‐ to post‐rehabilitation ( P = .05, D = 0.35) to become non‐significantly different to the uninjured group ( P = .18, D = 0.26). These findings suggest that hip abductor stiffness may represent a target for AGP rehabilitation. Conversely, given the clearance for return to play, the lower sagittal plane and vertical stiffness in the AGP group in comparison with the uninjured controls likely represents either a compensatory mechanism to reduce the risk of further injury or a consequence of neuromuscular detraining.","This paper investigates the relationship between stiffness and athletic groin pain (AGP) in male athletes. It finds significant differences in stiffness measures between AGP patients and controls, with a focus on hip abductor stiffness as a potential rehabilitation target, and suggests that altered stiffness may either serve as a compensatory mechanism or result from neuromuscular detraining."
Validity and reliability of GPS and LPS for measuring distances covered and sprint mechanical properties in team sports,2018-02-08,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Matthias W. Hoppe, Christian Baumgart, Ted Polglaze, Jürgen Freiwald","This study aimed to investigate the validity and reliability of global (GPS) and local (LPS) positioning systems for measuring distances covered and sprint mechanical properties in team sports. Here, we evaluated two recently released 18 Hz GPS and 20 Hz LPS technologies together with one established 10 Hz GPS technology. Six male athletes (age: 27±2 years; VO2max: 48.8±4.7 ml/min/kg) performed outdoors on 10 trials of a team sport-specific circuit that was equipped with double-light timing gates. The circuit included various walking, jogging, and sprinting sections that were performed either in straight-lines or with changes of direction. During the circuit, athletes wore two devices of each positioning system. From the reported and filtered velocity data, the distances covered and sprint mechanical properties (i.e., the theoretical maximal horizontal velocity, force, and power output) were computed. The sprint mechanical properties were modeled via an inverse dynamic approach applied to the center of mass. The validity was determined by comparing the measured and criterion data via the typical error of estimate (TEE), whereas the reliability was examined by comparing the two devices of each technology (i.e., the between-device reliability) via the coefficient of variation (CV). Outliers due to measurement errors were statistically identified and excluded from validity and reliability analyses. The 18 Hz GPS showed better validity and reliability for determining the distances covered (TEE: 1.6–8.0%; CV: 1.1–5.1%) and sprint mechanical properties (TEE: 4.5–14.3%; CV: 3.1–7.5%) than the 10 Hz GPS (TEE: 3.0–12.9%; CV: 2.5–13.0% and TEE: 4.1–23.1%; CV: 3.3–20.0%). However, the 20 Hz LPS demonstrated superior validity and reliability overall (TEE: 1.0–6.0%; CV: 0.7–5.0% and TEE: 2.1–9.2%; CV: 1.6–7.3%). For the 10 Hz GPS, 18 Hz GPS, and 20 Hz LPS, the relative loss of data sets due to measurement errors was 10.0%, 20.0%, and 15.8%, respectively. This study shows that 18 Hz GPS has enhanced validity and reliability for determining movement patterns in team sports compared to 10 Hz GPS, whereas 20 Hz LPS had superior validity and reliability overall. However, compared to 10 Hz GPS, 18 Hz GPS and 20 Hz LPS technologies had more outliers due to measurement errors, which limits their practical applications at this time.","This study investigates the validity and reliability of global positioning systems (GPS) and local positioning systems (LPS) for measuring distances and sprint mechanical properties in team sports. The findings indicate that the 18 Hz GPS provides improved validity and reliability over the 10 Hz GPS for tracking movement patterns, while the 20 Hz LPS outperformed both in overall reliability, despite the presence of measurement errors affecting data sets."
Sports Concussion: A Clinical Overview,2018-02-07,InTech,Sport and Exercise Science,Andrew J. Gardner,"Concussion is an injury risk associated with participation in collision sports. It has been identified as a research priority for many contacts and collision sports governing bodies worldwide. However, concussion remains under-researched in terms of clinical translation from both experimental models to clinical understanding, and from clinical studies to sports policy. Currently, the clinical management of concussion is largely guided by the presence or absence of symptoms with recovery indicated once all post-injury symptoms have resolved. Management of concussion includes physical and cognitive rest until acute symptoms resolve, with a graded program of exertion implemented prior to medical clearance and return-to-play. Considering the potential sequelae, the heterogeneity of symptoms, and the lack of an intervention known to prevent concussion, it is not any wonder that concussion is one of the most complex and perplexing injuries faced by medical professionals, and why making the return-to-play decision can be quite challenging. This chapter will provide an overview of the current clinical management guidelines and research literature pertaining to identification and diagnosis of injury, acute and post-acute management, and return-to-play decision-making. The traditional standard assessment process (e.g., symptom reporting, cognitive assessment, balance testing), new methods and advanced technology (e.g., ocular-motor testing, neuroimaging techniques), and biomarkers (e.g., blood plasma and serum, fluid) have led to greater insights into sports concussion and will also be briefly explored in this chapter.","This paper provides a comprehensive overview of concussion management in collision sports, highlighting its significance as an injury risk and research priority. It discusses the complexities of clinical management, including assessing symptoms, advanced diagnostic techniques, and the challenges surrounding return-to-play decisions."
Novel technique for repairing posterior medial meniscus root tears using porcine knees and biomechanical study,2018-02-06,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Jia-Lin Wu, Chian-Her Lee, Chan-Tsung Yang, Chia-Ming Chang, Guoan Li, Cheng-Kung Cheng, Chih-Hwa Chen, Hsu-Shan Huang, Yu-Shu Lai","Transtibial pullout suture (TPS) repair of posterior medial meniscus root (PMMR) tears was shown to achieve good clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare biomechanically, a novel technique designed to repair PMMR tears using tendon graft (TG) and conventional TPS repair. Twelve porcine tibiae (n = 6 each) TG group: flexor digitorum profundus tendon was passed through an incision in the root area, created 5 mm postero-medially along the edge of the attachment area. TPS group: a modified Mason-Allen suture was created using no. 2 FiberWire. The tendon grafts and sutures were threaded through the bone tunnel and then fixed to the anterolateral cortex of the tibia. The two groups underwent cyclic loading followed by a load-to-failure test. Displacements of the constructs after 100, 500, and 1000 loading cycles, and the maximum load, stiffness, and elongation at failure were recorded. The TG technique had significantly lower elongation and higher stiffness compared with the TPS. The maximum load of the TG group was significantly lower than that of the TPS group. Failure modes for all specimens were caused by the suture or graft cutting through the meniscus. Lesser elongation and higher stiffness of the constructs in TG technique over those in the standard TPS technique might be beneficial for postoperative biological healing between the meniscus and tibial plateau. However, a slower rehabilitation program might be necessary due to its relatively lower maximum failure load.","This paper investigates a novel technique for repairing posterior medial meniscus root tears using tendon grafts (TG) compared to the conventional transtibial pullout suture (TPS) method. The study reveals that while the TG technique demonstrated lower elongation and higher stiffness, indicating potential benefits for postoperative healing, it also had a lower maximum load capacity, suggesting a need for a modified rehabilitation approach."

J Strength Cond Res 32(4): 885–893, 2018—This study aimed to compare the effects of drop-jump training using a fixed drop-box height (i.e., 30-cm [FIXED]) vs. an optimal (OPT) drop-box height (i.e., 10-cm to 40-cm: generating an OPT reactive strength index [RSI]) in youth soccer players' physical fitness. Athletes were randomly allocated to a control group ( n = 24; age = 13.7 years), a fixed drop-box height group (FIXED, n = 25; age = 13.9 years), or an OPT drop-box height group (OPT, n = 24; age = 13.1 years). Before and after 7 weeks of training, tests for the assessment of jumping (countermovement jump [CMJ], 5 multiple bounds), speed (20-m sprint time), change of direction ability (CODA [Illinois test]), strength {RSI and 5 maximal squat repetition test (5 repetition maximum [RM])}, endurance (2.4-km time trial), and kicking ability (maximal kicking distance) were undertaken. Analyses revealed main effects of time for all dependent variables ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.24–0.72), except for 20-m sprint time. Analyses also revealed group × time interactions for CMJ ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.51), depth jump (DJ) ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.30), 20-m sprint time ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.25), CODA ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.22), and 5RM ( p &lt; 0.01, d = 0.16). Post hoc analyses revealed increases for the FIXED group (CMJ: 7.4%, d = 0.36; DJ: 19.2%, d = 0.49; CODA: −3.1%, d = −0.21; 5RM: 10.5%, d = 0.32) and the OPT group (CMJ: 16.7%, d = 0.76; DJ: 36.1%, d = 0.79; CODA: −4.4%, d = −0.34; 5RM: 18.1%, d = 0.47). Post hoc analyses also revealed increases for the OPT group in 20-m sprint time (−3.7%, d = 0.27). Therefore, to maximize the effects of plyometric training, an OPT approach is recommended. However, using adequate fixed drop-box heights may provide a rational and practical alternative.","This study investigates the effects of different drop-box heights on the physical fitness of young soccer players during plyometric training, specifically comparing a fixed height to an optimal height that generates a reactive strength index. The findings suggest that an optimal drop-box height can maximize improvements in various fitness measures, while fixed height training may still be a practical alternative."

Objective To examine the roles of different types of stressors as well as the effect of motivational climate on the occurrence of acute and overuse injuries. Methods Players in the Norwegian elite female football league (n=193 players from 12 teams) participated in baseline screening tests prior to the 2009 competitive football season. As part of the screening, we included the Life Event Survey for Collegiate Athletes and the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire (Norwegian short version). Acute and overuse time-loss injuries and exposure to training and matches were recorded prospectively in the football season using weekly text messaging. Data were analysed with Bayesian logistic regression analyses. Results Using Bayesian logistic regression analyses, we showed that perceived negative life event stress from teammates was associated with an increased risk of acute injuries (OR=1.23, 95% credibility interval (1.01 to 1.48)). There was a credible positive association between perceived negative life event stress from the coach and the risk of overuse injuries (OR=1.21, 95% credibility interval (1.01 to 1.45)). Conclusions Players who report teammates as a source of stress have a greater risk of sustaining an acute injury, while players reporting the coach as a source of stress are at greater risk of sustaining an overuse injury.

In the same week, the players were submitted to field tests and actual matches. The field tests were: Maximum Speed (10-30 m), Zig-Zag, Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test, and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1. Additionally, participants performed actual soccer match-play. Match running performance was collected using a fixed video-camera. Subsequently, computerized tracking video-analysis (30 Hz) was utilized to identify each physical performance indicator. Pearson's correlation and linear regression were used for statistical analysis.The results showed that the majority of field tests were not related to match running performance. The Zig-Zag Test, Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test, and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 seem to be the most specific tests (r=0.41-0.47), however the explanatory powers of these field tests in relation to match running performance were low (R2=17-22%).Assessment of match running performance should be included in the evaluation periods of young soccer players, together with the most specific tests reported.","This study investigates the correlation between field tests and match running performance in high-level young Brazilian soccer players using tracking technology. It concludes that while certain field tests like the Zig-Zag Test and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test show some specificity regarding match running performance, their overall predictive power is low, highlighting a need to incorporate match performance assessments alongside traditional tests."

Validation of a Custom Instrumented Retainer Form Factor for Measuring Linear and Angular Head Impact Kinematics,2018-01-30,ASME International,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,"Logan E. Miller, Calvin Kuo, Lyndia C. Wu, Jillian E. Urban, David B. Camarillo, Joel D. Stitzel","Head impact exposure in popular contact sports is not well understood, especially in the youth population, despite recent advances in impact-sensing technology which has allowed widespread collection of real-time head impact data. Previous studies indicate that a custom-instrumented mouthpiece is a superior method for collecting accurate head acceleration data. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mounting a sensor device inside an acrylic retainer form factor to measure six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) head kinematic response. This study compares 6DOF mouthpiece kinematics at the head center of gravity (CG) to kinematics measured by an anthropomorphic test device (ATD). This study found that when instrumentation is mounted in the rigid retainer form factor, there is good coupling with the upper dentition and highly accurate kinematic results compared to the ATD. Peak head kinematics were correlated with r2 > 0.98 for both rotational velocity and linear acceleration and r2 = 0.93 for rotational acceleration. These results indicate that a rigid retainer-based form factor is an accurate and promising method of collecting head impact data. This device can be used to study head impacts in helmeted contact sports such as football, hockey, and lacrosse as well as nonhelmeted sports such as soccer and basketball. Understanding the magnitude and frequency of impacts sustained in various sports using an accurate head impact sensor, such as the one presented in this study, will improve our understanding of head impact exposure and sports-related concussion.","This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a custom instrumented retainer for measuring head impact kinematics in contact sports. The study demonstrates that the retainer sensor provides highly accurate data on head kinematics compared to conventional testing methods, which can enhance the understanding of head impact exposure in various sports contexts."

Lamond, Jaclyn B. Caccese, Thomas A. Buckley, Joseph Glutting, Thomas W. Kaminski","Context: Heading, an integral component of soccer, exposes athletes to a large number of head impacts over a career. The literature has begun to indicate that cumulative exposure may lead to long-term functional and psychological deficits. Quantifying an athlete's exposure over a season is a first step in understanding cumulative exposure. Objective: To measure the frequency and magnitude of direct head impacts in collegiate women's soccer players across impact type, player position, and game or practice scenario. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I institution. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-three collegiate women's soccer athletes. Main Outcome Measure(s): Athletes wore Smart Impact Monitor accelerometers during all games and practices. Impacts were classified during visual, on-field monitoring of athletic events. All direct head impacts that exceeded the 10g threshold were included in the final data analysis. The dependent variable was linear acceleration, and the fixed effects were (1) type of impact: clear, pass, shot, unintentional deflection, or head-to-head contact; (2) field position: goalkeeper, defense, forward, or midfielder; (3) playing scenario: game or practice. Results: Shots (32.94g ± 12.91g, n = 38; P = .02) and clears (31.09g ± 13.43g, n = 101; P = .008) resulted in higher mean linear accelerations than passes (26.11g ± 15.48g, n = 451). Head-to-head impacts (51.26g ± 36.61g, n = 13; P &amp;lt; .001) and unintentional deflections (37.40g ± 34.41g, n = 24; P = .002) resulted in higher mean linear accelerations than purposeful headers (ie, shots, clears, and passes). No differences were seen in linear acceleration across player position or playing scenario. Conclusions: Nonheader impacts, including head-to-head impacts and unintentional deflections, resulted in higher mean linear accelerations than purposeful headers, including shots, clears, and passes, but occurred infrequently on the field. Therefore, these unanticipated impacts may not add substantially to an athlete's cumulative exposure, which is a function of both frequency and magnitude of impact.","This paper investigates the frequency and magnitude of direct head impacts experienced by collegiate women's soccer players during games and practices. It finds that nonheader impacts, such as head-to-head contacts and unintentional deflections, generate higher linear accelerations than purposeful headers, though these nonheader events occur infrequently, suggesting their impact on cumulative exposure may be limited."
Importance of Strength and Power on Key Performance Indicators in Elite Youth Soccer,2018-01-26,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Christopher E. Wing, Anthony N. Turner, Chris J. Bishop","Abstract Wing, CE, Turner, AN, and Bishop, CJ. Importance of strength and power on key performance indicators in elite youth soccer. J Strength Cond Res 34(7): 2006–2014, 2020—The purpose of this investigation was to examine the importance of strength and power in relation to key performance indicators (KPIs) within competitive soccer match play. This was achieved through using an experimental approach in which 15 subjects were recruited from a professional soccer club's scholarship squad during the 2013/14 season. Following anthropometric measures, power and strength were assessed across a range of tests which included the squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), 20-m sprint, and arrowhead change of direction test. A predicted 1 repetition maximum (1RM) was also obtained for strength by performing a 3-RM test for both the back squat and bench press, and a total score of athleticism (TSA) was provided by summing Z-scores for all fitness tests together, providing 1 complete score for athleticism. Performance analysis data were collected during 16 matches for the following KPIs: passing, shooting, dribbling, tackling, and heading. Alongside this, data concerning player ball involvements (touches) were recorded. Results showed that there was a significant correlation ( p ≤ 0.05) between CMJ ( r = 0.80), SJ ( r = 0.79), and TSA ( r = 0.64) in relation to heading success. Similarly, a significant correlation ( p ≤ 0.05) between predicted 1RM squat strength and tackle success ( r = 0.61). These data support the notion that strength and power training are important to soccer performance, particularly when players are required to win duels of a physical nature. There were no other relationships found between the fitness data and the KPIs recorded during match play, which may indicate that other aspects of a player's development such as technical skill, cognitive function, and sensory awareness are more important for soccer-specific performance.","This paper investigates the significance of strength and power in relation to key performance indicators (KPIs) in elite youth soccer, using a sample of 15 athletes and various strength tests. The findings highlight a substantial correlation between specific strength and power metrics and certain performance outcomes, particularly in heading and tackling, while suggesting that other factors like technical skill and cognitive function play a vital role in overall soccer performance."

Effects of Subsensory Noise and Fatigue on Knee Landing and Cross-over Cutting Biomechanics in Male Athletes,2018-01-24,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Xingda Qu, Jianxin Jiang, Xinyao Hu","The objective of this study was to examine the effects of subsensory noise and fatigue on knee biomechanics during the athletic task of landing followed by cross-over cutting. A total of 32 healthy male athletes participated in the study. They were evenly divided into 2 groups: no fatigue group and fatigue group. Fatigue was induced to the lower extremity by a repetitive squatting exercise in the fatigue group. Subsensory noise was generated by linear miniature vibrators bilaterally placed around the knee joints. During data collection, the participants were instructed to perform landing followed by cross-over cutting in both the subsensory on and off conditions. Dependent variables were selected to assess knee biomechanics in the phases of landing and cross-over cutting, separately. Results showed that fatigue resulted in larger knee flexion during landing and larger knee internal rotation during cross-over cutting. Subsensory noise was found to reduce knee rotation impulse during cross-over cutting. These findings suggest that cross-over cutting is more dangerous than landing in the fatigue condition, and subsensory noise may lead to changes in knee biomechanics consistent with reduced risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, but the changes may be task-specific.","This study investigates the impact of subsensory noise and fatigue on knee biomechanics during landing and cross-over cutting in male athletes. Findings indicate that fatigue increases knee flexion and internal rotation during these movements, while subsensory noise may mitigate risks of anterior cruciate ligament injuries by altering knee biomechanics, with implications for athletic performance and injury prevention."

J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2094-2103, 2019-The aim was to compare the effects of 2 differing 8-week in-season strength training programs (contrast strength training [CST] vs. plyometric training [PT]) on selected performance tests (5 and 40 m sprints, S 4 × 5 m change of direction test, squat jump [SJ] and countermovement jump [CMJ], leg peak power on a cycle-ergometer force-velocity test, 1 repetition maximal half-squat, and electromyographic [EMG] activity of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris muscles during vertical jump tests). Forty male soccer players (age = 15.8 ± 0.4 years; body mass = 58.8 ± 6.3 kg; body height = 1.74 ± 0.06 m; body fat = 10.5 ± 1.9%) were divided between a contrast strength group (CSG, n = 14), plyometric group (PG, n = 14), and control group (CG, n = 12). Both training programs enhanced sprint performance (p < 0.001 in 5 m; p ≤ 0.05 in 40 m) and change of direction test scores (p < 0.001) relative to controls. The plyometric group and CSG increased SJ height relative to the CG, with a slightly greater response in CSG compared with PG (p ≤ 0.05). Most CMJ scores increased significantly in both CSG and PG relative to the CG, with no intergroup differences in training response. Most force-velocity scores increased significantly in the CSG relative to PG and CG. The EMG parameters also increased in the CSG relative to both PG and CG. In summary, most measures of athletic performance in male soccer players were enhanced after CST and PT. However, the improvement of physical performance was better with 8 weeks of CST than with PT. Thus, coaches should be encouraged to include CST as an element of in-season conditioning.","This paper compares the effects of contrast strength training and plyometric training on lower-limb explosive performance, change of direction ability, and neuromuscular adaptation in male soccer players. The results indicate that both training methods enhanced athletic performance, but contrast strength training was more effective than plyometric training in improving certain physical performance metrics and electromyographic activity."

Comparison of Step-by-Step Kinematics in Repeated 30-m Sprints in Female Soccer Players,2018-01-16,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,Roland van den Tillaar,"van den Tillaar, R. Comparison of step-by-step kinematics in repeated 30-m sprints in female soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 32(7): 1923-1928, 2018-The aim of this study was to compare kinematics in repeated 30-m sprints in female soccer players. Seventeen subjects performed seven 30-m sprints every 30 seconds in one session. Kinematics was measured with an infrared contact mat and laser gun, and running times with an electronic timing device. The main findings were that sprint times increased in the repeated-sprint ability test. The main changes in kinematics during the repeated-sprint ability test were increased contact time and decreased step frequency, whereas no change in step length was observed. The step velocity increased in almost each step until the 14th, which occurred around 22 m. After this, the velocity was stable until the last step, when it decreased. This increase in step velocity was mainly caused by the increased step length and decreased contact times. It was concluded that the fatigue induced in repeated 30-m sprints in female soccer players resulted in decreased step frequency and increased contact time. Using this approach in combination with a laser gun and infrared mat for 30 m makes it very easy to analyze running kinematics in repeated sprints in training. This extra information gives the athlete, coach, and sports scientist the opportunity to give more detailed feedback and helps to target these changes in kinematics better to enhance repeated-sprint performance.","This study investigates the kinematics of repeated 30-m sprints in female soccer players, analyzing changes in running technique over multiple trials. Key findings indicate that fatigue results in decreased step frequency and increased contact time, providing valuable insights for athletes and coaches to enhance training and performance in repeated-sprint scenarios."
Does inside passing contribute to the high incidence of groin injuries in soccer? A biomechanical analysis,2018-01-15,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Thomas Dupré, Johannes Funken, Ralf Müller, Kristian R. L. Mortensen, Filip Gertz Lysdal, Markus Braun, Hartmut Krahl, Wolfgang Potthast","Groin injuries are common in soccer and often cause time-loss from training. While groin injuries have been linked to full effort kicking, the role of inside passing is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate hip joint kinematics and muscle force, stress and contraction velocity for adductor longus and gracilis during inside passing. 3D kinematics of ten soccer players (23.4 yrs; 77.5 kg; 1.81 m) were captured with a motion capture system inside a Footbonaut. Muscle force and contraction velocity were determined with AnyBody Modelling System. Gracilis muscle forces were 9% lower compared to adductor longus (p = 0.005), but muscle stress was 183% higher in gracilis (p = 0.005). Contraction velocity reveals eccentric contraction of gracilis in the last quarter of the swing phase. Considering the combination of eccentric contraction, high muscle stress and the repetitive nature of inside passing, gracilis accumulates high loads in matches and training. These results indicate that the high incidence of groin injuries in soccer could be linked to isolated pass training. Practitioners need to be aware of the risk and refrain from sudden increases in the amount of pass training. This gives the musculoskeletal system time to adapt and might avoid career threatening injuries.","This paper investigates the biomechanical factors contributing to groin injuries in soccer, focusing specifically on inside passing. The study reveals that the gracilis experiences higher muscle stress and eccentric contraction compared to the adductor longus during inside passes, suggesting a link between these factors and the prevalence of groin injuries, highlighting the need for careful training practices to mitigate risk."
Experimental Evaluation of UWB Indoor Positioning for Sport Postures,2018-01-09,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Matteo Ridolfi, Stef Vandermeeren, Jense Defraye, Heidi Steendam, Joeri Gerlo, Dirk De Clercq, Jeroen Hoebeke, Eli De Poorter","Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor positioning systems (IPSs) use wireless technologies (including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and ultra-wide band (UWB)) to estimate the location of persons in areas where no Global Positioning System (GPS) reception is available, for example in indoor stadiums or sports halls. Of the above-mentioned forms of radio frequency (RF) technology, UWB is considered one of the most accurate approaches because it can provide positioning estimates with centimeter-level accuracy. However, it is not yet known whether UWB can also offer such accurate position estimates during strenuous dynamic activities in which moves are characterized by fast changes in direction and velocity. To answer this question, this paper investigates the capabilities of UWB indoor localization systems for tracking athletes during their complex (and most of the time unpredictable) movements. To this end, we analyze the impact of on-body tag placement locations and human movement patterns on localization accuracy and communication reliability. Moreover, two localization algorithms (particle filter and Kalman filter) with different optimizations (bias removal, non-line-of-sight (NLoS) detection, and path determination) are implemented. It is shown that although the optimal choice of optimization depends on the type of movement patterns, some of the improvements can reduce the localization error by up to 31%. Overall, depending on the selected optimization and on-body tag placement, our algorithms show good results in terms of positioning accuracy, with average errors in position estimates of 20 cm. This makes UWB a suitable approach for tracking dynamic athletic activities.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of ultra-wideband (UWB) indoor positioning systems for accurately tracking athletes during dynamic movements in indoor sports environments.

Risk assessment of the onset of Osgood–Schlatter disease using kinetic analysis of various motions in sports,2018-01-08,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Gento Itoh, Hideyuki Ishii, Haruyasu Kato, Yasuharu Nagano, Hiroteru Hayashi, Hiroki Funasaki","Background Some studies have listed motions that may cause Osgood-Schlatter disease, but none have quantitatively assessed the load on the tibial tubercle by such motions. Purposes To quantitatively identify the load on the tibial tubercle through a biomechanical approach using various motions that may cause Osgood-Schlatter disease, and to compare the load between different motions. Methods Eight healthy male subjects were included. They conducted 4 types of kicks with a soccer ball, 2 types of runs, 2 types of squats, 2 types of jump landings, 2 types of stops, 1 type of turn, and 1 type of cutting motion. The angular impulse was calculated for knee extension moments ≥1.0 Nm/kg, ≥1.5 Nm/kg, ≥2.0 Nm/kg, and ≥2.5 Nm/kg. After analysis of variance, the post-hoc test was used to perform pairwise comparisons between all groups. Results/Conclusions The motion with the highest mean angular impulse of knee extension moment ≥1.0 Nm/kg was the single-leg landing after a jump, and that with the second highest mean was the cutting motion. At ≥1.5 Nm/kg, ≥2.0 Nm/kg, and ≥2.5 Nm/kg, the cutting motion was the highest, followed by the jump with a single-leg landing. They have a large load, and are associated with a higher risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease. The mean angular impulse of the 2 types of runs was small at all the indicators. Clinical relevance Motions with a high risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease and low-risk motions can be assessed in further detail if future studies can quantify the load and number of repetitions that may cause Osgood-Schlatter disease while considering age and the development stage. Scheduled training regimens that balance load on the tibial tubercle with low-load motions after a training day of many load-intensive motions may prevent athletes from developing Osgood-Schlatter disease and increase their participation in sports.","The paper investigates the kinetic analysis of various sports motions to assess the risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease, focusing on the load exerted on the tibial tubercle. It concludes that certain movements, particularly single-leg landings and cutting motions, impose higher angular impulses, indicating a greater risk of the disease, which could inform future training regimens to mitigate this risk in young athletes."
Frequency of Self-Reported Concussion Amongst Professional and Semi-Professional Footballers in Ireland During the 2014 Season: a Cross-Sectional Study,2018-01-08,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Nicola Coffey, Martin Lawless, Seamus Kelly, Conor Buggy","This paper examines the occupational risk of concussion amongst professional and semi-professional footballers in Ireland during the 2014 League of Ireland season. As part of a broader nationally representative study examining occupational safety and health (OSH) awareness amongst professional footballers, this empirical quantitative study, utilising a convenience sample is the first and largest investigation of the frequency of, and attitudes towards, concussion and concussion reporting amongst Irish senior professional and semi-professional footballers. A census survey using an anonymous questionnaire was provided to available League of Ireland clubs between March and May 2015. Permission to access players was provided by the Professional Footballers Association of Ireland. This convenience sample was determined by club availability in relation to match fixtures. Participation by the footballers was voluntary. At the time, there were 250 professional and semi-professional players within the League available to participate. A total of 149 footballers participated in the study. Sixty percent of the participants were employed on a semi-professional basis and the majority of all participants were aged between 18 and 30. 15.7% of the participants reported having received a concussion in the 2014 season with semi-professional players having a noticeably higher (though not significant) reporting rate. Analysis indicated that there was a significant association between playing position and concussion reporting with defenders having the greater odds of reporting a concussion than other playing positions. Professional and semi-professional footballers have a relatively equal risk of receiving a concussion. This research is the first major investigation of the self-reported frequency of, and attitudes towards, concussion amongst Irish senior professional and semi-professional footballers. The results have important implications for coaches, clinicians, parents, players and national governing bodies. Further research is needed to ascertain whether professional footballers perceive concussion as an occupational risk, and whether they appreciate that accepting such risks can have long-term implications for health.","This paper investigates the prevalence and attitudes surrounding concussion among professional and semi-professional footballers in Ireland during the 2014 season. It highlights that 15.7% of participants reported experiencing a concussion, with defenders more likely to report such incidents, indicating a need for increased awareness and research on the perception of concussion risks within this athlete population."

Carver, John B. Schrock, Matthew J. Kraeutler, Eric C. McCarty","Background: Previous studies have analyzed the treatment patterns used to manage injuries in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I football players. Hypothesis: Treatment patterns used to manage injuries in NCAA Division I football players will have changed over the study period. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Methods: The head orthopaedic team physicians for all 128 NCAA Division I football teams were asked to complete a survey containing questions regarding experience as team physician, medical coverage of the team, reimbursement issues, and treatment preferences for some of the most common injuries occurring in football players. Responses from the current survey were compared with responses from the same survey sent to NCAA Division I team physicians in 2008. Results: Responses were received from 111 (111/119, 93%) NCAA Division I orthopaedic team physicians in 2008 and 115 (115/128, 90%) orthopaedic team physicians between April 2016 and April 2017. The proportion of team physicians who prefer a patellar tendon autograft for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) increased from 67% in 2008 to 83% in 2016 ( P &lt; 0.001). The proportion of team physicians who perform anterior shoulder stabilization arthroscopically increased from 69% in 2008 to 93% in 2016 ( P &lt; 0.0001). Of team physicians who perform surgery for grade III posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries, the proportion who use the arthroscopic single-bundle technique increased from 49% in 2008 to 83% in 2016 ( P &lt; 0.0001). The proportion of team physicians who use Toradol injections prior to a game to help with nagging injuries decreased from 62% in 2008 to 26% in 2016 ( P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: Orthopaedic physicians changed their injury treatment preferences for NCAA Division I football players over the study period. In particular, physicians have changed their preferred techniques for ACLR, anterior shoulder stabilization, and PCL reconstruction. Physicians have also become more conservative with pregame Toradol injections. Clinical Relevance: These opinions may help guide treatment decisions and lead to better care of all athletes.","This paper analyzes the evolving treatment patterns among NCAA Division I football players by surveying orthopaedic team physicians over a decade. Key findings indicate a significant shift in surgical preferences, particularly for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and shoulder stabilization techniques, as well as a reduction in the use of Toradol injections prior to games."

Padua, Lindsay J. DiStefano, Timothy E. Hewett, William E. Garrett, Stephen W. Marshall, Grace M. Golden, Sandra J. Shultz, Susan M. Sigward","Objective: To provide certified athletic trainers, physicians, and other health care and fitness professionals with recommendations based on current evidence regarding the prevention of noncontact and indirect-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in athletes and physically active individuals. Background: Preventing ACL injuries during sport and physical activity may dramatically decrease medical costs and long-term disability. Implementing ACL injury-prevention training programs may improve an individual's neuromuscular control and lower extremity biomechanics and thereby reduce the risk of injury. Recent evidence indicates that ACL injuries may be prevented through the use of multicomponent neuromuscular-training programs. Recommendations: Multicomponent injury-prevention training programs are recommended for reducing noncontact and indirect-contact ACL injuries and strongly recommended for reducing noncontact and indirect-contact knee injuries during physical activity. These programs are advocated for improving balance, lower extremity biomechanics, muscle activation, functional performance, strength, and power, as well as decreasing landing impact forces. A multicomponent injury-prevention training program should, at minimum, provide feedback on movement technique in at least 3 of the following exercise categories: strength, plyometrics, agility, balance, and flexibility. Further guidance on training dosage, intensity, and implementation recommendations is offered in this statement.","The paper provides evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of noncontact and indirect-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in athletes.

Objective: To determine the effects of a school-based neuromuscular training (NMT) program on sport-related injury incidence across 3 sports at the high school and middle school levels, focusing particularly on knee and ankle injuries. Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting: A total of 5 middle schools and 4 high schools in a single-county public school district. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 474 girls (222 middle school, 252 high school; age = 14.0 ± 1.7 years, height = 161.0 ± 8.1 cm, mass = 55.4 ± 12.2 kg) were cluster randomized to an NMT (CORE; n = 259 athletes) or sham (SHAM; n = 215 athletes) intervention group by team within each sport (basketball, soccer, and volleyball). Intervention(s): The CORE intervention consisted of exercises focused on the trunk and lower extremity, whereas the SHAM protocol consisted of resisted running using elastic bands. Each intervention was implemented at the start of the season and continued until the last competition. An athletic trainer evaluated athletes weekly for sport-related injuries. The coach recorded each athlete-exposure (AE), which was defined as 1 athlete participating in 1 coach-directed session (game or practice). Main Outcome Measure(s): Injury rates were calculated overall, by sport, and by competition level. We also calculated rates of specific knee and ankle injuries. A mixed-model approach was used to account for multiple injuries per athlete. Results: Overall, the CORE group reported 107 injuries (rate = 5.34 injuries/1000 AEs), and the SHAM group reported 134 injuries (rate = 8.54 injuries/1000 AEs; F1,578 = 18.65, P &amp;lt; .001). Basketball (rate = 4.99 injuries/1000 AEs) and volleyball (rate = 5.74 injuries/1000 AEs) athletes in the CORE group demonstrated lower injury incidences than basketball (rate = 7.72 injuries/1000 AEs) and volleyball (rate = 11.63 injuries/1000 AEs; F1,275 = 9.46, P = .002 and F1,149 = 11.36, P = .001, respectively) athletes in the SHAM group.

Career Length and Injury Incidence After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Major League Soccer Players,2018-01-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Amelia Joanna Hanford Arundale, Holly Jacinda Silvers-Granelli, Lynn Snyder-Mackler","Little is known about career length after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in Major League Soccer (MLS), the top men's professional soccer league in the United States. Further, it is unspecified whether athletes returning to soccer after ACL reconstruction are at a higher risk for injuries, beyond new knee injuries.To examine career length and the incidence of lower extremity injuries in MLS athletes after ACL reconstruction in comparison with age-matched controls.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.Injuries and athletic exposures (AEs; games and training sessions) were recorded in the HealtheAthlete database, the injury surveillance system of MLS. All athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction and returned to MLS were identified and age-matched with controls. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to compare career length and percentage of regular/postseason games that athletes started, substituted, or did not play. Generalized linear model regressions were used to examine the injury risk.Athletes in the ACL group had shorter careers (1.3 ± 1.3 years) than those in the control group (2.5 ± 1.3 years) (P < .01), but while they were playing, athletes in the ACL group participated in a similar number of AEs as those in the control group (169.9 ± 129.0 vs 171.6 ± 124.9 AEs, respectively; P = .95). Athletes in the ACL group started fewer regular/postseason games (36.7% ± 34.3% vs 60.1% ± 33.8%, respectively; P < .01) and did not play in more regular/postseason games (47.4% ± 35.5% vs 31.0% ± 34.4%, respectively; P = .03) compared with those in the control group. The ACL group was not at a significantly greater risk for lower extremity injuries compared with the control group (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.55-1.37).Although MLS athletes after ACL reconstruction are not at a greater risk for lower extremity injuries, this study suggests that they are not utilized in regular/postseason games as frequently and that their careers in MLS are shorter than age-matched controls. Further research is necessary to elucidate reasons for these athletes' shortened MLS careers. This study supports the view of return to sport not as a single time point but as a continuum from return to participation to return to play and return to performance.","This paper examines the career length and injury incidence among Major League Soccer players following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The study finds that athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction had shorter careers and started fewer games compared to age-matched controls, although they did not face a significantly higher risk of lower extremity injuries."

Establishing normative data can provide clinicians reference points with which to compare their patients, potentially aiding in the development of future injury-risk assessments and injury-mitigation programs. Objective: To establish normative functional performance and limb-symmetry data for high school-aged male and female athletes in the United States. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Athletic training facilities and gymnasiums across the United States. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 3951 male and female athletes who participated on high school-sponsored basketball, football, lacrosse, or soccer teams enrolled in this nationwide study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Functional performance testing consisted of 3 evaluations. Ankle-joint range of motion, balance, and lower extremity muscular power and landing control were assessed via the weight-bearing ankle-dorsiflexion–lunge, single-legged anterior-reach, and anterior single-legged hop-for-distance (SLHOP) tests, respectively. We used 2-way analyses of variance and χ2 analyses to examine the effects of sex and grade level on ankle-dorsiflexion–lunge, single-legged anterior-reach, and SLHOP test performance and symmetry.

Port","Though sub-concussive impacts are common during contact sports, there is little consensus whether repeat blows affect brain function. Using a ""lifetime exposure"" rather than acute exposure approach, we examined oculomotor performance and brain activation among collegiate football players and two control groups. Our analysis examined whether there are group differences in eye movement behavioral performance and in brain activation during smooth pursuit. Data from 21 off-season Division I football ""starters"" were compared with a) 19 collegiate cross-country runners, and b) 11 non-athlete college students who were SES matched to the football player group (total N = 51). Visual smooth pursuit was performed while undergoing fMRI imaging via a 3 Tesla scanner. Smooth pursuit eye movements to three stimulus difficulty levels were measured with regard to RMS error, gain, and lag. No meaningful differences were found for any of the standard analyses used to assess smooth pursuit eye movements. For fMRI, greater activation was seen in the oculomotor region of the cerebellar vermis and areas of the FEF for football players as compared to either control group, who did not differ on any measure. Greater cerebellar activity among football players while performing an oculomotor task could indicate that they are working harder to compensate for some subtle, long-term subconcussive deficits. Alternatively, top athletes in a sport requiring high visual motor skill could have more of their cerebellum and FEF devoted to oculomotor task performance regardless of subconcussive history. Overall, these results provide little firm support for an effect of accumulated subconcussion exposure on brain function.","This paper investigates the effects of lifetime exposure to sub-concussive impacts on oculomotor performance and brain activation during smooth pursuit eye movements in collegiate football players compared to non-contact athletes and non-athletes.

The Influence of Additional Surface on Force Platform’s Ground Reaction Force Data During Walking and Running,2018-01-01,Science Publishing Group,American Journal of Sports Science,Shariman Ismadi Ismail,"This study compares the vertical ground reaction force exerted from walking and running movement on two different surfaces of a force platform. Five skilled male futsal players were recruited to perform the walking and running tasks over the force platform. In the first setting, the players moved directly in contact with the force platform’s bare surface while in the second setting, the players performed the same tasks on the force platform covered with a typical futsal pitch surface material. The force from the peak heel and peak forefoot strikes were recorded and used for further analysis. A paired t-test was conducted for comparison and the results indicated that there are no significant differences between the two force platform conditions in terms of the magnitude of peak heel strike and peak forefoot strike forces during walking and running. Results also showed that there is a significant difference (p<0.05) on the ratio of the heel and forefoot strike peak force during walking task (1.05 in force platform bare surface, 0.99 in force platform + futsal court surface). While the data obtained in this study suggests that an additional surface on the force plate has no significant effect on the magnitudes of vertical ground reaction force data, there were indeed some changes that occurred on the heel/forefoot strike force ratio in walking task. The result might suggest that an additional surface (futsal court material) on the force platform has some impacts on the movement pattern of the foot during walking task due to the different conditions of the shoe’s outsole-flooring surface interaction.","This paper investigates the effects of different surface materials on the vertical ground reaction forces during walking and running among skilled futsal players. The findings indicate that while the magnitude of peak forces remains unaffected by the surface type, there is a significant difference in the ratio of heel to forefoot strike forces during walking, suggesting that the surface may influence foot movement patterns."
Kicking ability and kicking deficit in young elite soccer players,2018-01-01,"Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb",Kinesiology,"Lois Rodríguez-Lorenzo, Miguel Fernández-Del Olmo, José Andrés Sánchez-Molina, Rafael Martín-Acero","Kicking ability in soccer has been evaluated predominantly by the maximum ball velocity. The kicking deficit (KD) may be defined as the percentage of the difference between the maximum ball velocity each player achieved by the non-preferred leg kick in relation to the preferred leg kick. This study aimed to compare: side-to-side kicking velocity, vertical jumps and anthropometrics between the younger (G-14) and older (G+14) than 14 years soccer players. An additional aim was to investigate associations among these variables. Participants were 92 young elite soccer players from the development programme of a top Spanish division club. They were divided into two age groups according to their growth and motor development stages (10.80-13.55 years, n=46; 14.02-16.39 years, n=46). Student’s t-test showed that the maximum kicking velocity with the preferred and non-preferred leg, jumping performance, and all anthropometric measurements were significantly (p&amp;lt;.01) higher in G+14 compared with G-14. In contrast, KD values remained stable (15.31%- 15.83%) without significant differences between the groups. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed that vertical jump tests and anthropometric measurements correlated with kicking ball velocity produced by the preferred and non-preferred leg. Our results demonstrate that kicking skills are still not consolidated and power factors may be determinant for kicking performance in young soccer players. In addition, the KD may be a constant element for both the under and above 14 years soccer players and could result from an unequal and greater use of the preferred leg in comparison with the non-preferred leg.","This study examines kicking ability differences in young elite soccer players by comparing side-to-side kicking velocities, vertical jumps, and anthropometric data across two age groups, under and over 14 years. The findings indicate that while older players demonstrate higher maximized kicking velocities, vertical jump performance, and anthropometric measurements, the kicking deficit remains consistent across both age groups, suggesting that factors related to power may influence kicking performance rather than maturity alone."
Study of soccer ball flight trajectory,2018-01-01,EDP Sciences,MATEC Web of Conferences,"Juliana Javorova, Anastas Ivanov","In this paper the trajectories of a soccer ball for the most important kicks in the football game - a corner kick and a direct free kick are studied. The soccer ball is modelled as an ideal rigid hollow spherical body with six degrees of freedom, which performs a general motion in an immovable air environment with constant parameters. The ball 3D orientation is determined by the three Cardan angles. The aerodynamic forces and moments with which the air environment acts to the ball are taken into account. Two of the most dangerous areas of the football goal are defined. Differential equations which describe the motion of the soccer ball are solved numerically by MatLab-Simulink.","This paper examines the flight trajectory of a soccer ball during critical kicks, specifically corner kicks and direct free kicks.

Effect of the 11+ injury prevention programme on fundamental movement patterns in soccer players,2018-01-01,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Ezequiel Rey, Alexis Padrón-Cabo, Erik Penedo-Jamardo, Sixto González-Víllora","No studies have assessed whether changes in an individual's fundamental movement patterns can be achieved with the 11+ prevention programme in soccer players. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the 11+ compared with a standard warm-up on fundamental movement patterns using the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) in amateur male soccer players. Twenty-three male soccer players (age: 24.7±.3.8 years; height: 1.77±0.58 m; body mass: 73.9±6.2 kg) were randomly assigned to the 11+ (n= 12) or control (n= 11) group. The intervention programme had to be carried out 3 times a week over 6 weeks. The 11+ warm-up lasted ~25 minutes and was conducted before starting regular practice, replacing the team's standard warm-up. The control group warmed up with standard jogging, ball exercises, and active stretching to match the duration of the 11+. Within-group analysis revealed significant improvements in the FMS total score in the 11+ (+10.51%; d= 0.83) and control group (+7.99%; d= 0.68) from pre-test to post-test. In the between-group analysis, there were no significant differences between groups. At the post-test a significantly greater number of players in the 11+ group exhibited a score that improved to above the injury threshold (≤14) (p= 0.046). This study suggests that regular implementation of the 11+ injury prevention programme may not produce additional improvements in fundamental movement patterns other than those produced by a standard warm-up.","This study investigates the effectiveness of the 11+ injury prevention programme on the fundamental movement patterns of amateur male soccer players compared to a standard warm-up. While both groups showed significant improvements in their movement patterns, the 11+ programme did not yield greater benefits than the control warm-up, indicating that it may not be necessary for enhancing fundamental movement patterns beyond standard practices."

Players use lofstrand crutches to move around the field and kick the ball. Scoring quick goals during a match requires players to have maximum running skills. Notably, a few parameters affect the running speed in players; however, no study has reported the biomechanical analysis of running in amputee soccer. Thus study aimed to analyze the biomechanics of single-leg running using lofstrand crutches in 12 healthy adult males (6 with prior amputee soccer experience and 6 without such experience). [Participants and Methods] The kinematics of the lower limb and the pelvis, the ground reaction force, and skill in using the crutches were evaluated using 3 dimensional motion analysis combined with 8 force plates. Lower leg amputation was simulated in all participants by maintaining the non-dominant knee in a position of maximum flexion using an elastic band. [Results] Significant differences were observed between experienced and non-experienced participants with regard to the angle of the pelvis and the crutch stance phase. Specifically, higher running speed was associated with an increased forward tilt of the pelvis and a shorter crutch stance phase.

Artificial neural networks in knee injury risk evaluation among professional football players,2018-01-01,Author(s),AIP Conference Proceedings,"Michałowska Martyna, Walczak Tomasz, Grabski Jakub Krzysztof, Grygorowicz Monika","Lower limb injury risk assessment was proposed, based on isokinetic examination that is a part of standard athlete's biomechanical evaluation performed mainly twice a year. Information about non-contact knee injury (or lack of the injury) sustained within twelve months after isokinetic test, confirmed in USG were verified. Three the most common types of football injuries were taken into consideration: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, hamstring and quadriceps muscles injuries. 22 parameters, obtained from isokinetic tests were divided into 4 groups and used as input parameters of five feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). The 5th group consisted of all considered parameters. The networks were trained with the use of Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm to return value close to 1 for the sets of parameters corresponding injury event and close to 0 for parameters with no injury recorded within 6 - 12 months after isokinetic test. Results of this study shows that ANN might be useful tools, which simplify process of simultaneous interpretation of many numerical parameters, but the most important factor that significantly influence the results is database used for ANN training.","This paper explores the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to assess the risk of lower limb injuries, particularly non-contact knee injuries, in professional football players through isokinetic examinations.

THE MANAGEMENT OF TURF TOE – A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,2018-01-01,Lithuanian Sports University,Baltic Journal of Sport and Health Sciences,"Louis Hainsworth, John McKinley","Background. Turf toe is used to describe an injury occurring at the plantar aspect of the metatarsophalangeal- sesamoid complex of the hallux. Typically seen in athletes, it occurs due to hyperdorsiflexion and axial loading of the hallux metatarsophalangeal joint with the foot fixed in equinus. The injury causes pain and joint instability, missed athletic activity and potentially end careers. Turf toe can be managed conservatively or operatively, with controversy regarding the indications for operative intervention. This study aims to conduct a systematic review to determine whether and in what circumstances operative intervention is superior to conservative management of turf toe in adults. Methods. A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Scopus databases. The search terms used were “turf toe”, “first metatarsophalangeal joint injury”, “conservative”, “nonoperative”, and “operative”. All articles published in English reporting on the management of turf toe were reviewed. The primary outcome measure was the time to return to pre-injury activity with the secondary outcome of the time to symptom resolution. Results. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Three patients were successfully managed conservatively returning to athletic activity, on average at 12 weeks. Seventeen patients underwent surgical intervention with an average return to athletic activity at 18 weeks. Conclusion. Operative intervention was shown to give a successful outcome in patients with grade three turf toe injuries or those who have failed conservative management. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether operative intervention is superior to conservative management.","This paper conducts a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of conservative versus operative management of turf toe, an injury commonly affecting athletes at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux. The findings suggest that while surgical intervention may be beneficial for severe cases or those unresponsive to conservative treatment, there is not enough evidence to definitively prefer one approach over the other."
A Study on the Dynamic Analysis of the Kicking Leg during the Instep Kick,2018-01-01,Korean Society of Precision Engineering,Journal of the Korean Society for Precision Engineering,"Junhyeok Park, Sukyung Park","In soccer, sports science aims to prevent injuries and improve performance by biomechanically analyzing a series of the kick processes. In order to understand the kick processes biomechanically, studies on kinematic, kinetic, and EMG have been conducted. However, these studies have limitations due to absence of integrated theory defining interactions between the segments. In the present work, we propose a model to understand dynamic characteristics of the kicking leg based on the biomechanical features of the instep kick. Five healthy men participated in an experiment to perform four-level instep kick. We collected kinematic and kinetic information of the hip and knee joints. Based on the passive dominance of the knee joint, we devised the knee joint torque model proportional to angle and angular velocity. RMSE between simulated and real torque was 4.17%, and exhibited a tendency to decrease linearly with the kick speed. Henceforth, it is apparent that the faster the kick, the greater the load on the hip; and the slower the kick, the greater the load on the knee joint. We anticipate that this model will be applied to the kick monitoring equipment and for the prevention of injuries by measuring the load.","This paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of the kicking leg during the instep kick in soccer by analyzing kinematic and kinetic data from a series of experiments. It proposes a knee joint torque model to understand the mechanical loads during different kick speeds, highlighting the relationship between kick velocity and stress on the hip and knee joints, with implications for injury prevention and performance monitoring."

Effect of Variable-Intensity Running Training and Circuit Training on Selected Physiological Parameters of Soccer Players,2018-01-01,University of Szczecin,Central European Journal of Sport Sciences and Medicine,"Tadeusz Ambroży, Mateusz Nowak, Jarosław Omorczyk, Krzysztof Wrześniewski, Mariusz Ozimek, Henryk Duda, Dawid Mucha, Piotr Ceranowicz, Tomasz Pałka, Arkadiusz Stanula, Dariusz Mucha","Proper planning of the training process based on individual LT and AT metabolic thresholds is essential to improve athletic performance. Development of endurance in soccer players is mainly based on continuous runs and variable-intensity runs, supplemented with strength conditioning and sport-specific training. The aim of the study was to analyse selected parameters of physical capacity of soccer players after 8-week variable-intensity running training and circuit training. The experiment was carried out in a group of 34 soccer players aged 21 to 26 years. The athletes were divided into two groups: 17 people in the experimental group and 17 people in the control group. The experimental group was involved in 30-minute tempo runs two times a week for 8 weeks with variable intensity at AT. In the same period, the control group performed two 60-minute continuous runs at the intensity of 70-75%HRmax. The determination of metabolic thresholds used two indirect tests: the multistage shuttle run test (beep test) and maximal lactate steady state test (MLSS) with author's own modification. In order to evaluate maximal heart rate (HRmax), the research procedure was started from the beep test (distance: 20 m). The speed at the first level was 8.5 km/h and increased with each level by 0.5 km/h. Training of the experimental group where variable exercise intensity was used caused a statistically significant increase in HRmax (by 1.9%) and blood lactate levels at the AT (by 20.5%). The training in the experimental group led to the statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in the parameters of the following variables: HRmax (by 1.9%); lactate level (by 7.85); HR at the AT (by 1,9%); lactate level at the AT (by 20.5%). The assumptions of the experimental training did not cause statistically significant changes in pretest vs. posttest HRmax and blood lactate levels for the LT. Endurance training with high intensity is more effective in soccer players compared to training with moderate intensity. Development of special endurance in soccer should also assume the intensity and method of working similar to the method used during sport competition.","The paper investigates the impact of variable-intensity running training and circuit training on the physiological parameters of soccer players over an 8-week period. The study finds that high-intensity training significantly improves heart rate maximum and blood lactate levels compared to traditional moderate-intensity running, highlighting the importance of tailored endurance training for enhancing athletic performance in soccer."

Analysis of head impacts at different helmet locations during a collision with strain gauge signals,2018-01-01,Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers,The Proceedings of the Symposium on sports and human dynamics,"Takashi FUKUDA, Sekiya KOIKE, Shumpei MIYAKAWA, Hiroto Fujiya","American football (AF) is characterized as a collision sport and it has been reported that there are a lot of injuries including catastrophic injuries. Many reports state that head injury has occurred in about 10% of the whole, and especially the incidence of a brain concussion is very high. Biomechanics research to analyze a mechanism of the brain concussion by video analysis has been done since the 1960s. Then, several collision experiments to investigate the linear and rotational accelerations acting in the head during a collision in the actual field have been conducted since 2003. However, it is unclear how much the impact force is acting on a head itself by using an acceleration sensor. Thus, we have constructed a digital filter estimating the head action force with a new method using a strain gauge although the digital filter was obtained from only one location of the head. In addition, we should consider the force on an outer shell of the helmet and the force buffered by the inner pads separately because the head action force at the time of collision is attenuated by inner pads inside the helmet. For this reason, when considering the head acting force, it is necessary to consider the force acting on the outer shell of the helmet and the force buffered by the inner pad. The purpose of this study was to verify the measurement method of constructing a digital filter by using strain gauges attached to the front and back surfaces of an acrylic board.",This paper investigates head impacts in American football by utilizing a strain gauge method to measure the forces acting on the head during collisions.

A Novel Method for Assessment of Proprioception,2018-01-01,"The Journal of Emerging Investigators, Inc.",Journal of Emerging Investigators,"Alexander Trevithick, Susan Y Park","Proprioception is the sense of the relative position of body parts and movement, as detected by mechanoreceptors located in muscles, joints, and fascia throughout the body. Various attempts have been made to quantify this sensory function. Furthermore, its impairment has been documented in humans with viral infection that specifically damages proprioceptive neurons of the central nervous system. To test the proprioceptive acuity of high school athletes, we sought to establish a quantitative assessment of proprioception. In this study, we hypothesized that varsity-level athletes would have a superior sense of body positioning and thus perform better than non-varsity athletes, irrespective of sport. A novel approach was developed that utilizes two motor tasks of shoulder-arm positioning: arm placement at defined clock-face positions and random radial arm movement on an x,y plane. Using these quantitative methods, we provide a ‘proprioceptive index’ for each athlete as a measure of sensory integration and motor output. Participants were grouped by participation in sports: soccer, hockey, basketball, or dance. We found a significant correlation between dancers and their ability to precisely reproduce motor movements.","The paper presents a novel method for quantitatively assessing proprioception among high school athletes, focusing on their ability to perceive body positioning. It establishes a 'proprioceptive index' derived from motor tasks and finds that athletes in specific sports, particularly dancers, demonstrate enhanced proprioceptive acuity compared to non-varsity athletes."

The functional movement assessments chosen may not be sensitive enough to detect neurological and neuromuscular differences within the sample and subtle changes after sustaining head impacts.","This study investigates the predictive ability of functional movement assessments for head impact biomechanics in college football players, specifically examining how these assessments relate to changes in performance over a season. The findings indicate that preseason movement quality does not significantly influence head impact outcomes or score changes in the functional assessments used."
A biomechanical comparison of countermovement performance after short-term traditional and daily-undulated loaded vertical jump training,2017-12-29,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Thiemo Pelzer, Boris Ullrich, Stefan Endler, Christian Rasche, Mark Pfeiffer","In order to assess lower extremity muscle mechanical properties in athletes, power-load characteristics during multi-joint tasks are frequently examined. This work compared 6 weeks of traditional (TP) and daily-undulated (DUP) periodized loaded countermovement jumping (CMJ). 20 amateur athletes (age: 24.2 ± 2.6 years, height: 175.6 ± 7.1 cm, body mass: 71.5 ± 7.7 kg, 10 males/10 females) exercised three times weekly using maximal CMJs with loads corresponding to 0%, 15% and 30% of body mass. Prior to the training period, subjects were once-only assigned by random to either the TP or DUP training scheme. Pre-to-post training, maximal center of mass (COM) -height, -take-off velocity, -power output and -impulse were compared during CMJ with additional loads corresponding to 0-30% of body mass. ANOVA (time * group) with repeated measures revealed significant (P < 0.05) temporal gains of maximal COM-height (2-11%), -take-off velocity (1-7%), -power (2-8%) and -impulse (3-9%) over most loading conditions for TP and DUP. However, ANOVA indicated no group effects for any outcome. Independent from the periodization model, maximal power output remained statistically unchanged with increased testing loads. For short-term conditioning periods, TP and DUP were equally effective in enhancing biomechanical jumping variables under varying loading conditions.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of two training methods—traditional periodization (TP) and daily-undulated periodization (DUP)—on countermovement jump performance in amateur athletes over six weeks. The findings indicate that both training schemes significantly improved variables such as maximal center of mass height, take-off velocity, power output, and impulse, yet showed no differences in effectiveness between the two methods."
Relationships Between the External and Internal Training Load in Professional Soccer: What Can We Learn From Machine Learning?,2017-12-28,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Arne Jaspers, Tim Op De Beéck, Michel S. Brink, Wouter G.P. Frencken, Filip Staes, Jesse J. Davis, Werner F. Helsen","Purpose : Machine learning may contribute to understanding the relationship between the external load and internal load in professional soccer. Therefore, the relationship between external load indicators (ELIs) and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was examined using machine learning techniques on a group and individual level. Methods : Training data were collected from 38 professional soccer players over 2 seasons. The external load was measured using global positioning system technology and accelerometry. The internal load was obtained using the RPE. Predictive models were constructed using 2 machine learning techniques, artificial neural networks and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models, and 1 naive baseline method. The predictions were based on a large set of ELIs. Using each technique, 1 group model involving all players and 1 individual model for each player were constructed. These models’ performance on predicting the reported RPE values for future training sessions was compared with the naive baseline’s performance. Results : Both the artificial neural network and LASSO models outperformed the baseline. In addition, the LASSO model made more accurate predictions for the RPE than did the artificial neural network model. Furthermore, decelerations were identified as important ELIs. Regardless of the applied machine learning technique, the group models resulted in equivalent or better predictions for the reported RPE values than the individual models. Conclusions : Machine learning techniques may have added value in predicting RPE for future sessions to optimize training design and evaluation. These techniques may also be used in conjunction with expert knowledge to select key ELIs for load monitoring.","This paper investigates the relationship between external load indicators and internal training load in professional soccer using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates that both artificial neural networks and LASSO models can accurately predict perceived exertion ratings, with LASSO showing superior performance, and emphasizes the importance of deceleration as a key external load indicator for optimizing training."
Functional Screening Tests: Interrelationships and Ability to Predict Vertical Jump Performance,2017-12-28,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Irineu Loturco, Lucas Pereira, Ronaldo Kobal, Cesar Abad, William Komatsu, Ronaldo Cunha, Gustavo Arliani, Benno Ejnisman, Alberto de Castro Pochini, Fábio Nakamura, Moises Cohen","Abstract There are several methods used in sports science to identify asymmetries in athletes, given their purported relevance to injury prevention and performance optimization. We aimed to verify whether asymmetries provided by isokinetic assessments, jump tests, and tensiomyography (TMG) are associated with each other, and whether their respective functional indices are related to jumping ability. TMG parameters, unilateral and bilateral squat-jump (SJ) and countermovement-jump (CMJ) performances, and peak torque in knee-extension and flexion with angular velocities of 60o/s and 300o/s for twenty-four soccer players were retained for analyses. Asymmetry was detected by examining the percentage difference between dominant and non-dominant legs. The median-split technique was used to identify the best and worst performers in SJ and CMJ tests. Results revealed that the asymmetries detected in the three different methods were not interrelated. Curiously, better performances in SJ and CMJ tests were associated with higher asymmetry levels. Furthermore, only the knee-extension peak torque at both angular velocities was correlated moderately to largely (r=0.48-0.66) with jump performance. Despite their recognized ability to predict the risk of injury, the absence of interrelationships between TMG, isokinetic tests, and unilateral jumps precludes their single use as a unique functional screening diagnostic. Finally, and very importantly, lower-limb asymmetry is not necessarily related to impaired vertical jump performance in soccer players.","This paper investigates the interrelationships among various functional screening tests, including isokinetic assessments, jump tests, and tensiomyography (TMG), in relation to vertical jump performance in soccer players. The findings indicate that while asymmetries detected by these methods are not interrelated, higher asymmetry levels were associated with better jump performances, suggesting that lower-limb asymmetry does not necessarily impair vertical jump ability."
Investigating the influence of intraindividual changes in perceived stress symptoms on injury risk in soccer,2017-12-28,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"D. Clement, A. Ivarsson, U. Tranaeus, U. Johnson, A. Stenling","Research has shown that high levels of stress and stress responsivity can increase the risk of injuries. However, most of the research that has supported this notion has focused on between‐person relationships, ignoring the relationships at the within‐person level. As a result, the objective of this study was to investigate if within‐person changes in perceived stress symptoms over a 1‐month time period could predict injury rates during the subsequent 3 months. A prospective design with two measurement points (Time 1—at the beginning of the season and Time 2—1 month into the season) was utilized. A total of 121 competitive soccer players (85 males and 36 females; M age = 18.39, SD = 3.08) from Sweden and the United States completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale ( KPDS ) and a demographic sheet at Time 1. The KPDS was also completed at Time 2, and all acute injuries that occurred during the subsequent 3‐month period were recorded. A Bayesian latent change scores model was used to determine whether within‐person changes in stress symptoms could predict the risk of injury. Results revealed that there was a credible positive effect of changes in stress symptoms on injury rates, indicating that an increase in reported stress symptoms was related to an increased risk for injury. This finding highlights the importance of creating caring and supportive sporting environments and relationships and teaching stress management techniques, especially during the earlier portion of competitive seasons, to possibly reduce the occurrence of injuries.","The paper investigates the within-person relationship between perceived stress symptoms and injury risk in soccer players over a three-month period. It finds that increases in perceived stress symptoms are associated with a higher risk of injury, suggesting the need for supportive environments and stress management techniques in competitive sports settings."
Physiological and Physical Responses According to the Game Surface in a Soccer Simulation Protocol,2017-12-28,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Jorge López-Fernández, Javier Sánchez-Sánchez, Jorge García-Unanue, José Luis Felipe, Enrique Colino, Leonor Gallardo","Purpose : Recent studies have shown that soccer players’ responses are similar on natural grass (NG) and artificial turf (AT), but they did not control the mechanical properties of these surfaces. This work aimed to analyze the influence of the game surface on amateur soccer players’ physical and physiological responses using a soccer simulation protocol. Methods : A total of 16 amateur players performed 3 bouts of the soccer simulation protocol on AT, and, on another day, 3 bouts on NG. The mechanical properties of both surfaces were recorded. The order of surfaces was randomly established for each participant. Physiological responses of players were assessed before and after the 6-repeated-sprints test existing at the midpoint of each bout. Fatigue (% best; % diff) and general variables (total time; best time, mean time; maximum speed) for both the repeated sprint test (RST) and the agility tests (nonlinear actions at maximum speed) incorporated into the soccer simulation protocol were also analyzed. Results : The 2 surfaces displayed different mechanical properties. Physical responses were found similar for both surfaces ( P &gt; .05) before and after the RST. There were no surface differences in sprint times or fatigue variables for the RST ( P &gt; .05). The agility test was faster on AT than on NG in bout 1 (average speed [+1.17 km/h; P = .037]; agility test cut time [−0.31 s; P = .027] and best time [−0.52 s; P = .042]). Conclusions : The differences in the mechanical properties of the 2 surfaces are not sufficient to cause differences in the physiological and physical responses of soccer players, although they may affect turns and cuts.","This paper investigates the physiological and physical responses of amateur soccer players on natural grass (NG) versus artificial turf (AT) using a soccer simulation protocol.

Age Influences Biomechanical Changes After Participation in an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Prevention Program,2017-12-27,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Julie A. Thompson-Kolesar, Corey T. Gatewood, Andrew A. Tran, Amy Silder, Rebecca Shultz, Scott L. Delp, Jason L. Dragoo","Background: The prevalence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries increases during maturation and peaks during late adolescence. Previous studies suggested an age-related association between participation in injury prevention programs and reduction of ACL injury. However, few studies have investigated differences in biomechanical changes after injury prevention programs between preadolescent and adolescent athletes. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to investigate the influence of age on the effects of the FIFA Medical and Research Centre (F-MARC) 11+ injury prevention warm-up program on differences in biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury between preadolescent and adolescent female soccer players. It was hypothesized that the ACL injury risk factors of knee valgus angle and moment would be greater at baseline but would improve more after training for preadolescent athletes than adolescent athletes. It was further hypothesized that flexor-extensor muscle co-contraction would increase after training for both preadolescent and adolescent athletes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Institutional Review Board–approved written consent was obtained for 51 preadolescent female athletes aged 10 to 12 years (intervention: n = 28, 11.8 ± 0.8 years; control: n = 23, 11.2 ± 0.6 years) and 43 adolescent female athletes aged 14 to 18 years (intervention: n = 22, 15.9 ± 0.9 years; control: n = 21, 15.7 ± 1.1 years). The intervention groups participated in 15 in-season sessions of the F-MARC 11+ program 2 times per week. Pre- and postseason motion capture data were collected during 4 tasks: preplanned cutting, unanticipated cutting, double-legged jump, and single-legged jump. Lower extremity joint angles and moments were estimated through biomechanical modeling. Knee flexor-extensor muscle co-contraction was estimated from surface electromyography. Results: At baseline, preadolescent athletes displayed greater initial contact and peak knee valgus angles during all activities when compared with the adolescent athletes, but knee valgus moment was not significantly different between age groups. After intervention training, preadolescent athletes improved and decreased their initial contact knee valgus angle (–1.24° ± 0.36°; P = .036) as well as their peak knee valgus moment (–0.57 ± 0.27 percentage body weight × height; P = .033) during the double-legged jump task, as compared with adolescent athletes in the intervention. Compared with adolescent athletes, preadolescent athletes displayed higher weight acceptance flexor-extensor muscle co-contraction at baseline during all activities ( P &lt; .05). After intervention training, preadolescent athletes displayed an increase in precontact flexor-extensor muscle co-contraction during preplanned cutting as compared with adolescent intervention athletes (0.07 ± 0.02 vs –0.30 ± 0.27, respectively; P = .002). Conclusion: The F-MARC 11+ program may be more effective at improving some risk factors for ACL injury among preadolescent female athletes than adolescent athletes, notably by reducing knee valgus angle and moment during a double-legged jump landing. Clinical Relevance: ACL prevention programs may be more effective if administered early in an athlete’s career, as younger athletes may be more likely to adapt new biomechanical movement patterns.","This paper investigates the impact of age on biomechanical changes resulting from the FIFA Medical and Research Centre (F-MARC) 11+ injury prevention program in preadolescent and adolescent female soccer players. The study finds that preadolescent athletes show more significant improvements in ACL injury risk factors, specifically in knee valgus angle and moment, after participating in the program compared to their adolescent counterparts."

Wearable sensors can measure impact exposure, yet current sensors do not have validated impact detection methods for accurate exposure monitoring. Here we demonstrate a head impact detection method that can be implemented on a wearable sensor for detecting field football head impacts. Our method incorporates a support vector machine classifier that uses biomechanical features from the time domain and frequency domain, as well as model predictions of head-neck motions. The classifier was trained and validated using instrumented mouthguard data from collegiate football games and practices, with ground truth data labels established from video review. We found that low frequency power spectral density and wavelet transform features (10~30 Hz) were the best performing features. From forward feature selection, fewer than ten features optimized classifier performance, achieving 87.2% sensitivity and 93.2% precision in cross-validation on the collegiate dataset (n = 387), and over 90% sensitivity and precision on an independent youth dataset (n = 32). Accurate head impact detection is essential for studying and monitoring head impact exposure on the field, and the approach in the current paper may help to improve impact detection performance on wearable sensors.","The paper discusses a method for detecting head impacts in American football using wearable sensors and a support vector machine classifier that leverages biomechanical features.

METHODS Eight coaches inserted in an Elite Football Club participated. Rappaport Time Line and semi-structured interviews were used to obtain the data. The coaches’ learning was organized according to the theory of Lifelong Learning.1-4 RESULTS The coaches presented in their personal experiences, with their families and as athletes, content of learning such as “leadership development” and “formation of values”. In professional experiences, such as in academic training, coach assistants and even coaching, they are also reported as essential in obtaining content of learning (general and specific knowledge, training methods, leadership development, self-control). Finally, the reflexive process is considered by most coaches as a potentiator of learning, with interference on the “coach-athlete relationship”, “activity adjustment,” among other content of learning. CONCLUSION The content learned throughout the life were defined in certain episodes for presenting different meanings in the life of the coaches, in which they related to a new experience according to their biographies. Therefore, the various episodes offer coaches new experiences, in which they can incorporate, reinforce or renew the content about the coaching process and are responsible for the development of the coach.","This paper analyzes the lifelong learning experiences of football coaches in Brazil, focusing on the various content they acquire throughout their careers.

Discussion about different cut-off values of conventional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio used in hamstring injury prediction among professional male football players,2017-12-07,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Monika Grygorowicz, Martyna Michałowska, Tomasz Walczak, Adam Owen, Jakub Krzysztof Grabski, Andrzej Pyda, Tomasz Piontek, Tomasz Kotwicki","To measure the sensitivity and specificity of differences cut-off values for isokinetic Hcon/Qcon ratio in order to improve the capacity to evaluate (retrospectively) the injury of hamstring muscles in professional soccer screened with knee isokinetic tests.Retrospective study.Medical and biomechanical data of professional football players playing for the same team for at least one season between 2010 and 2016 were analysed. Hamstring strain injury cases and the reports generated via isokinetic testing were investigated. Isokinetic concentric(con) hamstring(H) and quadriceps(Q) absolute strength in addition with Hcon/Qcon ratio were examined for the injured versus uninjured limbs among injured players, and for the injured and non-injured players. 2 x 2 contingency table was used for comparing variables: predicted injured or predicted uninjured with actual injured or actual uninjured. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratio were calculated for three different cut-off values (0.47 vs. 0.6 vs. 0.658) to compare the discriminative power of an isokinetic test, whilst examining the key value of Hcon/Qcon ratio which may indicate the highest level of ability to predispose a player to injury. McNemar's chi2 test with Yates's correction was used to determine agreement between the tests. PQStat software was used for all statistical analysis, and an alpha level of p <0.05 was used for all statistical comparisons.340 isokinetic test reports on both limbs of 66 professional soccer players were analysed. Eleven players suffered hamstring injuries during the analysed period. None of these players sustained recurrence of hamstring injury. One player sustained hamstring strain injury on both legs, thus the total number of injuries was 12. Application of different cut-off values for Hcon/Qcon significantly affected the sensitivity and specificity of isokinetic test used as a tool for muscle injury detection. The use of 0.47 of Hcon/Qcon as a discriminate value resulted in significantly lower sensitivity when compared to 0.658 threshold (sensitivity of 16.7% vs. 91.7%, respectively; t = 6.125,p = 0.0133). Calculated values of specificity (when three different cut-off were applied) were also significantly different. Threshold of 0.6 of Hcon/Qcon resulted with significantly lower specificity compared to 0.47 value (specificity of 46.9% vs. 94.5%, respectively; t = 153.0,p<0.0001), and significantly higher specificity when compared to 0.658 (specificity of 46.9% vs. 24.1%, respectively; t = 229.0, p<0.0001).The use of different cut-off values for Hcon/Qcon significantly affected the sensitivity and specificity of isokinetic testing. The interpretation of usefulness of isokinetic test as a screening tool in a group of male professional football players to predict hamstring injury occurrence within the next 12 months might be therefore significantly biased due to the different threshold values of Hcon/Qcon. Using one ""normative"" value as a cut-off (e.g. 0.47 or 0.60, or 0.658) to quantify soccer players (or not) to the group with a higher risk of knee injury might result in biased outcomes due to the natural strength asymmetry that is observed within the group of soccer players.","This paper investigates the impact of varying cut-off values of the hamstring-to-quadriceps (Hcon/Qcon) ratio on the sensitivity and specificity of isokinetic tests used to predict hamstring injuries in professional male football players.

Given the particular biomedical and biomechanical application, the device requires the highest sensitivity achievable with a single proof mass approach, where basically all three axes of measurements are detected with a single mass suspended by surrounding beams. Moreover, a very low error, below 1%, is expected for these types of applications where accuracy is paramount. The optimization method differs from previous work as it is based on the progressive increment of the sensor mass moment of inertia (MMI) in all three axes. The work numerically demonstrates the hypothesis that an increment of MMI determines an increment of device sensitivity with a simultaneous reduction of cross-talk in the particular axis under study. A final optimal shape is selected as the best possible output of the optimization process and the final device shows a sensitivity increase of about 80% in the Z-axis and a reduction of cross-talk of 18% with respect to state-of-art sensors available in the literature. Sensor design, modelling and optimization are presented, concluding the work with results, discussion and conclusion. © 2027 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Analysis of the Hamstring Muscle Activation During two Injury Prevention Exercises,2017-12-02,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Alireza Monajati, Eneko Larumbe-Zabala, Mark Goss-Sampson, Fernando Naclerio","The aim of this study was to perform an electromyographic and kinetic comparison of two commonly used hamstring eccentric strengthening exercises: Nordic Curl and Ball Leg Curl. After determining the maximum isometric voluntary contraction of the knee flexors, ten female athletes performed 3 repetitions of both the Nordic Curl and Ball Leg Curl, while knee angular displacement and electromyografic activity of the biceps femoris and semitendinosus were monitored. No significant differences were found between biceps femoris and semitendinosus activation in both the Nordic Curl and Ball Leg Curl. However, comparisons between exercises revealed higher activation of both the biceps femoris (74.8 ± 20 vs 50.3 ± 25.7%, p = 0.03 d = 0.53) and semitendinosus (78.3 ± 27.5 vs 44.3 ± 26.6%, p = 0.012, d = 0.63) at the closest knee angles in the Nordic Curl vs Ball Leg Curl, respectively. Hamstring muscles activation during the Nordic Curl increased, remained high (>70%) between 60 to 40° of the knee angle and then decreased to 27% of the maximal isometric voluntary contraction at the end of movement. Overall, the biceps femoris and semitendinosus showed similar patterns of activation. In conclusion, even though the hamstring muscle activation at open knee positions was similar between exercises, the Nordic Curl elicited a higher hamstring activity compared to the Ball Leg Curl.","This study compares hamstring muscle activation during two eccentric strengthening exercises, the Nordic Curl and Ball Leg Curl, using electromyographic and kinetic analysis.

Clinical Factors That Predict a Second ACL Injury After ACL Reconstruction and Return to Sport: Preliminary Development of a Clinical Decision Algorithm,2017-12-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Mark V. Paterno, Bin Huang, Staci Thomas, Timothy E. Hewett, Laura C. Schmitt","Biomechanical predictors of a second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and return to sport (RTS) have been identified; however, these measures may not be feasible in a standard clinical environment.The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether standard clinical measures predicted the risk of second ACL injuries. The hypothesis tested was that a combination of strength, function, and patient-reported measures at the time of RTS would predict the risk of second ACL injuries with high sensitivity and specificity.Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3 and Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 1.A total of 163 participants (mean age, 16.7 ± 3.0 years) who underwent primary ACLR and were able to RTS were evaluated. All participants completed an assessment of isokinetic strength, hop testing, balance, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Participants were tracked for a minimum of 24 months to identify occurrences of a second ACL injury. The initial 120 participants enrolled were used to develop a clinical prediction model that utilized classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and the remaining 43 participants enrolled were used as a validation dataset. Additional analyses were performed in all 163 participants using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling.Approximately 20% (23/114) of the initial subset of the cohort suffered a second ACL injury. CART analysis identified age, sex, knee-related confidence, and performance on the triple hop for distance at the time of RTS as the primary predictors of a second ACL injury. Using these variables, a model was generated from which high-risk (n = 53) and low-risk groups (n = 61) were identified. A total of 22 participants in the high-risk group and 1 participant in the low-risk group suffered a second ACL injury. High-risk participants fit 1 of 2 profiles: (1) age <19 years, triple hop for distance between 1.34 and 1.90 times body height, and triple hop for distance limb symmetry index (LSI) <98.5% (n = 43) or (2) age <19 years, triple hop for distance >1.34 times body height, triple hop for distance LSI >98.5%, female sex, and high knee-related confidence (n = 10). The validation step identified the high-risk group as being 5 times (odds ratio, 5.14 [95% CI, 1.00-26.46]) more likely to suffer a second ACL injury, with a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 72.0%.These findings recognize measures that accurately identify young patients at high risk of sustaining a second ACL injury within 24 months after RTS. The development of a clinical decision algorithm to identify high-risk patients, inclusive of clinically feasible variables such as age, sex, confidence, and performance on the triple hop for distance, can serve as a foundation to re-evaluate appropriate discharge criteria for RTS.","This study evaluates clinical factors that predict the risk of a second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury following ACL reconstruction and return to sport. The authors developed a clinical decision algorithm based on participant assessments focusing on isokinetic strength, hop testing, and knee confidence, identifying key predictors such as age, sex, and performance metrics, which can aid in classifying athletes into high-risk and low-risk groups for sustaining a subsequent injury."

EFFECT OF “FIFA 11+” ON THE PATTERN OF FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENTS IN UNDER-14 SOCCER PLAYERS,2017-12-01,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte,"Gerald Baeza, Gustavo Paredes, Pablo Vega, Manuel Monrroy, Rubén Gajardo-Burgos","ABSTRACT Introduction: Increasing youth participation in soccer has several benefits, but it also brings risks of injury. The use of neuromuscular techniques is effective in preventing injuries, especially in periods of growth as occurs in puberty, which coincides with the development of fundamental basic movements. Therefore, it is important to implement and evaluate prevention programs that focus on neuromuscular control during this stage. Objective: To determine the effect of the FIFA 11+ over a six-week training period in order to quickly improve fundamental movement patterns in under-14 soccer players. Method: A quasi-experimental study that evaluated the fundamental movement patterns through the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) in 22 athletes who were divided into a control group (CG; N=11) and an experimental group (EG; N=11), submitted to the program FIFA 11+ for six weeks. The SPSS 20.0 program was used to analyze the data. Results: Statistically significant improvements were found in the in-line lunge (IL) and in the post-intervention FMS total scores in EG, as well as intergroup improvements when testing the deep squat (DS) in the EG, but not in both groups. Conclusions: The six week FIFA 11+ program did not produce significant improvements in players’ fundamental movements.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of the FIFA 11+ training program on improving fundamental movement patterns in under-14 soccer players over six weeks.

CLINICAL MEASURES OF HIP RANGE OF MOTION DO NOT CORRELATE WITH THE DEGREE OF CAM MORPHOLOGY IN SEMI-ELITE AUSTRALIAN FOOTBALLERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY,2017-12-01,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,"Myles Murphy, Joanne Kemp, Anne Smith, Jonathon Charlesworth, Kathy Briffa",Clinical testing to determine the presence of a cam morphology is becoming more common however the correlation between hip range of motion and the degree of cam morphology remains controversial in the literature. The prevalence of a cam morphology in athletes has been reported as higher than in the general population but the prevalence of cam morphology has not been reported in Australian Football (AF).The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between hip range of motion and hip alpha angle and report the proportion of players with a cam morphology in a sample of AF players.Cross-sectional Study.Twenty-one semi-elite AF players (42 hips) from the Peel Thunder Football Club were included in this study. A hip Flexion Internal Rotation (IR) test and a modified maximal squat test using the difference in depth of squat in hip internal and external rotation were used. These measures were then compared to alpha angles on 90 degree Dunn view x-rays.Four of the 42 hips (9.5%) had a cam morphology (alpha angle > 60 degrees). There was no significant correlation between alpha angle and ROM in a Flexion IR test or the difference in modified maximal squat test depth within this sample of players.The proportion of cam morphology seems to be lower in this sample than the previously reported prevalence in other sports. The lack of correlations between hip range and hip alpha angle in players means that screening hips using clinical measures to detect cam morphology associated with poor hip range of motion may be inaccurate.Level 3a.,"This study investigates the correlation between hip range of motion and cam morphology in semi-elite Australian footballers, aiming to determine the prevalence of cam morphology in this specific athletic population.

Skill not athleticism predicts individual variation in match performance of soccer players,2017-11-29,The Royal Society,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Robbie S. Wilson, Gwendolyn K. David, Sean C. Murphy, Michael J. Angilletta, Amanda C. Niehaus, Andrew H. Hunter, Michelle D. Smith","Just as evolutionary biologists endeavour to link phenotypes to fitness, sport scientists try to identify traits that determine athlete success. Both disciplines would benefit from collaboration, and to illustrate this, we used an analytical approach common to evolutionary biology to isolate the phenotypes that promote success in soccer, a complex activity of humans played in nearly every modern society. Using path analysis, we quantified the relationships among morphology, balance, skill, athleticism and performance of soccer players. We focused on performance in two complex motor activities: a simple game of soccer tennis (1 on 1), and a standard soccer match (11 on 11). In both contests, players with greater skill and balance were more likely to perform better. However, maximal athletic ability was not associated with success in a game. A social network analysis revealed that skill also predicted movement. The relationships between phenotypes and success during individual and team sports have potential implications for how selection acts on these phenotypes, in humans and other species, and thus should ultimately interest evolutionary biologists. Hence, we propose a field of evolutionary sports science that lies at the nexus of evolutionary biology and sports science. This would allow biologists to take advantage of the staggering quantity of data on performance in sporting events to answer evolutionary questions that are more difficult to answer for other species. In return, sports scientists could benefit from the theoretical framework developed to study natural selection in non-human species.","This paper investigates how skill and balance, rather than athleticism, influence individual match performance in soccer, utilizing analytical methods from evolutionary biology. By analyzing player performance in soccer tennis and standard matches, the study suggests a potential collaboration between evolutionary biologists and sports scientists to better understand phenotypic traits that contribute to success in sports."
Effects of wobble board training on single‐leg landing neuromechanics,2017-11-29,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"P. B. Silva, A. S. Oliveira, N. Mrachacz‐Kersting, U. G. Kersting","Balance training programs have been shown to reduce ankle sprain injuries in sports, but little is known about the transfer from this training modality to motor coordination and ankle joint biomechanics in sport-specific movements. This study aimed to investigate the effects of wobble board training on motor coordination and ankle mechanics during early single-leg landing from a lateral jump. Twenty-two healthy men were randomly assigned to either a control or a training group, who engaged in 4 weeks of wobble board training. Full-body kinematics, ground reaction force, and surface electromyography (EMG) from 12 lower limb muscles were recorded during landing. Ankle joint work in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane was calculated from 0 to 100 ms after landing. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was applied on the concatenated EMG Pre- and Post-intervention. Wobble board training increased the ankle joint eccentric work 1.2 times in the frontal (P < .01) and 4.4 times in the transverse plane (P < .01) for trained participants. Wobble board training modified the modular organization of muscle recruitment in the early landing phase by separating the activation of plantar flexors and mediolateral ankle stabilizers. Furthermore, the activation of secondary muscles across motor modules was reduced after training, refocusing the activation on the main muscles involved in the mechanical main subfunctions for each module. These results suggest that wobble board training may modify motor coordination when landing from a lateral jump, focusing on the recruitment of specific muscles/muscle groups that optimize ankle joint stability during early ground contact in single-leg landing.","The paper investigates the impact of wobble board training on motor coordination and ankle mechanics during single-leg landings following lateral jumps. Findings indicate that the training enhances ankle joint eccentric work and modifies muscle recruitment patterns, thereby improving ankle stability during early landing phases."

However, there is a lack of research on the biomechanical specificity of aquatic-based movement. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the kinetics and kinematics of loaded countermovement jumps performed in water versus land. Twenty young men and 24 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I female soccer and gymnastics athletes were asked to perform unloaded and loaded countermovement jumps on land and in chest-deep water immersion. A triaxial force platform and 2-dimensional videography produced various kinetic and kinematic measures of jump performance. Peak and mean mechanical power outputs (W) were 88% (8,919 ± 3,744 vs. 4,734 ± 1,418 W; p < 0.001) and 81% (3,640 ± 1,807 vs. 2,011 ± 736 W; p < 0.001) greater for jumps performed in water vs. land. Peak dorsiflexion velocity was 688% faster (44 ± 39 vs. 5.6 ± 5.4 degree·s; p < 0.001) for jumps performed in water and tended to model similarly with measures of mechanical power and amortization rate. Body weight normalized peak and mean mechanical power outputs decreased by 23.6 ± 2.7 and 23.8 ± 1.9% when load was added in the water. The addition of load on land was associated with an 8.7 ± 2.3 and 10.5 ± 4.4% decrease in body weight normalized peak and mean mechanical power. Results suggest that the aquatic environment alters movement primarily at amortization and may provide a unique training stimulus. Also, it can be concluded that fluid resistance and buoyancy combine to influence the mechanics of jumping movements performed in the water.","This paper investigates the biomechanical differences between loaded countermovement jumps performed on land and in water, focusing on kinetic and kinematic measurements in athletes.

Development of a test method for assessing laceration injury risk of individual cleats during game-relevant loading conditions,2017-11-27,Informa UK Limited,Footwear Science,"Bodil Oudshoorn, Heather Driscoll, Marcus Dunn, Terry Senior, David James","Professional rugby union players experience an injury once every 10 matches, and up to 23% of these injuries are skin lacerations. Current regulations to assess laceration injury risk of cleated footwear involve two optional mechanical tests for manufacturers: a drop test and a pendulum test. However, there is limited rationale for these tests and associated impact parameters. A questionnaire among 191 rugby players showed that the ruck is the most prevalent game scenario in which skin laceration injuries occur. During the ruck, laceration injuries result from stamping movements by players wearing cleated footwear. A biomechanical study was conducted to obtain game-relevant impact parameters of stamping in the ruck. Eight participants were asked to perform 10 stamps on an anthropomorphic test device. Kinetic and kinematic data were clustered – identifying two distinct phases of the stamp motion – providing test parameters for mechanical assessment of skin laceration risk. A two-phase mechanical test was designed to quantify laceration injury risk of individual cleats. Phase one represents initial impact and phase two represents the subsequent raking motion as observed in the biomechanical study. Each phase is based on the impact parameters of observed stamping impacts. The developed test method has the potential to be adapted as an international standard for assessing laceration injury risk of cleated footwear. Future research is required to assess the repeatability of this method and its sensitivity to laceration injury.","This paper discusses the development of a two-phase test method to assess the laceration injury risk of cleats used in rugby, addressing a significant prevalence of skin lacerations among players during gameplay. Key components include a biomechanical study that identifies specific impact parameters during stamping movements, providing a basis for establishing improved testing standards for cleated footwear."

Performance Differences Among Skilled Soccer Players of Different Playing Positions During Vertical Jumping and Landing,2017-11-25,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"John R.

Performance differences among skilled soccer players of different playing positions during vertical jumping and landing. J Strength Cond Res 32(2): 304–312, 2018—Both jumping and landing performance of skilled soccer players is diminished when task demands are increased. However, it is unclear if performance changes are specific to players of certain playing positions. Therefore, we assessed jumping and landing performance among skilled soccer players of different playing positions. Twenty-five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 male soccer players (179.5 ± 7.8 cm, 75.5 ± 7.1 kg, 19.7 ± 1.2 years) performed maximum effort vertical jump landings (VJLs), whereas vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) data were obtained. Participants were stratified into goalkeeping (GK), defensive (DEF), midfield (MID), and attacking (ATT) group according to their primary playing position. One-way analyses of variance (α = 0.05) and effect sizes (ESs; large ≥ 0.80) were used to compare differences among groups. The jumping phase variables evaluated were jump height, unloading and amortization vGRF magnitudes, eccentric rate of force development, and the reactive strength index. Landing phase variables included the peak vGRF magnitude, vGRF loading rate, vGRF attenuation rate, and landing time. No statistically significant differences were detected for any jumping or landing variable ( p ≥ 0.05). However, a number of large magnitude differences were detected during landing after ES calculations. Specifically, greater peak vGRF magnitudes were detected in DEF vs. both MID (ES = 1.08) and ATT (ES = 0.93), a greater vGRF loading rate occurred in DEF vs. MID (ES = 0.93), and a greater vGRF attenuation rate occurred in DEF vs. both MID (ES = 1.00) and AT (ES = 0.80). It is concluded that highly skilled soccer players possess position-specific abilities with respect to the landing phase of VJL. Skilled soccer players might experience enhanced training outcomes after VJL training regimens tailored to the specific demands of their primary playing position.","The paper investigates the performance differences in vertical jumping and landing among skilled soccer players across various playing positions (goalkeeping, defensive, midfield, and attacking). Although no statistically significant differences were found overall, large effect sizes indicated that defensive players exhibited greater peak vertical ground reaction force and loading rates compared to midfield and attacking players, suggesting that training regimens could be optimized based on specific position demands."
Novel mathematical model to estimate ball impact force in soccer,2017-11-22,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Takahito Iga, Hiroyuki Nunome, Shinya Sano, Nahoko Sato, Yasuo Ikegami","To assess ball impact force during soccer kicking is important to quantify from both performance and chronic injury prevention perspectives. We aimed to verify the appropriateness of previous models used to estimate ball impact force and to propose an improved model to better capture the time history of ball impact force. A soccer ball was fired directly onto a force platform (10 kHz) at five realistic kicking ball velocities and ball behaviour was captured by a high-speed camera (5,000 Hz). The time history of ball impact force was estimated using three existing models and two new models. A new mathematical model that took into account a rapid change in ball surface area and heterogeneous ball deformation showed a distinctive advantage to estimate the peak forces and its occurrence times and to reproduce time history of ball impact forces more precisely, thereby reinforcing the possible mechanics of 'footballer's ankle'. Ball impact time was also systematically shortened when ball velocity increases in contrast to practical understanding for producing faster ball velocity, however, the aspect of ball contact time must be considered carefully from practical point of view.","This paper presents a novel mathematical model for estimating ball impact force during soccer kicking, highlighting the importance of accurate force assessment for performance and injury prevention. The study demonstrates that the new model, which accounts for rapid changes in ball surface area and deformation, significantly improves the estimation of peak forces and their timing compared to existing models, while also revealing insights into the mechanics of ball contact time as kicking velocity increases."

Thirty-six male collegiate team-sport (23 Rugby/13 Soccer) athletes (age: 20 ± 1.4 years; height: 1.80 ± 0.08 m; mass: 83 ± 13.2 kg) participated in the study. Each athlete performed 3 trials of a 20-m sprint (with 5 and 10 m splits) and 2 change of direction (COD) tests (90° cut and 505 tests) cutting/turning from both legs. Completion times for all sprint and COD tests were measured using timing cells. For both COD tests, CODD was determined (COD completion time-10 m sprint time). Pearson correlation was used to explore the relationships between sprint times and CODD and completion times. Significant (p < 0.001) moderate-to-large (r ≥ 0.467) correlations between sprint times and 90° cut completion times for left and right cuts were observed. Nonsignificant (p > 0.05) trivial-to-small correlations (r ≤ 0.199) were found between sprint variables and 90° cut CODD. Significant (p < 0.001) large to very large correlations (r ≥ 0.531) were revealed between the left and right 90° cut and 90° cut CODD. The results suggest that the CODD could be applied to isolate and assess the cutting ability in COD speed tests that involve a single cutting maneuver. Failure to inspect CODD could lead to incorrect evaluation of an athletes cutting or COD ability.","The paper investigates the application of the change of direction deficit (CODD) in evaluating cutting ability during a 90° cut test in collegiate team-sport athletes.

To prospectively examine adolescent athletes' gait and quiet-stance performance while concurrently completing a cognitive task acutely after concussion and after symptom resolution. Case-control study. Sport concussion clinic. Thirty-seven athletes (age = 16.2 ± 3.1 years; 54% female) were diagnosed with a concussion, and their performance was compared with that of a group of 44 uninjured control participants (age = 15.0 ± 2.0 years; 57% female). Participants diagnosed with a concussion completed a symptom inventory and single- and dual-task gait and quiet-stance evaluations within 21 days of injury and then again after symptom resolution. Gait and postural-control measurements were quantified using an inertial sensor system and analyzed using multivariate analyses of covariance. Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, single-task and dual-task gait measures, quiet-stance measures, and cognitive task performance. At the initial postinjury examination, single-task gait stride length (1.16 ± 0.14 versus 1.25 ± 0.13 m, P = .003) and dual-task gait stride length (1.02 ± 0.13 m versus 1.10 ± 0.13 m, P = .011) for the concussion group compared with the control group, respectively, were shorter. After symptom resolution, no single-task gait differences were found, but the concussion group demonstrated slower gait velocity (0.78 ± 0.15 m/s versus 0.92 ± 0.14 m/s, P = .005), lower cadence (92.5 ± 12.2 steps/min versus 99.3 ± 7.8 steps/min, P < .001), and a shorter stride length (0.99 ± 0.15 m versus 1.10 ± 0.13 m, P = .003) during dual-task gait than the control group. No between-groups differences were detected during quiet stance at either time point. Acutely after concussion, single-task and dual-task stride-length alterations were present among youth athletes compared with a control group. Although single-task gait alterations were not detected after symptom resolution, dual-task gait differences persisted, suggesting that dual-task gait alterations may persist longer after concussion than single-task gait or objective quiet-stance alterations. Dual-task gait assessments may, therefore, be a useful component in monitoring concussion recovery after symptom resolution.","This paper examines the impact of concussion on adolescent athletes' gait and quiet-stance performance during cognitive tasks both acutely after injury and after symptom resolution.

Poor performers repeated the task standing on prefabricated foot orthoses.Peak external knee adduction moment (KAM) and peak angles for the trunk, hip, knee, and ankle.Compared with good performers, poor performers had a significantly lower peak KAM (mean difference = 0.11 Nm/kg, 95% confidence interval = 0.02 to 0.2 Nm/kg), higher peak hip adduction angle (-4.3°, -7.6° to -0.9°), and higher peak trunk axial rotation toward their stance limb (3.8°, 0.4° to 7.2°). Foot orthoses significantly increased the peak KAM in poor performers (-0.06 Nm/kg, -0.1 to -0.01 Nm/kg), with values approximating those observed in good performers.Findings validate Crossley et al's visual rating criteria for single-leg squat performance in asymptomatic athletes, and suggest that ""off-the-shelf"" foot orthoses may be a simple intervention for poor performers to normalize the magnitude of the external KAM during single-leg squat.","The paper investigates the biomechanical differences in single-leg squat performance between athletes rated as poor and good performers, validating visual rating criteria for assessing squat technique.

The current study sought to determine whether change in body mass index (ΔBMI) after retirement influences the prevalence of CHD, diabetes, or high blood pressure (HBP) in former professional football players.Retired professional football players (n = 3729) were sent a survey with questions regarding health status, playing history, and demographic information. Self-reported BMI at the time of retirement was subtracted from current self-reported BMI to calculate ΔBMI. Prevalence of CHD, diabetes, and HBP were determined by asking participants if they had ever been diagnosed by a health care professional. Binomial regression with a Poisson residual and robust variance estimation was used to compute crude prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome. Adjusted PR values were calculated by adjusting for BMI at the time of retirement, age, years of football experience, race, exercise habits, alcohol use, steroid history, smoking history, and playing position.Complete data were available for 2062 respondents.

Postretirement interventions using diet and/or exercise to influence body composition may improve long-term health in retired football players.","This paper investigates the relationship between changes in body mass index (ΔBMI) after retirement and the prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases in retired professional football players. Findings indicate that an increase in ΔBMI is significantly associated with higher rates of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, suggesting that targeted interventions on body composition may benefit the long-term health of retired athletes."
Examining the Presence of Back Pain in Competitive Athletes: A Focus on Stress and Recovery,2017-11-15,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Jahan Heidari, Johanna Belz, Monika Hasenbring, Jens Kleinert, Claudia Levenig, Michael Kellmann","Explanatory approaches for back pain (BP) in athletes focus on biomechanical factors while neglecting psychological perspectives. Psychological factors have gained importance in the prediction of injuries in athletes and BP in the general population, with stress and recovery emerging as central risk factors. However, scarce evidence exists regarding the role of these aspects for the prevalent burden of BP.To investigate the association between stress and recovery parameters and the presence of BP.Cross-sectional design.The questionnaires were distributed after the training sessions.A total of 345 competitive athletes (mean age = 18.31 y [SD = 5.40]) were investigated. The classification of the athletes' competitive status was based on performance level.Data were collected using questionnaires for the assessment of stress, recovery, and BP.The authors performed a multiple logistic regression to obtain odds ratios for stress and recovery parameters with regard to the outcome variable BP status.For stress, the dimension ""overall stress"" (odds ratio = 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.59; P = .001) and the scale ""physical complaints"" (odds ratio = 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.25; P = .001) of the general version of the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire resulted to be significantly associated with BP. None of the recovery-related scales displayed a statistically significant relationship with BP.The outcomes of this study imply a modest association between stress and the presence of BP in competitive athletes. Practitioners may take these findings into account regarding the conception of training and for monitoring purposes.","The paper investigates the association between stress and recovery parameters and back pain (BP) in competitive athletes. It highlights that greater overall stress and specific physical complaints are significantly associated with the presence of BP, suggesting that psychological factors should be considered alongside traditional biomechanical approaches in training and monitoring practices for athletes."
Correlation of Concussion Symptom Profile with Head Impact Biomechanics: A Case for Individual-Specific Injury Tolerance,2017-11-14,Mary Ann Liebert Inc,Journal of Neurotrauma,"Steven Rowson, Stefan M.

DiFiori, Alison Brooks, Kevin Guskiewicz, Darren Campbell, Gerald McGinty, Steven J. Svoboda, Kenneth L. Cameron, Steven P. Broglio, Thomas W. McAllister, Michael McCrea","Concussion is a brain injury induced by biomechanical forces that is broadly defined as a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain. The intricate link between biomechanical input and concussion injury response is poorly understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that greater biomechanical forces would result in the presentation of more concussion-related symptoms that would take longer to resolve. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between an array of biomechanical parameters measured for concussive impacts and the presentation and resolution of concussion symptoms. A total of 319 collegiate football players from six universities were recruited to participate in this study. Certified athletic trainers and/or team physicians at each site diagnosed and treated concussions sustained by subjects through participation in football. The subjects' helmets were instrumented with accelerometer arrays that measured linear and rotational head accelerations for each impact experienced during games and practices. Correlations between biomechanical measurements associated with concussion symptom presentation and recovery were quantified. A total of 22 subjects collectively sustained 25 concussions, with three subjects sustaining two concussions each. Biomechanical measures associated with injury were not found to be correlated with number of symptoms, Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 Symptom Severity Score, or time to symptom resolution. Linear and rotational accelerations associated with injury were not correlated with symptom severity for any of the 22 individual symptoms evaluated. Further, we found no association between impact location and presence of any individual symptom when ignoring severity grade. While concussive impacts did not stand out relative to impacts that did not result in injury, concussive impacts were among the most severe for each individual player. This suggests tolerance to head acceleration might be individual-specific, meaning similar biomechanical inputs can produce different injury presentations between individuals. Future investigations should consider individual-specific analyses of tolerance to head acceleration and injury response.","This paper investigates the relationship between biomechanical parameters of head impacts and concussion symptom presentation and recovery in collegiate football players. The study found no significant correlations between biomechanical measures and the severity or resolution of symptoms, suggesting that individual-specific tolerance to head acceleration may influence concussion outcomes."
Effects of Drop-height and Surface Instability on Jump Performance and Knee Kinematics,2017-11-09,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Melanie Lesinski, Olaf Prieske, Rainer Beurskens, David Behm, Urs Granacher","Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the combined effects of drop-height and surface condition on drop jump (DJ) performance and knee joint kinematics. DJ performance, sagittal and frontal plane knee joint kinematics were measured in jump experienced young male and female adults during DJs on stable, unstable and highly unstable surfaces using different drop-heights (20, 40, 60 cm). Findings revealed impaired DJ performance (Δ5–16%; p&lt;0.05; 1.43≤d≤2.82), reduced knee valgus motion (Δ33–52%; p&lt;0.001; 2.70≤d≤3.59), and larger maximum knee flexion angles (Δ13–19%; p&lt;0.01; 1.74≤d≤1.75) when using higher (60 cm) compared to lower drop-heights (≤40 cm). Further, lower knee flexion angles and velocity were found (Δ8-16%; p&lt;0.01; 1.49≤d≤2.38) with increasing surface instability. When performing DJs from high (60 cm) compared to moderate drop-heights (40 cm) on highly unstable surfaces, higher knee flexion velocity and maximum knee valgus angles were found (Δ15–19%; p&lt;0.01; 1.50≤d≤1.53). No significant main and/or interaction effects were observed for the factor sex. In conclusion, knee motion strategies were modified by the factors ‘drop-height’ and/or ‘surface instability’. The combination of high drop-heights (&gt;40 cm) together with highly unstable surfaces should be used cautiously during plyometrics because this may increase the risk of injury due to higher knee valgus stress.","This paper investigates the effects of drop-height and surface instability on drop jump performance and knee joint kinematics in young adults. The findings indicate that higher drop-heights impair performance and modify knee motion strategies, highlighting potential injury risks associated with high drop-heights on unstable surfaces."
Balance Performance as Observed by Center-of-Pressure Parameter Characteristics in Male Soccer Athletes and Non-Athletes,2017-11-08,MDPI AG,Sports,"Lara Thompson, Mehdi Badache, Steven Cale, Lonika Behera, Nian Zhang","Static balance has a relevant influence on athletic performance as well as on reducing the risk of injury. The main goal of this study was to assess soccer athlete versus non-athlete balance performance via displacement and velocity parameters extracted from the center-of-pressure (COP) position time series. In order to accomplish our goal, we investigated standing balance in two male groups with unimpaired balance: non-athletes (n = 12) and collegiate varsity soccer athletes (n = 12). In order to make the standing balancing task more or less difficult, we altered participant base-of-support, as well as vision, yielding static (quiet stance) test conditions increasing in difficulty. From the COP position time series, displacement and velocity parameters were computed and plotted as a function of increasing test condition difficulty level. COP parameters showed steeper increases with increased test difficulty in non-athletes compared to athletes; this demonstrated athletes' better ability to control their balance. We concluded that balance performance could be characterized via COP displacement and velocity response curves. This study lends new insights into how COP parameters can be utilized to determine and characterize improvements in balance between un-impaired subject populations (athletes versus non-athletes).","This study investigates the balance performance of male collegiate soccer athletes compared to non-athletes by analyzing center-of-pressure (COP) parameters during varying difficulty levels of standing balance tasks. The results indicate that athletes exhibit superior balance control as evidenced by less dramatic increases in COP displacement and velocity with increasing task difficulty, highlighting the significance of balance in athletic performance and injury prevention."
Meniscectomy and Resultant Articular Cartilage Lesions of the Knee Among Prospective National Football League Players: An Imaging and Performance Analysis,2017-11-07,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Jorge Chahla, Mark E. Cinque, Jonathan A. Godin, George Sanchez, George F. Lebus, James M. Whalen, Mark D. Price, Nicholas I. Kennedy, Gilbert Moatshe, Robert F. LaPrade, Matthew T. Provencher","Background: The effect of prior meniscectomy and the resulting reduction in meniscal tissue on a potential National Football League (NFL) player’s articular cartilage status and performance remain poorly elucidated. Purpose/Hypothesis: (1) To determine the epidemiology, imaging characteristics, and associated articular cartilage pathology of the knee among players with a previous meniscectomy who were participating in the NFL Combine and (2) to evaluate the effect of these injuries on performance as compared with matched controls. The hypothesis was that players with less meniscal tissue would have worse cartilage status and inferior performance metrics in their first 2 NFL seasons. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All athletes with a history of a meniscectomy and magnetic resonance imaging scan of the knee who participated in the NFL Combine (2009-2015) were identified. Medical records and imaging were analyzed, and surgical history, games missed in college, position played, and draft position were documented. The conditions of the meniscus and cartilage were graded with modified ISAKOS scores (International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine) and ICRS scores (International Cartilage Repair Society), respectively. Players with a previous meniscectomy of at least 10% of total medial or lateral meniscal volume excised (ISAKOS meniscus grade ≤8) and matched controls without a significant pre-Combine injury were similarly evaluated and compared by position of play through analysis of draft position, number of games played and started, and how many eligible plays they participated in (snap percentage) within the first 2 NFL seasons. Results: Of the 2285 players who participated in the NFL Combine (2009-2015), 287 players (322 knees) had a prior meniscectomy (206 lateral, 81 medial). Among these players, 247 (85%) had a total of 249 chondral lesions, most commonly on the lateral femoral condyle (111 lesions, 45%). There was a significant inverse correlation found between the ISAKOS medial and lateral meniscus grade and the corresponding compartment chondral lesion grade ( P = .001). A poorer meniscus score was also associated with worse chondral pathology, especially in the lateral compartment. After controlling for position of play, the injury-free control group had a significantly greater number of total games played and games started and higher snap percentage versus those with a prior meniscectomy of at least 10% volume (ISAKOS meniscus grade ≤8). Players with severe chondral lesions (ICRS grade 4) in the medial and lateral compartments had significantly worse performance metrics when compared with matched controls. Conclusion: Previous meniscectomy of at least 10% of total medial or lateral meniscus volume in prospective NFL players was significantly correlated with larger and more severe chondral lesions. Chondral and meniscal defects of the knee were found to result in a significant decrease in objective performance measures during a player’s initial NFL career versus matched controls. Given these findings, players with a prior meniscectomy with evidence of chondral damage should be evaluated carefully for their overall functional levels; however, additional work is needed to fully clarify the effect of prior knee meniscal surgery on overall NFL performance.","This paper investigates the impact of previous meniscectomy on the articular cartilage status and performance of National Football League (NFL) players. It finds that players who underwent a meniscectomy have more severe chondral lesions and significantly worse performance metrics in their first two NFL seasons compared to matched controls, emphasizing the need for careful evaluation of these players."
Low perceptual sensitivity to altered video speed in viewing a soccer match,2017-11-07,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Claudio de’Sperati, Gabriel Baud Bovy","Abstract When watching videos, our sense of reality is continuously challenged. How much can a fundamental dimension of experience such as visual flow be modified before breaking the perception of real time? Here we found a remarkable indifference to speed manipulations applied to a popular video content, a soccer match. In a condition that mimicked real-life TV watching, none of 100 naïve observers spontaneously noticed speed alterations up/down to 12%, even when asked to report motion anomalies, and showed very low sensitivity to video speed changes (Just Noticeable Difference, JND = 18%). When tested with a constant-stimuli speed discrimination task, JND was still high, though much reduced (9%). The presence of the original voice-over with compensation for pitch did not affect perceptual performance. Thus, our results document a rather broad tolerance to speed manipulations in video viewing, even under attentive scrutiny. This finding may have important implications. For example, it can validate video compression strategies based on sub-threshold temporal squeezing. This way, a soccer match can last only 80 min and still be perceived as natural. More generally, knowing the boundaries of natural speed perception may help to optimize the flow of artificial visual stimuli which increasingly surround us.","The paper investigates the perception of video speed changes while viewers watch a soccer match and reveals that individuals exhibit a low sensitivity to alterations in speed, not noticing changes of up to 12%. The findings suggest that there is a broad tolerance for speed manipulations in video viewing, which could have implications for video compression techniques in sports broadcasting."
Are Lower Extremity Injuries Related to Spinal form Abnormalities in Professional Football Players? A Prospective Cohort Study,2017-11-05,Brieflands,Asian Journal of Sports Medicine,"Sara Lotfian, Navid Moghadam, Bahar Hassnamirzaie, Salman Khalifeh Soltani","Background: A professional football player sustains 2 injuries per season on average. Lower extremity injuries are the most common injuries among football players. To develop a prevention programs it is essential to recognize risk factors associated with the incidence of injuries. Previous studies focused on intrinsic risk factors of lower extremity. The association between spine abnormities and lower extremity injuries in professional athletes have only been scarcely studied. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of various spinal form abnormalities on the rate of lower extremity injuries in male professional football players. Methods: This cohort study among Iranian Football players was implemented during the 2015 - 2016 season. All players were assessed for spinal alignment during Pre Participation Examinations. In total, club doctors documented information of 244 players out of 420 players. Results: There were 155 injuries recorded in total with at least one day absence from training or match, of which the most common injuries were hamstring muscle injuries (n = 41, 26%), ankle ligament injuries (n = 34, 22%) and adductor injuries (n = 25, 16%) respectively. Increasing thoracic kyphosis Cobb's angle was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of exhibiting quadriceps injury, odds ratio (CI 95%): 0.806 (0.671 - 0.968). Conclusions: The reason why players with lower thoracic kyphosis Cobb's angle may be at risk for quadriceps injury is not clear. But biomechanical changes such as extensibility of hamstring and the balance between hamstring and quadriceps may partially explain the increased risk.","This study investigates the relationship between spinal form abnormalities and the incidence of lower extremity injuries among professional football players. The findings indicate a significant association between the thoracic kyphosis Cobb's angle and the likelihood of quadriceps injuries, suggesting that biomechanical factors may influence the risk of specific lower limb injuries."

Current knee pain was defined as pain in or around the knees on most days of the previous month. Presence and severity of RKOA were assessed on standardised radiographs using the Nottingham Line Drawing Atlas (NLDA) in a subsample of 470 ex-footballers and 491 men in the comparison group. The adjusted risk ratio (aRR) and adjusted risk difference (aRD) with 95% CI in ex-footballers compared with the general population were calculated using the marginal model in Stata.Ex-footballers were more likely than the comparison group to have current knee pain (aRR 1.91, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.06), RKOA (aRR 2.21, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.54) and TKR (aRR 3.61, 95% CI 2.90 to 4.50). Ex-footballers were also more likely to present with chondrocalcinosis (aRR 3.41, 95% CI 2.44 to 4.77). Prevalence of knee pain and RKOA were higher in ex-footballers at all ages. However, even after adjustment for significant knee injury and other risk factors, there was more than a doubling of risk of these outcomes in footballers.The prevalence of all knee osteoarthritis outcomes (knee pain, RKOA and TKR) were two to three times higher in male ex-footballers compared with men in the general population group. Knee injury is the main attributable risk factor. Even after adjustment for recognised risk factors, knee osteoarthritis appear to be an occupational hazard of professional football.","This paper investigates the prevalence of knee pain, radiographic knee osteoarthritis (RKOA), and total knee replacement (TKR) among retired male professional footballers compared to men in the general population.

Muscle injury rate in professional football is higher in matches played within 5 days since the previous match: a 14-year prospective study with more than 130 000 match observations,2017-11-03,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Håkan Bengtsson, Jan Ekstrand, Markus Waldén, Martin Hägglund","Background The association between match congestion and injury rates in professional football has yielded conflicting results. Aim To analyse associations between match congestion on an individual player level and injury rates during professional football matches. Methods Data from a prospective cohort study of professional football with 133 170 match observations were analysed with Poisson regressions. Associations between short-term match congestion, defined as number of days between two match exposures (≤3, 4, 5, 6 and 7–10 days) and injury rates were analysed. To analyse the influence of long-term match congestion, defined as individual match exposure hours in the 30 days preceding a match, observations were categorised into three groups (low, ≤4.5; medium, &gt;4.5 to ≤7.5; and high, &gt;7.5 hours). Results No differences in total match injury rates were found between the reference category (≤3 days) and the other categories of short-term congestion. Muscle injury rates were significantly lower in matches preceded by 6 (rate ratio (RR) 0.79; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.95) or 7–10 days (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93) compared with ≤3 days since the last match exposure. No differences in total and muscle injury rates between the three long-term match congestion groups were found.

To investigate the amount of roll-angle variability at the foot during a fatiguing exercise protocol in participants with CAI. Controlled laboratory study. Motion-analysis research laboratory. A total of 18 volunteers with CAI (10 men, 8 women; age = 29.8 ± 9.2 years, height = 175.8 ± 11.2 cm, mass = 75.4 ± 10.7 kg) and 17 volunteers serving as controls (8 men, 9 women; age = 28.2 ± 6.3 years, height = 172.3 ± 10.6 cm, mass = 68.8 ± 12.9 kg). Kinematic data for foot position were collected while participants performed a functional fatigue protocol based on shuttle runs. Variability (ie, standard deviation) of the roll angle of the foot about the x-axis, corresponding to inversion-eversion, was measured at 2 discrete times: 50 milliseconds before foot strike and 65% of stance. No differences in roll-angle range or variability were observed between limbs in either group. At 65% of stance, we found a main effect for time, whereby both groups demonstrated decreased roll-angle ranges at the end of the fatigue protocol ( P = .01). A between-groups effect in the roll-angle variability at 65% of stance was noted ( P = .04), with the CAI group exhibiting higher levels of variability. No between-groups differences were observed at 50 milliseconds before foot strike. Chronic ankle instability is a complex, multifactorial condition that can affect patients in diverse ways. Identifying excessive foot-position variability in particular situations could potentially inform targeted rehabilitation programs.","This paper investigates the variability in foot orientation during running in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and how this variability changes with fatigue. The study found that while there were no differences in roll-angle range between groups, those with CAI exhibited greater roll-angle variability during the later stages of a fatiguing running protocol, suggesting that this could impact their risk of recurrent ankle sprains and guide rehabilitation efforts."

This study compared the mean and the peak pressures over the whole foot and ten separate areas of the foot, wearing different shoes during specific movements. Methods Nine male adult recreational futsal players performed three trials of three sport-specific movements (shuffle, sprint and penalty kick), while they were wearing three brands of futsal shoes (Adidas, Lotto and Tiger). Plantar pressures on dominant feet were collected using the F-SCAN system. Peak and mean pressures for whole foot and each separate area were extracted. For statistical analysis, the mean differences in outcome variables between different shoes and movements were estimated using random-effects regression model using STATA ver.10. Results In the average calculation of the three movements, the peak pressure on the whole foot in Adidas shoe was less than Lotto [8.8% (CI95%: 4.1–13.6%)] and Tiger shoes [11.8% (CI95%:7–16.7%)], (P<0.001). Also, the recorded peak pressure on the whole foot in penalty kick was 61.1% (CI95%: 56.3–65.9%) and 57.6% (CI95%: 52.8–62.3%) less than Shuffle and Sprint tests, respectively (P<0.001).

Biomechanical and motor performance differences between female and male soccer players,2017-10-31,Routledge,Football Biomechanics,"Katharina Althoff, Ewald M. Hennig","There are many anatomical and physiological, psychological, and constitutional differences between adult women and men: on average women are 10 to 15 cm shorter and 10 to 20 kg lighter than men. The biological differences directly affect match performance of female and male soccer players in general and soccer specific movements and ball handling skills. Biological differences lead to different playing behaviours of female and male soccer players. Moreover, the level of professionalization is lower in women soccer. The match analysis showed differences between female and male players regarding their kicking techniques used in a soccer match. Several studies were performed to analyse kicking accuracy as well as kicking techniques and velocity while kicking as accurately as possible under controlled conditions. The different use of kicking techniques characterizes gender specific playing behaviour.

Influence of traction on running performance and lower extremity loading of soccer players,2017-10-31,Routledge,Football Biomechanics,Thorsten Sterzing,"This chapter addresses knowledge of traction effects on players' acceleration, cutting, and turning performance under consideration of their lower extremity loading. It also addresses current knowledge of performance and injury prevention related to soccer traction. In soccer optimal traction of players is essential for game success as it translates directly into athletic performance. Competitive soccer has numerous performance demands, among them running performance is regarded a key aspect. Surface conditions and shoe outsole configurations alter the specific functionality of shoe-to-surface interaction, thereby influencing running performance. Shoe-to-surface interaction during soccer actions influences in particular lower extremity loading of players, also triggering specific alteration of lower leg kinematics. During traction analyses of shoe and surface combinations, there needs to be a distinction between mechanical availability and biomechanical utilization of traction. In both evaluation scenarios measured values are sensitive to alteration of shoe–surface combinations.","This paper examines the impact of traction on soccer players' performance, specifically focusing on acceleration, cutting, and turning under varying surface conditions and shoe outsole configurations. It highlights the importance of optimal traction for enhancing running performance and reducing injury risk, as well as differentiating between mechanical availability and biomechanical utilization during traction analyses."
Does biomechanical evidence support coaching cues of kicking?,2017-10-31,Routledge,Football Biomechanics,Hiroyuki Nunome,"This chapter provides an overview of findings of soccer kicking biomechanics and sheds some light on the veracity of some practical coaching instructions from a biomechanical perspective. Kicking is the kicking technique that has been most widely studied from a biomechanical perspective. Leg swing kinematics at or just before ball contact during kicking are important for determining the resultant ball velocity, because there is a robust relationship that exists between the final foot velocity and the resultant ball velocity. Ball impact transient has been treated as something of a and thus to explore the inside of the black box is a challenge for researchers. There is one study which treated ball impact dynamics using a very fast sampling frequency. Among many forms of soccer kicking, the side-foot kick is the most frequently used technique when a short and precise pass or shot is required.","This paper examines the biomechanics of soccer kicking, evaluating the effectiveness of coaching cues related to kicking techniques. It highlights the importance of leg swing kinematics at ball contact for achieving high ball velocity, and emphasizes the side-foot kick as the most commonly employed technique for precise passes and shots."
Biomechanical characteristics of the long throw-in,2017-10-31,Routledge,Football Biomechanics,Hironari Shinkai,"The soccer throw-in is a method of restarting play from the touchline using a player's hands. There are some detailed rules for delivering the ball in this restart. Training for long throw-ins seems to have little focus in spite of its usefulness, because coaching cues derived from biomechanical research is lacking. Rory Delap, an Irish professional footballer who played in the English Premier League, is one of the world's most famous long throwers in soccer, and was often referred as the Human Sling. However, as female and teen footballers can perform the long throw-in, muscular strength may be important but not a necessity; technical factors may be more important for a long distance throw-in. A three-dimensional biomechanical understanding of the motions required for the long throw-in is necessary to further the knowledge. To address the deficiency of a three-dimensional analysis of the upper body motion of a group of throwers including one outstanding long thrower was conducted.","This paper investigates the biomechanical characteristics of the long throw-in in soccer, emphasizing the need for a three-dimensional analysis of upper body motions involved in the technique. It highlights the importance of technical factors over muscular strength in executing effective long throw-ins, addressing a gap in coaching and training methods for this skill."

Analysis of Factors Related to Back Squat Concentric Velocity,2017-10-27,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Christopher A. Fahs, Lindy M. Rossow, Michael C. Zourdos","Fahs, CA, Rossow, LM, and Zourdos, MC. Aanalysis of factors related to back squat concentric velocity. J Strength Cond Res 32(9): 2435-2441, 2018-Measuring bar velocity during barbell exercises can be a useful metric for prescribing resistance training loads and for predicting the 1 repetition maximum (1RM). However, it is not clear whether either anthropometric factors (e.g., limb length) or training experience influences bar velocity. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between 1RM back squat bar velocity and femur length, training experience, strength, and 36.6-m sprint time in college athletes. Thirteen college football (22 ± 1 years) and 8 college softball players (20 ± 1 years) performed the 36.6-m sprint followed by a 1RM back squat protocol while average concentric velocity and peak concentric velocity were measured. Height (m), body mass (kg), squat training experience (years), squat frequency (d·wk), and femur length (m) were also measured. Pearson product moment correlations were used to determine the relationship between variables. Average concentric velocity was not related to training age (r = 0.150, p = 0.515), squat frequency (r = 0.254, p = 0.266), femur length (r = 0.002, p = 0.992), or relative strength (r = -0.090, p = 0.699). Peak concentric velocity was related to 36.6-m sprint time (r = -0.612, p = 0.003), relative squat average (r = 0.489, p = 0.029), and relative peak (r = 0.901, p < 0.001) power. These results suggest that college athletes using velocity to regulate squat training may not necessarily need to modify velocity ranges based on limb length or training age. In addition, peak velocity during a 1RM back squat may be a useful indicator of an athlete's relative power output ability and speed. Coaches may consider measuring velocity during strength testing as a surrogate measure for speed and power.","This paper investigates the relationship between back squat concentric velocity and various factors such as femur length, training experience, and sprint performance in college athletes. The findings indicate that while peak concentric velocity is significantly associated with 36.6-meter sprint time and relative power, average concentric velocity is not influenced by limb length or training age, suggesting that velocity may be used effectively to assess strength without adjustment for these factors."
Sex and age differences in head acceleration during purposeful soccer heading,2017-10-25,Informa UK Limited,Research in Sports Medicine,"Jaclyn B. Caccese, Thomas A. Buckley, Ryan T. Tierney, William C. Rose, Joseph J. Glutting, Thomas W. Kaminski","Differences in head–neck segment mass, purposeful heading technique, and cervical strength and stiffness may contribute to differences in head accelerations across sex and age. The purpose of this study was to compare head acceleration across sex and age (youth [12–14 years old], high school and collegiate) during purposeful soccer heading. One-hundred soccer players (42 male, 58 female, 17.1 ± 3.5 years, 168.5 ± 20.3 cm, 61.5 ± 13.7 kg) completed 12 controlled soccer headers at an initial ball velocity of 11.2 m/s. Linear and rotational accelerations were measured using a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope and were transformed to the head centre-of-mass. A MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate main effect for sex (Pillai's Trace = .165, F(2,91) = 11.868, p < .001), but not for age (Pillai's Trace = .033, F(4,182) = 0.646, p = .630). Peak linear and rotational accelerations were higher in females (40.9 ± 13.3 g; 3279 ± 1065 rad/s2) than males (27.6 ± 8.5 g, 2219 ± 823 rad/s2).

Should heading be forbidden in children’s football?,2017-10-23,Informa UK Limited,Science and Medicine in Football,Alexander A. Tarnutzer,"Background: Football (soccer) is the most popular sports in children and adolescents worldwide. While it has been embraced as a low-risk-for-injury sport, discussions about potential long-term effects have emerged. As part of a legal settlement, the US Soccer Federation has issued a ban for heading in children aged 10 years and younger in 2015.Purpose: What is the scientific evidence for this decision and should other countries adapt it?Main findings: When reviewing the literature, it becomes evident that data on acute/persistent effects of heading and head-related injuries is inconclusive and hampered by limitations. These include recall biases, flaws in statistical analyses and inappropriate assessments of heading-frequency and head-injuries – mainly performed retrospectively via questionnaires. Epidemiologic data indicates that the majority of head-injuries is due to contact with other players (35–75%) followed by surfaces/objects (13–32%) and ball-contact (20–30%).Conclusions: Overall, current evidence seems insufficient to support a ban of heading in children’s football. Until more solid data is available, heading should not be started before children confirm to be ready to do so. Then, heading should be introduced stepwise and controlled using structured heading training focusing on technical aspects. Whether this should be at age 11 years or earlier needs to be determined.","The paper investigates the implications of banning heading in children's football, particularly in light of a US Soccer Federation decision for players aged 10 and under. It highlights the inconclusive nature of existing data on head-related injuries and suggests that, until more definitive evidence emerges, heading should be introduced gradually and with technical training, rather than being outright banned."
Hamstring muscle injuries in elite football: translating research into practice,2017-10-19,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Matthew Buckthorpe, Mo Gimpel, Steve Wright, Thomas Sturdy, Matthew Stride","Hamstring muscle injuries (HMI) are consistently the most prevalent time-loss injury in football and are prone to reoccurrence.1 We note the disconnection between evidence-based recommendations and the HMI prevention programmes adopted in elite clubs.2 For example, only 11% of elite level football teams surveyed fully use the Nordic Hamstring Programme.3 

Why don’t elite sports medicine teams adopt evidence-based practices?4 The aim of this editorial is not only to share our experience of HMI prevention and demonstrate that elite clubs do consider the research on HMI, but also place this alongside other factors which, although may not yet be ‘evidenced based’, have theoretical merit and clinically observed benefits in the prevention of HMIs within elite football. We feel there is an overemphasis placed on isolated strength capacity in HMI management within the recommended research, with a lack of focus on contextual factors. Furthermore, there is typically limited consideration of how the muscle functions during the mechanisms in which it is typically used and injured.

Recent findings revealed that high peak loads on the knee and thigh during impact of a sliding tackle are critical for inducing skin injuries. Unfortunately, skin failure data under combined impact load is lacking.Methods: In this study the load tolerance of skin to impact on both dry and wet artificial turf and natural grass is investigated by developing an ex-vivo model, a biaxial load applicator and a loading protocol.Results: The critical shear-normal stress combination at which skin breakdown occurred on dry artificial turf was 38 and 20 N.cm−2. Skin damage on wet artificial turf firstly was noticed at a shear-normal stress combination of 55 and 20 N.cm−2. On natural grass, skin breakdown only occurred at a combined shear and normal stress of 130 and 125 N.cm−2. The thickness of the stratum corneum after impact strongly correlated to the applied mechanical load during impact on dry artificial turf.Conclusion: In contrast to natural grass, skin damage on dry artificial turf is strongly related to the magnitude of the impact load. Wetting of the artificial turf system improves the load tolerance of skin to impact.","This paper investigates the load tolerance of skin during impacts with artificial turf and natural grass using an ex-vivo model to develop a comprehensive understanding of skin injuries caused by sliding tackles.

We aim to extend previous analyses and examine sex-differences in the incidence of head injuries, odds of head injuries within an injured sample, and severity of head injuries, among collegiate soccer players between 2004 and 2009.Data collected within the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance System (ISS) between the years of 2004 and 2009, were analyzed in this study. Unadjusted rate ratios (RR), compared incidence rates between categories of sex, injury mechanism, setting and competition level. We also examined sex-differences in head injury incidence rates, across categories of the other covariates. Multivariable logistic regression and negative binomial regression modeling tested the relation between sex and head injury corollaries, while controlling for contact, setting, and competition level.Between 2004 and 2009, head injuries accounted for approximately 11% of all soccer-related injuries reported within the NCAA-ISS. The rate of head injuries among women was higher than among men (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = [1.08, 1.41]). The rate of head injuries due to player-to-player contact was comparable between women and men (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.81, 1.11]).

The purpose of this study was to identify factors that contribute to head acceleration during soccer heading. One-hundred soccer players completed 12 controlled soccer headers. Peak linear (PLA) and rotational (PRA) accelerations were measured using a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope. Head acceleration contributing factors were grouped into 3 categories: size (head mass, neck girth), strength (sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius) and technique [kinematics (trunk, head-to-trunk range-of-motion), sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius activity]. Multiple regression analyses indicated size variables explained 22.1% of the variance in PLA and 23.3% of the variance in PRA; strength variables explained 13.3% of the variance in PLA and 17.2% of the variance in PRA; technique variables did not significantly predict PLA or PRA. These findings suggest that head and neck size and neck strength predict PLA and PRA. Anthropometric and neck strength measurements should be considered when determining an athlete’s readiness to begin soccer heading.","The paper investigates the relationship between head and neck size and neck strength with the acceleration experienced during soccer heading.

External Match Loads of Footballers With Cerebral Palsy: A Comparison Among Sport Classes,2017-10-16,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Javier Yanci, Daniel Castillo, Aitor Iturricastillo, Tomás Urbán, Raúl Reina","Purpose : To determine and compare the external match load, according to sport class (FT), of footballers with cerebral palsy (CP) during the International Federation of CP Football World Championships Qualification Tournament. Methods : Forty-two international male footballers with CP participated in the data collection. The footballers with CP were classified according to their FT into 3 groups (ie, FT5/6, FT7, and FT8). External match load (ie, total distance covered, distance covered at different speeds, accelerations, decelerations, player load, peak metabolic power, and changes of directions) was collected for both halves during official matches with global positioning system devices. Results : Players with lower impairment (FT8) covered more distance (effect size = 0.30–0.60) at high-intensity running (13.0–18.0 km·h −1 ) and sprinting (&gt;18.0 km·h −1 ) and performed more (effect size = 0.29–1.08) accelerations, decelerations, and changes of direction at high intensity in matches than did other players (ie, FT5/6 and FT7 groups). Conclusion : Because high-intensity actions are relevant to football performance and there are differences caused by players’ impairments, the International Federation of CP Football classification protocols should include high-intensity actions during the technical assessment as part of the procedures for determining the sport class of football players with CP.","This paper investigates the external match loads of footballers with cerebral palsy (CP) during a tournament, comparing data across different sport classes (FT5/6, FT7, and FT8).

Neuromuscular Adaptations to Multimodal Injury Prevention Programs in Youth Sports: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,2017-10-12,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Oliver Faude, Roland Rössler, Erich J. Petushek, Ralf Roth, Lukas Zahner, Lars Donath","Objective: Neuromuscular injury prevention programs (IPP) can reduce injury rate by about 40% in youth sport. Multimodal IPP include, for instance, balance, strength, power, and agility exercises. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of multimodal IPP on neuromuscular performance in youth sports. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search including selected search terms related to youth sports, injury prevention, and neuromuscular performance. Inclusion criteria were: (i) the study was a (cluster-)randomized controlled trial (RCT), and (ii) investigated healthy participants, up to 20 years of age and involved in organized sport, (iii) an intervention arm performing a multimodal IPP was compared to a control arm following a common training regime, and (iv) neuromuscular performance parameters (e.g., balance, power, strength, sprint) were assessed. Furthermore, we evaluated IPP effects on sport-specific skills. Results: Fourteen RCTs (comprising 704 participants) were analyzed. Eight studies included only males, and five only females. Seventy-one percent of all studies investigated soccer players with basketball, field hockey, futsal, Gaelic football, and hurling being the remaining sports. The average age of the participants ranged from 10 years up to 19 years and the level of play from recreational to professional. Intervention durations ranged from 4 weeks to 4.5 months with a total of 12 to 57 training sessions. We observed a small overall effect in favor of IPP for balance/stability (Hedges' g = 0.37; 95%CI 0.17, 0.58), leg power (g = 0.22; 95%CI 0.07, 0.38), and isokinetic hamstring and quadriceps strength as well as hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (g = 0.38; 95%CI 0.21, 0.55). We found a large overall effect for sprint abilities (g = 0.80; 95%CI 0.50, 1.09) and sport-specific skills (g = 0.83; 95%CI 0.34, 1.32). Subgroup analyses revealed larger effects in high-level (g = 0.34-1.18) compared to low-level athletes (g = 0.22-0.75), in boys (g = 0.27-1.02) compared to girls (g = 0.09-0.38), in older (g = 0.32-1.16) compared to younger athletes (g = 0.18-0.51), and in studies with high (g = 0.35-1.16) compared to low (g = 0.12-0.38) overall number of training sessions. Conclusion: Multimodal IPP beneficially affect neuromuscular performance. These improvements may substantiate the preventative efficacy of IPP and may support the wide-spread implementation and dissemination of IPP. The study has been a priori registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016053407).","This paper systematically reviews and analyzes the effects of multimodal injury prevention programs (IPP) on neuromuscular performance in youth sports, revealing that such programs can reduce injury rates and enhance key performance metrics like balance, power, and sprinting.

The study findings suggest that women may utilize a feedforward control strategy in which they activate their knee extensors earlier than men to compensate for deficits in hip extensor RTD. The impaired capacity to rapidly stabilize the hip and knee joints during dynamic maneuvers may contribute to the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury observed in women.","This study investigates gender differences in the rate of torque development (RTD) of the hip and knee extensors during a drop-jump task, highlighting that women exhibit lower normalized RTD of the hip extensors yet show earlier activation of the vastus lateralis and gluteus maximus compared to men.

Players with lower extremity overuse injuries were identified through weekly emails and were interviewed by telephone to obtain data on injury type and body region. We evaluated the association between overuse injuries and preseason risk factors, including joint hypermobility, hip and knee muscle strength, and jump biomechanics, using Poisson regression to estimate relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs.The incidence rate for first-time lower extremity overuse injuries was 1.7 per 1000 athlete-exposure hours (AEH; 95% CI, 1.4-2.2), and that for repeat injuries was 3.4 per 1000 AEH (95% CI, 2.1-5.6). Knee injuries accounted for 47% of overuse injuries. Increased valgus was associated with a 3.2-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.52-6.71) for knee injury. A 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in hamstring strength was associated with a 35% decreased risk (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.91) for overuse knee injuries, and a 1-SD increase in quadriceps strength was associated with a 30% decreased risk (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98). A 1-SD increase in hip flexor strength was associated with a 28% decreased risk (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.00) for overuse knee injuries, and a 1-SD increase in external rotation strength was associated with a 35% decreased risk (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.91).

Y-PLAN showed significant differences only between U12 and the other groups (P<0.01). ICODT results were significantly different between the groups U12 and U14 and the other groups (P<0.01). Significant Pearson's correlations between Y-TEST and ICODT, for the three categories of young players (0.398 P<0.05; 0.615 P<0.01; 0.608 P<0.01 respectively), were found, whereas no significant correlation was found in U18 group.The best performance of Y-PLAN and ICODT, through age, depends on physical skill level, whereas the best RA results depend on technique and experience that help the players to use anticipatory skill. The high correlations between CODS and RA performances, differently than adult athletes, suggest that an effective work program for young players may include RA and CODS training at the same time.","This study investigates the differences in agility and change of direction speed (CODS) among soccer players aged U12, U14, U16, and U18 to optimize training methods. The findings indicate significant age-related differences in performance, with younger players showing distinct capabilities and correlations between reactive agility and CODS, suggesting that training programs for youth should integrate these skills simultaneously."
Construct validity of tests that measure kick performance for young soccer players based on cluster analysis: exploring the relationship between coaches rating and actual measures,2017-10-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Luiz H. Palucci Vieira, Vitor L. de Andrade, Rodrigo L. Aquino, Renato Moraes, Fabio A. Barbieri, Sérgio A. Cunha, Bruno L. Bedo, Paulo R. Santiago","The main aim of this study was to verify the relationship between the classification of coaches and actual performance in field tests that measure the kicking performance in young soccer players, using the K-means clustering technique.Twenty-three U-14 players performed 8 tests to measure their kicking performance. Four experienced coaches provided a rating for each player as follows: 1: poor; 2: below average; 3: average; 4: very good; 5: excellent as related to three parameters (i.e. accuracy, power and ability to put spin on the ball).The scores interval established from k-means cluster metric was useful to originating five groups of performance level, since ANOVA revealed significant differences between clusters generated (P<0.01). Accuracy seems to be moderately predicted by the penalty kick, free kick, kicking the ball rolling and Wall Volley Test (0.44≤r≤0.56), while the ability to put spin on the ball can be measured by the free kick and the corner kick tests (0.52≤r≤0.61). Body measurements, age and PHV did not systematically influence the performance. The Wall Volley Test seems to be a good predictor of other tests.Five tests showed reasonable construct validity and can be used to predict the accuracy (penalty kick, free kick, kicking a rolling ball and Wall Volley Test) and ability to put spin on the ball (free kick and corner kick tests) when kicking in soccer. In contrast, the goal kick, kicking the ball when airborne and the vertical kick tests exhibited low power of discrimination and using them should be viewed with caution.","This study investigates the relationship between coaches' ratings and actual kicking performance in young soccer players through K-means clustering analysis. It identifies five field tests that reliably predict kicking accuracy and the ability to put spin on the ball, while cautioning against the use of other tests that showed low discrimination power."
Functional performance 6 months after ACL reconstruction can predict return to participation in the same preinjury activity level 12 and 24 months after surgery,2017-09-27,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Zakariya Nawasreh, David Logerstedt, Kathleen Cummer, Michael Axe, May Arna Risberg, Lynn Snyder-Mackler","Assessing athletes' readiness is a key component for successful outcomes after ACL reconstruction (ACLR).To investigate whether return-to-activity criteria, individually or in combination, at 6 months after ACLR can predict return to participation in the same preinjury activity level at 12 and 24 months after ACLR.Ninety-five level I/II participants completed return-to-activity criteria testing (isometric quadriceps index, single-legged hop tests, Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS) and Global Rating Score (GRS)) at 6 months after ACLR. The PASS group was defined as scoring >90% on all criteria and the FAIL group as scoring <90% on any criteria. At 12 and 24 months after ACLR, participants were asked if they had returned to participate in the same preinjury activity level or not. All return-to-activity criteria, except quadriceps index, were entered into the logistic regression model.81% and 84.4% of the PASS group returned to participation in the same preinjury activity level, while only 44.2% and 46.4% of the FAIL group returned at 12 and 24 months, respectively, after ACLR. The 6-meter timed hop, single hop and triple hop limb symmetry indexes; GRS; and KOS-ADLS individually predicted the outcome of interest at 12 months after ACLR (range: R2: 0.12-0.22, p<0.024). In combination, they explained 27% of the variance (p=0.035). All hop tests, individually, predicted the outcome of interest at 24 months after ACLR (range: R2: 0.26-0.37; p<0.007); in combination they explained 45% of the variance (p<0.001).Return to participation in the same preinjury activity level at 12 and 24 months after ACLR was higher in those who passed the criteria compared with those who failed. Individual and combined return-to-activity criteria predicted the outcomes of interest, with the hop tests as consistent predictors at 12 and 24 months after ACLR.","This paper investigates the relationship between functional performance at 6 months post-ACL reconstruction and the likelihood of returning to preinjury activity levels at 12 and 24 months after surgery. It finds that athletes meeting specific return-to-activity criteria, particularly in hop tests, are significantly more likely to return to their prior activity levels, with combined criteria explaining up to 45% of the variance in outcomes."
Characteristics and Outcomes of Arthroscopic Femoroacetabular Impingement Surgery in the National Football League,2017-09-26,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Benedict U. Nwachukwu, Asheesh Bedi, Ajay Premkumar, Pete Draovitch, Bryan T. Kelly","Previous studies have reported that hip abnormalities may account for 10% of injuries in professional football players. The effect of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and arthroscopic FAI surgery in National Football League (NFL) athletes has not been well studied.To investigate the effect of arthroscopic FAI surgery on return to play (RTP) and RTP performance in NFL players.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.NFL athletes undergoing arthroscopic FAI surgery at a single institution between 2006 and 2014 were identified. Medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and operative variables. RTP and RTP performance were assessed based on a review of publicly available NFL player statistics. RTP and RTP performance data included time to RTP; games played before and after the injury; yearly total yards and touchdowns for offensive players; and yearly total tackles, sacks, and interceptions for defensive players. The offensive power rating (OPR = [total yards/10] + [total touchdowns × 6]) and defensive power rating (DPR = total tackles + [total sacks × 2] + [total interceptions × 2]) were calculated. Paired t tests comparing preinjury and postinjury seasons were performed. A matched cohort of NFL players was created to compare trends for OPR, DPR, and career longevity.Forty-eight hips in 40 NFL players (mean age, 25.6 years) with symptomatic FAI were included; 8 players underwent staged bilateral hip arthroscopic procedures. The majority of players were offensive (n = 24; 60.0%), with offensive lineman (n = 11; 27.5%) being the most common of all positions. Of the 48 included hips, all had labral tears, and 41 (85.4%) underwent labral repair. Forty-two of the 48 hips (87.5%) underwent cam decompression, and 10 (20.8%) underwent rim decompression. Of the 40 included players, 37 (92.5%) achieved RTP to professional competition after their hip arthroscopic surgery at a mean of 6.0 months. Before the injury, included patients played in a mean of 11.0 games compared with 9.5 games in their postoperative season ( P = .26). The mean OPR and DPR demonstrated a nonsignificant decline in the postoperative season (preinjury OPR, 40.2; postinjury OPR, 32.3; P = .34) (preinjury DPR, 49.6; postinjury DPR, 36.4; P = .10). A similar decline in the OPR and DPR across seasons was observed in the control group. NFL athletes played, on average, 3.3 ± 1.5 seasons after undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery; this was not significantly different from the controls (2.5 ± 1.5 seasons; P = .47). There was no significant difference in mean annual salaries based on contracts negotiated before the injury and the first negotiated contract after surgery ($3.3 million vs $3.6 million, respectively; P = .58).There was a very high rate of RTP in the NFL after arthroscopic FAI surgery; this rate is higher than what has been previously reported for other orthopaedic procedures in NFL athletes. Additionally, these NFL athletes achieved RTP at a faster time frame (6 months) than previously reported for other procedures. These findings have important implications for counseling elite football players about the expected outcome of arthroscopic FAI surgery.","This paper investigates the outcomes of arthroscopic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) surgery in NFL athletes, focusing on return to play (RTP) and performance metrics before and after surgery. The study finds a high RTP rate (92.5%) and a comparatively quick recovery timeframe of 6 months, although no significant changes were observed in performance metrics post-surgery."
Head impact exposure measured in a single youth football team during practice drills,2017-09-22,Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group (JNSPG),Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics,"Mireille E. Kelley, Joeline M. Kane, Mark A. Espeland, Logan E. Miller, Alexander K. Powers, Joel D. Stitzel, Jillian E. Urban","OBJECTIVE This study evaluated the frequency, magnitude, and location of head impacts in practice drills within a youth football team to determine how head impact exposure varies among different types of drills. METHODS On-field head impact data were collected from athletes participating in a youth football team for a single season. Each athlete wore a helmet instrumented with a Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System head acceleration measurement device during all preseason, regular season, and playoff practices. Video was recorded for all practices, and video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each head impact to a specific drill. Eleven drills were identified: dummy/sled tackling, install, special teams, Oklahoma, one-on-one, open-field tackling, passing, position skill work, multiplayer tackle, scrimmage, and tackling drill stations. Generalized linear models were fitted to log-transformed data, and Wald tests were used to assess differences in head accelerations and impact rates. RESULTS A total of 2125 impacts were measured during 30 contact practices in 9 athletes (mean age 11.1 ± 0.6 years, mean mass 44.9 ± 4.1 kg). Open-field tackling had the highest median and 95th percentile linear accelerations (24.7 g and 97.8 g , respectively) and resulted in significantly higher mean head accelerations than several other drills. The multiplayer tackle drill resulted in the highest head impact frequency, with an average of 0.59 impacts per minute per athlete, but the lowest 95th percentile linear accelerations of all drills. The front of the head was the most common impact location for all drills except dummy/sled tackling. CONCLUSIONS Head impact exposure varies significantly in youth football practice drills, with several drills exposing athletes to high-magnitude and/or high-frequency head impacts. These data suggest that further study of practice drills is an important step in developing evidence-based recommendations for modifying or eliminating certain high-intensity drills to reduce head impact exposure and injury risk for all levels of play.","This study investigates the frequency, magnitude, and location of head impacts during practice drills in a youth football team. It finds that different drills, particularly open-field tackling, expose athletes to varying levels of head impact, highlighting the need for evidence-based modifications to reduce injury risk."
A Test Bed to Examine Helmet Fit and Retention and Biomechanical Measures of Head and Neck Injury in Simulated Impact,2017-09-21,MyJove Corporation,Journal of Visualized Experiments,"Henry Y. Yu, Brooklynn M. Knowles, Christopher R. Dennison","Conventional wisdom and the language in international helmet testing and certification standards suggest that appropriate helmet fit and retention during an impact are important factors in protecting the helmet wearer from impact-induced injury. This manuscript aims to investigate impact-induced injury mechanisms in different helmet fit scenarios through analysis of simulated helmeted impacts with an anthropometric test device (ATD), an array of headform acceleration transducers and neck force/moment transducers, a dual high speed camera system, and helmet-fit force sensors developed in our research group based on Bragg gratings in optical fiber. To simulate impacts, an instrumented headform and flexible neck fall along a linear guide rail onto an anvil. The test bed allows simulation of head impact at speeds up to 8.3 m/s, onto impact surfaces that are both flat and angled. The headform is fit with a crash helmet and several fit scenarios can be simulated by making context specific adjustments to the helmet position index and/or helmet size. To quantify helmet retention, the movement of the helmet on the head is quantified using post-hoc image analysis. To quantify head and neck injury potential, biomechanical measures based on headform acceleration and neck force/moment are measured. These biomechanical measures, through comparison with established human tolerance curves, can estimate the risk of severe life threatening and/or mild diffuse brain injury and osteoligamentous neck injury. To our knowledge, the presented test-bed is the first developed specifically to assess biomechanical effects on head and neck injury relative to helmet fit and retention.","The paper investigates the impact-induced injury mechanisms related to helmet fit and retention during simulated impacts. It features a novel test bed designed to analyze head and neck injury risks through biomechanical measures, including headform acceleration and neck forces, under various helmet fit scenarios."

Dvorak, E. Lichtenstein, O. Faude","Football (soccer) is very popular among children. Little is known about risk factors for football injuries in children. The aim was to analyze potential injury risk factors in 7‐ to 12‐year‐old players. We collected prospective data in Switzerland and the Czech Republic over two seasons. Coaches reported exposure of players (in hours), absence, and injury data via an Internet‐based registration system. We analyzed time‐to‐injury data with extended Cox models accounting for correlations on team‐ and intra‐person levels. We analyzed injury risk in relation to age, sex, playing position, preferred foot, and regarding age‐independent body height, body mass, and BMI . Further, we analyzed injury risk in relation to playing surface. In total, 6038 player seasons with 395 295 hours of football exposure were recorded and 417 injuries occurred. Injury risk increased by 46% (Hazard Ratio 1.46 [1.35; 1.58]; P &lt; .001) per year of life. Left‐footed players had a higher injury risk (Hazard Ratio 1.53 [1.07; 2.19]; P = .02) for training injuries compared to right‐footed players. Injury risk was increased in age‐adjusted taller players (higher percentile rank). Higher match‐training ratios were associated with a lower risk of match injuries. Injury risk was increased on artificial turf (Rate Ratio 1.39 [1.12; 1.73]; P &lt; .001) and lower during indoor sessions (Rate Ratio 0.68 [0.52; 0.88]; P &lt; .001) compared to natural grass. Age is known as a risk factor in older players and was confirmed to be a risk factor in children's football. Playing surface and leg dominance have also been discussed previously as risk factors. Differences in injury risks in relation to sex should be investigated in the future.","This paper investigates the risk factors for football injuries in young players aged 7 to 12 years, analyzing data from Switzerland and the Czech Republic over two seasons. Key findings indicate that injury risk increases with age and is higher among left-footed players and taller individuals, while factors such as playing surface and match-training ratios also influence injury incidences."
The Energy Cost of Running with the Ball in Soccer,2017-09-18,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Alessandro Piras, Milena Raffi, Charalampos Atmatzidis, Franco Merni, Rocco Di Michele","Running with the ball is a soccer-specific activity frequently used by players during match play and training drills. Nevertheless, the energy cost (EC) of on-grass running with the ball has not yet been determined. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the EC of constant-speed running with the ball, and to compare it with the EC of normal running. Eight amateur soccer players performed two 6- min runs at 10 km/h on artificial turf, respectively with and without the ball. EC was measured with indirect calorimetry and, furthermore, estimated with a method based on players' accelerations measured with a GPS receiver. The EC measured with indirect calorimetry was higher in running with the ball (4.60±0.42 J/kg/m) than in normal running (4.19±0.33 J/kg/m), with a very likely moderate difference between conditions. Instead, a likely small difference was observed between conditions for EC estimated from GPS data (4.87±0.07 vs. 4.83±0.08 J/kg/m). This study sheds light on the energy expenditure of playing soccer, providing relevant data about the EC of a typical soccer-specific activity. These findings may be a reference for coaches to precisely determine the training load in drills with the ball, such as soccer-specific circuits or small-sided games.","This paper investigates the energy cost (EC) associated with running while dribbling a soccer ball compared to normal running. The study finds that the EC is higher when running with the ball, which could help coaches optimize training loads during soccer drills and games."

Though ankle tapings are regularly employed, the effect of tape application on lower extremity biomechanics is not fully known. <h3>Methods and Measures</h3> Twenty-eight participants (14 healthy, 14 with chronic ankle instability [CAI]) performed drop landings from a box of 60 cm height (3 before and 3 after traditional ankle taping application). An infrared optical camera system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd. Oxford, UK) and force-plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA) collected kinematic and kinetic data during drop landing. Stiffness and sagittal angle of the ankle, knee, and hip between initial contact (IC) and maximum knee flexion angle were analysed. <h3>Results</h3> Sagittal angle of ankle was statistically decreased [Healthy: p&lt;0.05; M±SD: 56.38±55.56(pre), 49.31±5.30(post); CAI: p&lt;0.05; M±SD: 53.12±7.08(pre), 47.68±6.85(post)], while sagittal angles of the knee [Healthy: p&gt;0.05; M±SD: 53.43±8.21(pre), 52.68±7.92(post); CAI: p&gt;0.05; M±SD: 53.26±7.47(pre), 55.16±9.40(post)]and hip [Healthy: p&gt;0.05; M±SD: 30.00±8.62(pre), 30.42±9.16(post); CAI: p&gt;0.05; M±SD: 29.42±6.30(pre), 31.10±7.13(post)] were not significantly changed after taping.

These findings indicate possible changes in the shock absorption mechanism during landing following ankle tape. Therefore, clinicians may need to consider potential changes in proximal joint movement strategies to attenuate shock during landing following ankle tape application and how this may impact athletic performance or injury risk.","The paper investigates the effects of ankle taping on joint stiffness and angles in the lower extremity during drop landings. Results indicate that ankle taping decreases the ankle joint angle while increasing ankle stiffness, while also reducing stiffness in the knee and hip joints, suggesting implications for injury risk and shock absorption strategies during landing."

Experienced soccer athletes, ballet dancers, and nonathletes performed (a) a Rod and Frame test and (b) a 100-s bipedal stance task during which vision and proprioception were successively or concurrently disrupted in 20-s blocks. Postural adaptation was assessed in the mean center of pressure displacement, root mean square of center of pressure velocity and ankle muscles integrated electromyography activity. Soccer athletes were more field dependent than were nonathletes. During standing, dancers were more destabilized by vibration and required more time to reweigh sensory information compared with the other 2 groups.

Development of a low cost force platform for biomechanical parameters analysis,2017-09-06,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Research on Biomedical Engineering,"Marcelo Guimarães Silva, Pedro Vieira Sarmet Moreira, Henrique Martins Rocha","Introduction: The maintenance of balance and body orientation during standing is essential to perform different activities. One of the devices used to measure balance them is the force platform. This device measures the ground reaction force (GRF) and displacement of the center of pressure (COP), both biomechanical parameters involved in human motion. This article proposes a new design for non-commercial low-cost force platforms for scientific research purposes. Methods for calibration and validation are also described. Methods A force platform, developed according to International Standards of Measurement and dedicated to measuring feet contact forces was built for approximately one tenth of the cost of commercial platforms. Calibration was performed by loading known masses, centralized or distributed, on the platform. An experimental study was conducted with four volunteers in different conditions to validate and verify the practical applicability of the device. Results The platform calibration showed an adequate connectivity, linearity and reliable measurement of the variables proposed in this research, being suitable for studies of human postural behavior. Conclusion Based on the validation results, we believe the low-cost platform can be used as stabilometric device to measure postural control and balance in clinical or sports experiments. However future studies will be required to provide a final validation and compare its performance with other force platforms.","This paper presents the development of a low-cost force platform designed to measure ground reaction forces and center of pressure displacements, which are critical for assessing balance during standing activities.

Differences in hamstring activation characteristics between the acceleration and maximum-speed phases of sprinting,2017-09-05,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Ayako Higashihara, Yasuharu Nagano, Takashi Ono, Toru Fukubayashi","This study aimed to investigate activation characteristics of the biceps femoris long head (BFlh) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles during the acceleration and maximum-speed phases of sprinting. Lower-extremity kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activities of the BFlh and ST muscles were examined during the acceleration sprint and maximum-speed sprint in 13 male sprinters during an overground sprinting. Differences in hamstring activation during each divided phases and in the hip and knee joint angles and torques at each time point of the sprinting gait cycle were determined between two sprints. During the early stance of the acceleration sprint, the hip extension torque was significantly greater than during the maximum-speed sprint, and the relative EMG activation of the BFlh muscle was significantly higher than that of the ST muscle. During the late stance and terminal mid-swing of maximum-speed sprint, the knee was more extended and a higher knee flexion moment was observed compared to the acceleration sprint, and the ST muscle showed higher activation than that of the BFlh. These results indicate that the functional demands of the medial and lateral hamstring muscles differ between two different sprint performances.","This study examines the activation characteristics of the biceps femoris long head and semitendinosus muscles during the acceleration and maximum-speed phases of sprinting.

What Is the Most Effective Training Approach for Preventing Noncontact ACL Injuries in High School–Aged Female Athletes?,2017-09-05,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Erica M. Willadsen, Andrea B. Zahn, Chris J. Durall","Clinical Scenario : A variety of training approaches have been adopted in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prevention programs, including neuromuscular control training, core stability training, balance training, and plyometric exercise. This review was conducted to determine if current evidence supports one of these training approaches over the others for reducing noncontact ACL injuries in adolescent female athletes. Focused Clinical Question : What is the most effective training approach for preventing noncontact ACL injuries in adolescent and/or high school–aged female athletes? Summary of Key Findings : A literature search generated 2 level 1b randomized control trials and 1 level 2b cohort study. Plyometric training resulted in decreased knee valgus during landing in 3 studies and increased knee flexion at landing in 2 studies. Balance training or neuromuscular training led to decreased knee valgus and increased knee-flexion angles with landing in 2 studies. Core stability training had conflicting effects on knee valgus and knee-flexion angles at landing, with 1 study reporting no effect and another reporting an undesirable decrease in knee joint flexion angle at landing. Clinical Bottom Line : Based on this review, plyometric training, balance training, and neuromuscular training approaches appear sensible to include in ACL prevention programs for female athletes to help decrease knee valgus and knee flexion during landing. Core stability training may be somewhat beneficial for decreasing knee valgus angles at landing, although may have nominal or even deleterious effects on knee-flexion angle at landing, and thus should be implemented with caution. Strength of Recommendation : Our recommendations were derived from the results of 2 level 1b randomized control trials and 1 level 2b cohort study.","The paper examines various training approaches for preventing noncontact ACL injuries in high school-aged female athletes, focusing on the effectiveness of methods such as plyometric, balance, and neuromuscular training. The findings suggest that plyometric and balance training are effective in reducing knee valgus and enhancing knee flexion at landing, while core stability training may have mixed or negative effects on knee flexion and should be approached cautiously."

ACL Injury Prevention Training Results in Modification of Hip and Knee Mechanics During a Drop-Landing Task,2017-09-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Christine D. Pollard, Susan M. Sigward, Christopher M. Powers","Injury prevention training has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury; however, the underlying reason for the success of these training programs is unclear.To investigate whether an ACL injury prevention program that has been shown to reduce the incidence of ACL injury alters sagittal plane hip and knee biomechanics during a drop-landing task.Descriptive laboratory study.Thirty female club soccer players (age range, 11-17 years) with no history of knee injury participated in this study. Kinematics and ground-reaction forces were collected while each participant performed a drop-landing task prior to and immediately after participation in a 12-week ACL injury prevention training program.After ACL injury prevention training, participants demonstrated decreased knee extensor moments (P = .03), increased energy absorption at the hip (P = .04), decreased knee-to-hip extensor moment ratios (P = .05), and decreased knee-to-hip energy absorption ratios (P = .03).Participation in an ACL injury prevention training program decreased reliance on the knee extensor muscles and improved use of the hip extensor muscles, which may explain the protective effect of this type of training program on ACL injury.Based on these findings, clinicians can better understand how ACL injury prevention training, such as the Prevent Injury and Enhance Performance (PEP) Program, may change movement behavior at both the hip and knee. Furthermore, the study findings may support the implementation of the PEP Program, or a similar program, for clinicians aiming to improve use of the hip in an effort to reduce knee loading and consequent injuries.","The paper investigates the effects of an ACL injury prevention training program on hip and knee biomechanics during a drop-landing task among female soccer players. Results indicate that the training led to decreased reliance on knee extensor muscles and improved hip extensor muscle usage, which may explain its protective effect against ACL injuries."
Preseason Aerobic Fitness Predicts In-Season Injury and Illness in Female Youth Athletes,2017-09-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Andrew Watson, Stacey Brickson, M. Alison Brooks, Warren Dunn","Background:Although preseason aerobic fitness has been suggested as a modifiable risk factor for injury in adult athletes, the relationship between aerobic fitness, injury, and illness in youth athletes is unknown. Purpose:To determine whether preseason aerobic fitness predicts in-season injury and illness risk in female adolescent soccer players. Methods:Fifty-four female adolescent soccer players underwent preseason evaluation to determine years of experience, body mass index (BMI), maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max), and time to exhaustion (Tmax) during cycle ergometer testing. All injuries and illnesses during the subsequent 20-week season were recorded. Variables were compared between individuals with and without a self-reported injury and individuals with and without a self-reported illness. Separate Poisson regression models were developed to predict number of injuries and illnesses for each individual by use of age, years of experience, BMI, VO2max, and Tmax. Results:Twenty-eight injuries and 38 illnesses in 23 individuals were recorded during the season. Although not a statistically significant finding, individuals who reported an in-season injury had lower VO2max than those who did not (54.9 ± 7.3 vs 58.3 ± 8.5 mL/kg/min, P = .13). Individuals who reported an illness had significantly lower VO2max than those who did not (54.5 ± 9.9 vs 58.8 ± 6.2 mL/kg/min, P = .014). With the Poisson regression models, VO2max was a significant predictor of both injury (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; P = .046) and illness (OR, 0.94; P = .009), while no significant relationships were identified between injury or illness and age, years of experience, Tmax, or BMI (all P > .05). Conclusion:Among adolescent female soccer players, greater preseason aerobic fitness is associated with a reduced risk of in-season injury and illness. Off-season intervention to promote aerobic fitness may help reduce the risk of lost time during the season due to injury and illness.","The paper investigates the relationship between preseason aerobic fitness and the risk of injury and illness in female youth soccer players. It finds that greater preseason VO2max is associated with a decreased risk of in-season injuries and illnesses, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving aerobic fitness could be beneficial for athlete health."
Prognostic factors for specific lower extremity and spinal musculoskeletal injuries identified through medical screening and training load monitoring in professional football (soccer): a systematic review,2017-09-01,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Tom Hughes, Jamie C Sergeant, Matthew J Parkes, Michael J Callaghan","Medical screening and load monitoring procedures are commonly used in professional football to assess factors perceived to be associated with injury.To identify prognostic factors (PFs) and models for lower extremity and spinal musculoskeletal injuries in professional/elite football players from medical screening and training load monitoring processes.The MEDLINE, AMED, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, SPORTDiscus and PubMed electronic bibliographic databases were searched (from inception to January 2017). Prospective and retrospective cohort studies of lower extremity and spinal musculoskeletal injury incidence in professional/elite football players aged between 16 and 40 years were included. The Quality in Prognostic Studies appraisal tool and the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation synthesis approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence.Fourteen studies were included. 16 specific lower extremity injury outcomes were identified. No spinal injury outcomes were identified. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity and study quality. All evidence related to PFs and specific lower extremity injury outcomes was of very low to low quality. On the few occasions where multiple studies could be used to compare PFs and outcomes, only two factors demonstrated consensus. A history of previous hamstring injuries (HSI) and increasing age may be prognostic for future HSI in male players.The assumed ability of medical screening tests to predict specific musculoskeletal injuries is not supported by the current evidence. Screening procedures should currently be considered as benchmarks of function or performance only. The prognostic value of load monitoring modalities is unknown.","This paper systematically reviews the prognostic factors associated with lower extremity and spinal musculoskeletal injuries in professional football, utilizing medical screening and training load monitoring data.

The behavioural modification program is based on analysing each player's head impact biomechanics. <h3>Methods and Approach</h3> In a clustered quasi-experimental study design, the intervention was provided to two out of three teams in year one, and two out of four teams in year two. All four teams will receive the intervention in year three. Impacts were measured using in-helmet accelerometers worn by all players. Impact data and game video were used to identify 'high risk' players on intervention teams to receive individualised mentoring. Mentoring effects were evaluated using head impact data. Coach and player satisfaction were assessed to evaluate the program's acceptability and impact. <h3>Results</h3> In total, 142 athletes (63 intervention; 69 control) have participated to date. Of these, 18 (25.8%) were classified 'high risk', with playing techniques amenable to intervention. On average, the proportion of head impacts classified as high-magnitude (&gt;60 g) dropped 3.9% from pre to post-intervention in mentored players. The proportion of top-of-head impacts (considered a high-risk impact zone) dropped 4.7%. There was minimal (&lt;1%) change on these measures in non-mentored players. In post-season exit surveys, all mentored players either 'strongly agreed' (56%) or 'agreed' (44%) that his playing behaviours improved because of the study. All intervention team coaches thought the study was 'very effective' (n=6, 40%) or 'effective' (n=9, 60%) in changing playing behaviour. <h3>Conclusions</h3> To a modest degree, mentoring decreased impacts associated with increased concussion risk.

Evaluation of Isokinetic Single-Leg Cycling as a Rehabilitation Exercise Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery,2017-08-31,MDPI AG,Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology,"Randolph Hutchison, Jessica Myers, Nicholas Hayden, Lee Shearer, Kaitlin Bruneau, John DesJardins","The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments, with over 250,000 injuries per year in the United States. Previous studies have found that ACL-deficient individuals avoid use of the quadriceps in the injured limb as a means of limiting anterior movement of the tibia in the absence of a functioning ACL. From these results, a study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of isokinetic single-leg cycling in increasing quadriceps muscle recruitment and activation. Ten control and seven ACL-reconstructed subjects completed a series of 15 s cycling trials in isokinetic mode at 75 rpm, while kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data of the lower limbs were collected, with the trials including both double-leg and single-leg cycling. It was hypothesized that there would be an increase in quadriceps muscle activity, peak knee extensor moment, and knee joint power in single-leg cycling when compared to double-leg cycling. The results of the study suggest that single-leg cycling may be an effective exercise in increasing the strength of the quadriceps following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery. Although no significant changes occurred, the results indicate that, given a specific limb power, more muscle force will be generated from the quadriceps muscle group in single-leg cycling than double-leg cycling.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of isokinetic single-leg cycling as a rehabilitation exercise for individuals recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.

Method: Peak torque (PT), angle of peak torque (APT), angle-specific torque (AST) analysed every 10° between 40° and 70°, functional range (FR), and dynamic control ratios (DCR) calculated from both the PT (DCRPT) and AST data (DCRAST) were analysed. Results: The PT, APT, and FR data elicited significant contraction*angular velocity interactions (P < 0.001). Significant main effects for contraction*angular velocity*angle and contraction*angular velocity*limb*angle interactions (P ≤ 0.001) were identified for AST data. The DCRPT data elicited a significant main effect for angular velocity (P < 0.001) and limb (P = 0.018), whereas the DCRAST data were significantly different across angles (P < 0.001) and elicited a significant (P = 0.002) limb*angle interaction. Conclusion: Traditional analysis variables utilised for isokinetic strength assessments in football may not be appropriate and/or sensitive enough to identify injury risk. Practitioners should utilise the novel metrics proposed in the current study and conduct assessments across a range of joint angles and angular velocities.","This paper evaluates both traditional and novel isokinetic strength assessments of the knee muscles in professional football players through various contraction types at different angular velocities.

Gray, Brad W. Willis, Marjorie Skubic, Zhiyu Huo, Swithin Razu, Seth L. Sherman, Trent M. Guess, Amirhossein Jahandar, Trevor R. Gulbrandsen, Scott Miller, Nathan J. Siesener","Background: Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in adolescent female athletes is an increasing problem. The knee-ankle separation ratio (KASR), calculated at initial contact (IC) and peak flexion (PF) during the drop vertical jump (DVJ), is a measure of dynamic knee valgus. The Microsoft Kinect V2 has shown promise as a reliable and valid marker-less motion capture device. Hypothesis: The Kinect V2 will demonstrate good to excellent correlation between KASR results at IC and PF during the DVJ, as compared with a “gold standard” Vicon motion analysis system. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Level of Evidence: Level 2. Methods: Thirty-eight healthy volunteer subjects (20 male, 18 female) performed 5 DVJ trials, simultaneously measured by a Vicon MX-T40S system, 2 AMTI force platforms, and a Kinect V2 with customized software. A total of 190 jumps were completed. The KASR was calculated at IC and PF during the DVJ. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) assessed the degree of KASR agreement between the Kinect and Vicon systems. Results: The ICCs of the Kinect V2 and Vicon KASR at IC and PF were 0.84 and 0.95, respectively, showing excellent agreement between the 2 measures. The Kinect V2 successfully identified the KASR at PF and IC frames in 182 of 190 trials, demonstrating 95.8% reliability. Conclusion: The Kinect V2 demonstrated excellent ICC of the KASR at IC and PF during the DVJ when compared with the Vicon system. A customized Kinect V2 software program demonstrated good reliability in identifying the KASR at IC and PF during the DVJ.

Recent and Long-Term Soccer Heading Exposure Is Differentially Associated With Neuropsychological Function in Amateur Players,2017-08-22,Cambridge University Press (CUP),Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society,"Cara F. Levitch, Molly E. Zimmerman, Naomi Lubin, Namhee Kim, Richard B. Lipton, Walter F. Stewart, Mimi Kim, Michael L. Lipton","Abstract Objectives: The present study examined the relative contribution of recent or long-term heading to neuropsychological function in amateur adult soccer players. Participants and Methods: Soccer players completed a baseline questionnaire (HeadCount-12m) to ascertain heading during the prior 12 months (long-term heading, LTH) and an online questionnaire (HeadCount-2w) every 3 months to ascertain heading during the prior 2 weeks (recent heading, RH). Cogstate, a battery of six neuropsychological tests, was administered to assess neuropsychological function. Generalized estimating equations were used to test if LTH or RH was associated with neuropsychological function while accounting for the role of recognized concussion. Results: A total of 311 soccer players completed 630 HeadCount-2w. Participants had an average age of 26 years. Participants headed the ball a median of 611 times/year (mean=1,384.03) and 9.50 times/2 weeks (mean=34.17). High levels of RH were significantly associated with reduced performance on a task of psychomotor speed ( p =.02), while high levels of LTH were significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of verbal learning ( p =.03) and verbal memory ( p =.04). Significantly better attention ( p =.02) was detectable at moderately high levels of RH, but not at the highest level of RH. One hundred and seven (34.4%) participants reported a lifetime history of concussion, but this was not related to neuropsychological function and did not modify the association of RH or LTH with neuropsychological function. Conclusion: High levels of both RH and LTH were associated with poorer neuropsychological function, but on different domains. The clinical manifestations following repetitive exposure to heading could change with chronicity of exposure.

Finch, David Samra, Peter Baquie, Tanusha Cardoso, Danielle Hope, John W. Orchard","Context: The nature of Australian rules football (Australian football) predisposes both unique and common injuries compared with those sustained in other football codes. The game involves a combination of tackling, kicking, high-speed running (more than other football codes), and jumping. Two decades of injury surveillance has identified common injuries at the professional level (Australian Football League [AFL]). Objective: To provide an overview of injuries in Australian rules football, including injury rates, patterns, and mechanisms across all levels of play. Study Design: A narrative review of AFL injuries, football injury epidemiology, and biomechanical and physiological attributes of relevant injuries. Results: The overall injury incidence in the 2015 season was 41.7 injuries per club per season, with a prevalence of 156.2 missed games per club per season. Lower limb injuries are most prevalent, with hamstring strains accounting for 19.1 missed games per club per season. Hamstring strains relate to the volume of high-speed running required in addition to at times having to collect the ball while running in a position of hip flexion and knee extension. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are also prevalent and can result from contact and noncontact incidents. In the upper limb, shoulder sprains and dislocations account for 11.5 missed games per club per season and largely resulted from tackling and contact. Concussion is less common in AFL than other tackling sports but remains an important injury, which has notably become more prevalent in recent years, theorized to be due to a more conservative approach to management. Although there are less injury surveillance data for non-AFL players (women, community-level, children), many of these injuries appear to also be common across all levels of play. Clinical Relevance: An understanding of injury profiles and mechanisms in Australian football is crucial in identifying methods to reduce injury risk and prepare players for the demands of the game.","The paper provides a comprehensive overview of injury rates, patterns, and mechanisms in Australian Rules Football, emphasizing the unique injuries associated with the sport compared to other football codes.

Kinematic and neuromuscular relationships between lower extremity clinical movement assessments,2017-08-14,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Timothy C. Mauntel, Tyler R. Cram, Barnett S. Frank, Rebecca L. Begalle, Marc F. Norcross, J. Troy Blackburn, Darin A. Padua","Lower extremity injuries have immediate and long-term consequences. Lower extremity movement assessments can assist with identifying individuals at greater injury risk and guide injury prevention interventions. Movement assessments identify similar movement characteristics and evidence suggests large magnitude kinematic relationships exist between movement patterns observed across assessments; however, the magnitude of the relationships for electromyographic (EMG) measures across movement assessments remains largely unknown. This study examined relationships between lower extremity kinematic and EMG measures during jump landings and single leg squats. Lower extremity three-dimensional kinematic and EMG data were sampled from healthy adults (males = 20, females = 20) during the movement assessments. Pearson correlations examined the relationships of the kinematic and EMG measures and paired samples t-tests compared mean kinematic and EMG measures between the assessments. Overall, significant moderate correlations were observed for lower extremity kinematic (ravg = 0.41, rrange = 0.10-0.61) and EMG (ravg = 0.47, rrange = 0.32-0.80) measures across assessments. Kinematic and EMG measures were greater during the jump landings. Jump landings and single leg squats place different demands on the body and necessitate different kinematic and EMG patterns, such that these measures are not highly correlated between assessments. Clinicians should, therefore, use multiple assessments to identify aberrant movement and neuromuscular control patterns so that comprehensive interventions can be implemented.","This paper examines the relationships between lower extremity kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) measures during jump landings and single leg squats to identify individuals at higher injury risk. It highlights that while moderate correlations exist between kinematic and EMG measures, the different demands of each assessment suggest that multiple evaluations are necessary for effective injury prevention interventions."
Nutrition Status of Young Elite Female German Football Players,2017-08-08,Human Kinetics,Pediatric Exercise Science,"Hans Braun, Judith von Andrian-Werburg, Wilhelm Schänzer, Mario Thevis","Purpose: To investigate energy intake, energy expenditure, and the nutritional status of young female elite football players using 7-day food and activity records and blood parameters. Methods: A total of 56 female elite football players [14.8 (0.7) y] completed the requested food and activity protocols. Misreporting was assessed by the ratio of energy intake to energy expenditure. The food records were analyzed concerning energy and macronutrient and micronutrient intakes, and energy expenditure was calculated using predictive equations. Hematological data and 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations were determined. Results: Mean energy intake was 2262 (368) kcal/d [40.5 (7.0) kcal/kg/d] and estimated EE averaged 2403 (195) kcal/d. Fifty-three percent of the players exhibited an energy availability &lt;30 kcal/kg lean body mass; 31% of the athletes consumed &lt;5 g/kg carbohydrates and 34% consumed &lt;1.2 g/kg proteins.

Reliability of unipodal and bipodal counter movement jump landings in a recreational male population,2017-08-06,Wiley,European Journal of Sport Science,"Cédric Schwartz, Bénédicte Forthomme, Julien Paulus, Jean‐François Kaux, Olivier Brüls, Vincent Denoël, Jean‐Louis Croisier","Movement patterns during landing have been suggested to be related to injury risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the inter-session reliability of kinematic variables and ground reaction forces during landing in a population of male recreational athletes after a counter movement jump. Both unipodal and bipodal landings were evaluated. Furthermore, the possibility to improve landing reliability with a verbal instruction was also studied. Twenty-four male volunteers with no history of lower extremity trauma were randomly assigned to two groups (with and without verbal landing instruction). An optoelectronic 3D system and force plates were used to measure the lower limb joint angles and the ground reaction forces during landing. Intraclass correlation values show moderate to excellent inter-session reliability for the bipodal task (ICC average: 0.80, range: 0.46-0.97) and poor to excellent reliability for the unipodal task (ICC average: >0.75, range: 0.20-0.95). However, large standard errors of measurement values at the ankle joint at impact (27.6 ± 11.5°) and for the vertical ground reaction forces (394 ± 1091 N) show that some variables may not be usable in practice. The verbal instruction had a negative effect on the reliability of unipodal landing but improved the reliability of bipodal landing. These findings show that the reliability of a landing task is influenced by its motor complexity as well as the instruction given to the subject.","This study investigates the inter-session reliability of kinematic variables and ground reaction forces during unipodal and bipodal counter movement jump landings in recreational male athletes. It highlights the influence of motor complexity and verbal instructions on landing reliability, revealing moderate to excellent reliability for bipodal landings and mixed reliability for unipodal landings, with concerns about certain measurement variables' practical applicability."
Variability of Metabolic Power Data in Elite Soccer Players During Pre-Season Matches,2017-08-01,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Matthias Wilhelm Hoppe, Christian Baumgart, Mirko Slomka, Ted Polglaze, Jürgen Freiwald","Abstract This study aimed to determine the within-subject variability of GPS-derived metabolic power data in elite soccer players across several pre-season matches and compare the variability of high metabolic power, velocity, acceleration and deceleration running. Additionally, differences in metabolic power data among playing positions and relationships with various physical abilities were also investigated. Metabolic power data from 12 outfield starting players competing in the German Bundesliga were collected during five pre-season matches using GPS-technology (10 Hz). The players were also tested for speed, agility, power and intermittent endurance. Variability of global metabolic power data such as energy expenditure (CV = 2.2-7.0%) was lower than that for high-intensity including time ≥20 W·kg -1 (CV = 14.0-26.2%). Variability of high metabolic power (≥20 W·kg -1 ; CV = 14.1 ± 3.5%) was comparable to that of high velocity (≥15.5 km·h -1 ; CV = 17.0 ± 6.2%), acceleration (≥3 m·s -2 ; CV = 11.1 ± 5.1%) and deceleration running (≤-3 m·s -2 ; CV = 11.9 ± 4.5%) (p &gt; 0.05, ES &lt; 0.2). Defenders had a largely higher overall energy expenditure than midfielders and attackers (p &lt; 0.01, ES &gt; 0.6). Overall energy expenditure and cost were largely to very largely correlated with 5 m speed and 22 m agility sprint time and counter movement jump height (r = -0.70-0.69, p &lt; 0.05). The detected variability indicates that global GPS-derived metabolic power data in elite soccer players from a single preseason match should be preferably used for practical applications. Contrary, high-intensity indicators should be interpreted cautiously and repeated match observations are recommended to establish meaningful high-intensity profiles of the players. Differences among playing positions and relationships with explosive physical abilities indicate that metabolic power analyses can provide new insights into the mechanics and energetics of soccer.","This paper investigates the variability of GPS-derived metabolic power data in elite soccer players during pre-season matches and examines differences across playing positions. It finds that while overall energy expenditure is consistently lower in terms of variability compared to high-intensity metrics, significant correlations exist between metabolic power data and physical attributes like speed and agility, suggesting the need for caution when interpreting high-intensity indicators."
Intratissue percutaneous electolysis combined with active physical therapy for the treatment of adductor longus enthesopathy-related groin pain: a randomized trial,2017-08-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Carlos Moreno, Gabriele Mattiussi, Francisco J.

Does Intensive Soccer Playing During the Growth Period Lead to Leg Length Discrepancies?,2017-08-01,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,Sports Medicine International Open,"Jean-Luc Guer, Sylvain Blanchard, Marta Harnagea, Eric Lopez, Michel Behr","Leg length discrepancies (LLD) are a common reason for podiatry consultations and can affect up to 90% of the overall population. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that intensive participation in certain sports can alter bone development. The aim of this study is to explore any possible relation between playing soccer and the appearance or evolution of LLD, by means of a retrospective study based on the analysis of case reports of patients followed for foot or plantar troubles. Case reports were selected in the archives of a podiatric clinic for the period between 2002 and 2016 among patients who declared regular to intensive soccer playing, aged 13 years or more. LLD was detected in the vast majority of cases (95 cases out of 104). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed and revealed a strong correlation between the laterality of the kicking limb and that of the shorter leg. The shorter limb was on the side of the kicking leg in 96% of the cases when considering the players who began practice before the age of 13, and only 53% of the cases for others. Intensive soccer playing at a young age may encourage the appearance and evolution of a real LLD.","The paper investigates the potential relationship between intensive soccer participation during the growth period and the development of leg length discrepancies (LLD). Findings indicate a strong correlation between the laterality of the kicking limb and the shorter leg, suggesting that young soccer players may be at an increased risk for LLD, particularly if they begin playing before age 13."

Reliable quantification of exposure is key to undertaking informative epidemiological studies of cognitive function or neurodegenerative effects amongst former players and is a prerequisite for the design of appropriate interventions to prevent risk of disease. We propose to identify the potential determinants of exposure of chronic sub-concussive head impacts due to heading a football, and how these might relate to the putative disease processes of interest. Information about frequency and intensity of impacts will be collected retrospectively using interviews with subjects, consultation with a panel of former players, analysis of available records, and archive video of games. Important changes that may have affected exposure over time, such as the weight of balls and the pattern of play, will be identified. We will integrate these data into one or more metrics for energy transfer and/or acceleration from head impacts, based on a biomechanical model of the impact process.","The paper assesses exposure to sub-concussive head impacts in former professional soccer players, focusing on the need for reliable quantification of these impacts to understand potential cognitive effects and inform interventions.

The Role of Neck Muscle Activities on the Risk of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football,2017-07-28,ASME International,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,"Xin Jin, Zhaoying Feng, Valerie Mika, Haiyan Li, David C. Viano, King H. Yang","Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is frequently associated with sports activities. It has generally been accepted that neck strengthening exercises are effective as a preventive strategy for reducing sports-related concussion risks. However, the interpretation of the link between neck strength and concussion risks remains unclear. In this study, a typical helmeted head-to-head impact in American football was simulated using the head and neck complex finite element (FE) model. The impact scenario selected was previously reported in lab-controlled incident reconstructions from high-speed video footages of the National Football League using two head-neck complexes taken from Hybrid III dummies. Four different muscle activation strategies were designed to represent no muscle response, a reactive muscle response, a pre-activation response, and response due to stronger muscle strength. Head kinematics and various head/brain injury risk predictors were selected as response variables to compare the effects of neck muscles on the risk of sustaining the concussion. Simulation results indicated that active responses of neck muscles could effectively reduce the risk of brain injury. Also, anticipatory muscle activation played a dominant role on impact outcomes. Increased neck strength can decrease the time to compress the neck and its effects on reducing brain injury risks need to be further studied.","The paper investigates the relationship between neck muscle activities and the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in American football, specifically examining how different muscle activation strategies during head impacts affect concussion risks. It finds that active neck muscle responses, particularly anticipatory activation, can significantly lower the likelihood of brain injuries during simulated impacts, highlighting the need for further research on neck strength and its protective effects."
Comparison of SCAT-3 Baseline Testing and P300 ERP between Seasons in University Football Players,2017-07-28,"University of Western Ontario, Western Libraries",Western Undergraduate Research Journal: Health and Natural Sciences,Dillon J Richards,"Abstract Contact sport teams require their athletes to undergo baseline concussion testing for comparison to their post-concussion results. The standard test during this study was the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3rd edition (SCAT-3). Clinically used for return to play procedure, most athletes return to baseline scores 8-10 days’ post-concussion. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive means of measuring the electro-physiological function of the brain. EEGs are the summative measure of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) which are measures of brain activity after a specific event. P300 is an example of an ERP that is commonly used as a neurocognitive marker in concussion research. P300 can be further broken down into P3a and P3b, which relate to attention and decision making respectively. Using this technique, lasting functional deficits, beyond those that are highlighted on the SCAT-3 scores, have been noted. This study aims to evaluate the effect subconcussive impacts (SCI) have on SCAT-3 and electrophysiology from one season to the next in Canadian University football players over two seasons. Participants underwent standard SCAT-3 and EEG baseline testing at the beginning of two subsequent seasons. The EEG tests consist of two 5-minute baseline periods with eyes open and closed, followed by a 10-minute session collecting event-related potentials using a three-stimulus Oddball paradigm. Players mean scores showed increases in both number of symptoms (1±4.08) and symptom severity (1.9±6.6). Mean P3a and P3b latencies increased. Additionally, mean amplitudes decreased for both P3a and P3b. University Football players show physiological defects from accumulated SCI during a season. These deficits may accumulate each successive season without resolution. Due to their slow onset, evaluations of these changes are difficult identity. EEG measurements are sensitive to small changes in function and serve as an ideal tool to measure these changes. The SCAT-3 is less sensitive to these minor changes but still has value since it can be used acutely in sideline assessment of concussion.","This study evaluates the impact of subconcussive impacts on concussion assessments in university football players over two seasons, comparing results from the SCAT-3 baseline testing and P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). It highlights that while SCAT-3 scores may show only minor deficits, EEG measurements indicate significant physiological changes, suggesting that accumulated subconcussive impacts can lead to lasting functional deficits in athletes."

Head impact location and severity (linear acceleration [gravity], rotational acceleration [radian per square second], and Head Impact Technology severity profile [unitless]) were captured for 19 379 total head impacts at practices using the Head Impact Telemetry System.Players' faceguards were categorized as either heavier (>480 g) or lighter (≤480 g) using a median split. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for sustaining top of the head impacts between faceguard groups using a random intercepts generalized logit model. We compared head impact severity between groups using random intercepts general linear models (α = 0.05). Player position was included in all models.Overall, the 4 head impact locations were equally distributed across faceguard groups (F(3,26) = 2.16, P = 0.117).

Effects of timing of signal indicating jump directions on knee biomechanics in jump-landing-jump tasks,2017-07-21,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Mitchell L. Stephenson, Taylour J. Hinshaw, Haley A. Wadley, Qin Zhu, Margaret A. Wilson, Mark Byra, Boyi Dai","A variety of the available time to react (ATR) has been utilised to study knee biomechanics during reactive jump-landing tasks. The purpose was to quantify knee kinematics and kinetics during a jump-land-jump task of three possible directions as the ATR was reduced. Thirty-four recreational athletes performed 45 trials of a jump-land-jump task, during which the direction of the second jump (lateral, medial or vertical) was indicated before they initiated the first jump, the instant they initiated the first jump, 300 ms before landing, 150 ms before landing or at the instant of landing. Knee joint angles and moments close to the instant of landing were significantly different when the ATR was equal to or more than 300 ms before landing, but became similar when the ATR was 150 ms or 0 ms before landing. As the ATR was decreased, knee moments decreased for the medial jump direction, but increased for the lateral jump direction. When the ATR is shorter than an individual's reaction time, the movement pattern cannot be pre-planned before landing. Knee biomechanics are dependent on the timing of the signal and the subsequent jump direction. Precise control of timing and screening athletes with low ATR are suggested.","This paper examines the influence of the timing of a signal indicating jump direction on knee biomechanics during jump-landing-jump tasks.

Comparison of jump-landing protocols with Biodex Balance System as measures of dynamic postural stability in athletes,2017-07-21,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,Zarko Krkeljas,"The objective of the study was to determine whether a relationship exists between the two common methods for assessing postural stability in athletes: the time-to-stabilisation (TTS) via force-plate and the Biodex Balance System (BBS). The conditions under which these measurements assess dynamic postural control may not provide sufficient feedback to practitioners. Fourty-four amateur soccer players with no history of musculoskeletal disorders volunteered for the study. Pearson correlation was used to compare the anterior–posterior (AP), medio-lateral (ML), and the overall stability indexes measured by BBS, with the corresponding parameters of TTS assessed via force plate. There was no significant correlation between any parameters of dynamic stability measured by force-plate and the stability indexes. However, there was a significant correlation between the resulting vectors and the AP component of TTS for each jump protocol. Furthermore, forward drop landing exhibited shortest TTS in AP direction, while lateral drop landing resulted in longer ML TTS relative to both forward jumps (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that the TTS and BBS stability indexes should be used as distinct measures of dynamic postural stability. TTS protocols may be modified to target a specific training conditions or athletic population.","This study examines the relationship between two methods of assessing dynamic postural stability in athletes—time-to-stabilization (TTS) via force-plate and the Biodex Balance System (BBS).

In this paper we aim to learn a variety of environment-aware locomotion skills with a limited amount of prior knowledge. We adopt a two-level hierarchical control framework. First, low-level controllers are learned that operate at a fine timescale and which achieve robust walking gaits that satisfy stepping-target and style objectives. Second, high-level controllers are then learned which plan at the timescale of steps by invoking desired step targets for the low-level controller. The high-level controller makes decisions directly based on high-dimensional inputs, including terrain maps or other suitable representations of the surroundings. Both levels of the control policy are trained using deep reinforcement learning. Results are demonstrated on a simulated 3D biped. Low-level controllers are learned for a variety of motion styles and demonstrate robustness with respect to force-based disturbances, terrain variations, and style interpolation. High-level controllers are demonstrated that are capable of following trails through terrains, dribbling a soccer ball towards a target location, and navigating through static or dynamic obstacles.","The paper ""DeepLoco"" explores the development of environment-aware locomotion skills using a hierarchical control framework that integrates low-level and high-level controllers.

The effects of ankle protectors on lower limb kinematics in male football players: a comparison to braced and unbraced ankles,2017-07-20,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Comparative Exercise Physiology,"R. Graydon, D. Fewtrell, S. Atkins, J. Sinclair","Football (soccer) players have a high risk of injuring the lower extremities. To reduce the risk of ankle inversion injuries ankle braces can be worn. To reduce the risk of ankle contusion injuries ankle protectors can be utilised. However, athletes can only wear one of these devices at a time. The effects of ankle braces on stance limb kinematics has been extensively researched, however ankle protectors have had little attention. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of ankle protectors on lower extremity kinematics during the stance phase of jogging and compare them with braced and uncovered ankles. Twelve male participants ran at 3.4 m/s in three test conditions; ankle braces (BRACE), ankle protectors (PROTECTOR) and with uncovered ankles (WITHOUT). Stance phase kinematics were collected using an eight-camera motion capture system. Kinematic data between conditions were analysed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. The results showed that BRACE (absolute range of motion (ROM) = 10.72° and relative ROM = 10.26°) significantly ( P &lt;0.05) restricted the ankle in the coronal plane when compared to PROTECTOR (absolute ROM=13.44° and relative ROM =12.82°) and WITHOUT (absolute ROM=13.64° and relative ROM=13.10°). It was also found that both BRACE (peak dorsiflexion=17.02° and absolute ROM=38.34°) and PROTECTOR (peak dorsiflexion =18.46° and absolute ROM =40.15°) significantly ( P &lt;0.05) reduced sagittal plane motion when compared to WITHOUT (peak dorsiflexion =19.20° and absolute ROM =42.66°). Ankle protectors’ effects on lower limb kinematics closely resemble that of an unbraced ankle. Therefore, ankle protectors should only be used as a means to reduce risk of ankle contusion injuries and not implemented as a method to reduce the risk of ankle inversion injuries. Furthermore, the reductions found in sagittal plane motion of the ankle could possibly increase the bodies energy demand needed for locomotion when ankle protectors are utilised.","This paper investigates the effects of ankle protectors on lower limb kinematics in male football players, comparing their influence to that of ankle braces and uncovered ankles during jogging. The study finds that ankle protectors allow for a greater range of motion than braces but restrict sagittal plane motion similarly, suggesting they are more suitable for preventing contusion injuries rather than inversion injuries."

J Strength Cond Res 31(11): 3034-3045, 2017-Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programs are less successful in basketball than soccer and may be due to distinct movement strategies that these athletes develop from sport-specific training. The purpose of this study was to identify biomechanical differences between female basketball and soccer players during multidirectional jump landings. Lower extremity biomechanics of 89 female athletes who played competitive basketball (n = 40) or soccer (n = 49) at the middle- or high-school level were analyzed with 3-dimensional motion analysis during a drop vertical jump, double- (SAG-DL) and single-leg forward jump (SAG-SL), and double- (FRONT-DL) and single-leg (FRONT-SL) lateral jump. Basketball players landed with either less hip or knee, or both hip and knee excursion during all tasks (p ≤ 0.05) except for the SAGSL task, basketball players landed with greater peak hip flexion angles (p = 0.04). The FRONT-SL task elicited the most distinct sport-specific differences, including decreased hip adduction (p < 0.001) angles, increased hip internal rotation (p = 0.003), and increased relative knee external rotation (p = 0.001) excursions in basketball players. In addition, the FRONT-SL task elicited greater forces in knee abduction (p = 0.003) and lesser forces in hip adduction (p = 0.001) and knee external rotation (p < 0.001) in basketball players. Joint energetics were different during the FRONT-DL task, as basketball players exhibited less sagittal plane energy absorption at the hip (p < 0.001) and greater hip (p < 0.001) and knee (p = 0.001) joint stiffness. Sport-specific movement strategies were identified during all jump landing tasks, such that soccer players exhibited a more protective landing strategy than basketball players, justifying future efforts toward sport-specific ACL injury prevention programs.","This study investigates the biomechanical differences in multidirectional jump landings between female basketball and soccer players, highlighting the potential implications for ACL injury prevention strategies.

Muaidi","Context : The effect of acute static stretching (ASS) on the lower limb reaction time (RT) has been recently questioned to decrease the risk of falling and injuries in situations requiring a rapid reaction, as in the cases of balance disturbance. Objective : The main purpose of this study was to detect the effect of ASS on the lower limb RT using a virtual reality device. Design : Two-group control group design. Setting : Research laboratory. Participants : The control and experimental groups were formed randomly from 60 female university students. Intervention : Each participant in the experimental group was tested before and after ASS for the quadriceps, hamstrings, and planter flexor muscles, and compared with the control group with warming-up exercise alone. The stretching program involved warming up in the form of circular running inside the lab for 5 minutes followed by stretching of each muscle group three times, to the limit of discomfort of 45 seconds, with resting period of 15 seconds between stretches. Main Outcome Measures : The measurements included the RT of the dominant lower-extremity using the dynamic stability program STABL Virtual Reality System (model no. DIZ 2709; Motekforce Link). Results : There was a statistically significant reduction ( F = 162, P &lt; .05) in posttest RT between the 2 groups and significant decrease in RT after stretching in the experimental group (7.5%; P &lt; .05). Conclusion : ASS of the lower limb muscles tends to decrease the lower limb RT and improve movement performance.","The paper investigates the effect of acute static stretching (ASS) on lower limb reaction time (RT) using a virtual reality system.

Finally, the selected structural parameters explained 77.9%, 59.8% and 54.3% of variance in rotational traction, vertical deformation and force reduction, respectively. These results show the importance of the selection of the structural components in the design of artificial turf football pitches.","The paper investigates how structural components of third-generation artificial turf football pitches affect their mechanical properties. It finds that factors such as pile length, stabilising bulk density, tuft density, and sub-base material significantly influence rotational traction, vertical deformation, and force reduction, with the structural parameters explaining a substantial portion of the variance in these properties."
Prone Hip Extension Muscle Recruitment is Associated with Hamstring Injury Risk in Amateur Soccer,2017-07-13,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Joke Schuermans, Damien Van Tiggelen, Erik Witvrouw","Abstract ‘Core stability’ is considered essential in rehabilitation and prevention. Particularly with respect to hamstring injury prevention, assessment and training of lumbo-pelvic control is thought to be key. However, supporting scientific evidence is lacking. To explore the importance of proximal neuromuscular function with regard to hamstring injury susceptibility, this study investigated the association between the Prone Hip Extension (PHE) muscle activation pattern and hamstring injury incidence in amateur soccer players. 60 healthy male soccer players underwent a comprehensive clinical examination, comprising a range of motion assessments and the investigation of the posterior chain muscle activation pattern during PHE. Subsequently, hamstring injury incidence was recorded prospectively throughout a 1.5-season monitoring period. Players who were injured presented a PHE activation pattern that differed significantly from those who did not. Contrary to the controls, hamstring activity onset was significantly delayed (p=0.018), resulting in a shifted activation sequence. Players were 8 times more likely to get injured if the hamstring muscles were activated after the lumbar erector spinae instead of vice versa (p=0.009). Assessment of muscle recruitment during PHE demonstrated to be useful in injury prediction, suggesting that neuromuscular coordination in the posterior chain influences hamstring injury vulnerability.","This study investigates the relationship between Prone Hip Extension (PHE) muscle recruitment patterns and the risk of hamstring injuries in amateur soccer players. The findings reveal that players with delayed hamstring activation in relation to lumbar erector spinae are significantly more likely to sustain injuries, highlighting the importance of proximal neuromuscular function in injury prevention."
Fear of movement in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,2017-07-10,SAGE Publications,Physiotherapy Practice and Research,"Amanda M. Clifford, Eoghan Buckley, Dermot O’Farrell, Quinnette Louw, Colum Moloney","BACKGROUND: Kinesiophobia, fear of physical movement, is the most common reason for not returning to sport after ACLR. Psychological factors influence recovery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Those who undergo ACLR display elevated pain levels as a barrier limiting ret urn to pre-surgical levels of sports performance. To date no study investigating this link has been conducted in an Irish population PURPOSE: To identify individuals who have elevated levels of kinesiophobia after ACLR surgery and ascertain if kinesiophobia was a barrier to return to sport. METHODS: Adults who underwent ACLR in University Hospital during a three year period were eligible to participate. Individuals who had a previous history of ACL rupture and with concomitant injuries were excluded. The 179 eligible individuals were posted the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) a demographic questionnaire and information leaflet to invite them to participate in the study. RESULTS: Forty-five participants that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The majority of the respondents (78.4%) reported high levels of kinesiophobia. Many (73.7%) returned to sports participation, however only 42.1% and 47.2% returned to pre-injury sports participation and performance respectively. Subjectively kinesiophobia was a key barrier limiting return to pre-injury level of sports participation and performance. CONCLUSIONS: Kinesiophobia appears to be a key barrier preventing return to pre-injury level of sports participation and performance after ACLR.","The paper investigates the phenomenon of kinesiophobia, or fear of movement, in patients who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and its impact on returning to sports.

Evaluation and management of sport-related concussions in adolescent athletes,2017-07-01,AME Publishing Company,Translational Pediatrics,"Dilip R. Patel, Venu Parachuri, Amrith Shettigar","Abstract: Sport-related concussions in young athletes are common, generally under reported and often go unrecognized. Concussion in sport may result either from a direct impact to the head or from indirect forces transmitted to the brain from impact elsewhere on the body. Concussions may also result from sudden acceleration, deceleration or rotational forces to the brain. The key features of concussion include confusion, impaired memory and reduced speed of information processing. Recovery may occur from a few days to several weeks or months. Both physical and cognitive rests are recommended for recovery. Long-term cognitive and behavioral complications are a concern. Preventive strategies include education, modification of sport rules, use of equipment such as headgears, face masks and mouth guards, and neck muscle training. Evidence is limited to support effectiveness of these preventive measures with the exception of rule modification in some sports. Laws have been enacted that require medical evaluation and clearance prior to return to play; however, evidence thus far does not show that laws have been effective in reducing the incidence of concussions in sport. More research is needed in all areas of preventive measures. Sports participation is a complex personal decision on the part of adolescent and his or her family. They should be provided with all information on inherent risks so that they can make an informed decision.","The paper evaluates the prevalence and management of sport-related concussions in adolescent athletes, highlighting that these injuries are often underreported and can result from direct impacts or indirect forces. It emphasizes the importance of recovery strategies, preventive measures, and the need for more research, particularly regarding the effectiveness of existing laws and guidelines surrounding concussions in sports."
Exploring the biomechanical load of a sliding on the skin: understanding the acute skin injury mechanism of player-surface interaction,2017-07-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Wilbert van den Eijnde, Kenneth Meijer, Edwin Lamers, Malou Peppelman, Piet van Erp","Currently, there is a shortage of biomechanical data regarding acute skin injury mechanisms that are involved in player-surface contact in soccer on artificial turf. It is hypothesized that peak loads on the skin during the landing phase are an important factor in causing an acute skin injury.Simultaneously, video analysis and load measurements using an in-ground force plate of the landing phase of a sliding tackle were recorded and correlated with observed clinical skin lesions.Video analysis revealed two sliding techniques: a horizontal jump and a sliding-in technique. The first technique resulted in both significantly higher vertical and horizontal peak forces during impact on the knee (2.3±0.4 kN and 1.4±0.5 kN) and thigh (4.9±0.9 kN and 1.8±0.5 kN). In combination with the observed skin lesion areas, a combined normal-shear stress of at least 24 and 14 N.cm-2 induce abrasion injuries on dry artificial turf.The findings of this study confirm that high peak stresses during the landing phase of a sliding is critical for inducing skin injuries on the knee and thigh. Reducing these peak shear stresses could be an important first step towards preventive measures.","The paper investigates the biomechanical loads associated with sliding tackles in soccer and their role in causing acute skin injuries on artificial turf.

Effects of different re-warm up activities in football players' performance,2017-06-29,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Eduardo Abade, Jaime Sampaio, Bruno Gonçalves, Jorge Baptista, Alberto Alves, João Viana","Warm up routines are commonly used to optimize football performance and prevent injuries. Yet, official pre-match protocols may require players to passively rest for approximately 10 to 15 minutes between the warm up and the beginning of the match. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effect of different re-warm up activities on the physical performance of football players. Twenty-Two Portuguese elite under-19 football players participated in the study conducted during the competitive season. Different re-warm up protocols were performed 6 minutes after the same standardized warm up in 4 consecutive days in a crossover controlled approach: without, eccentric, plyometric and repeated changes of direction. Vertical jump and Sprint performances were tested immediately after warm up and 12 minutes after warm up. Results showed that repeated changes of direction and plyometrics presented beneficial effects to jump and sprint. Different practical implications may be taken from the eccentric protocol since a vertical jump impairment was observed, suggesting a possibly harmful effect. The absence of re-warm up activities may be detrimental to players’ physical performance. However, the inclusion of re-warm up prior to match is a complex issue, since the manipulation of volume, intensity and recovery may positively or negatively affect the subsequent performance. In fact, this exploratory study shows that eccentric exercise may be harmful for physical performance when performed prior a football match. However, plyometric and repeated changes of direction exercises seem to be simple, quick and efficient activities to attenuate losses in vertical jump and sprint capacity after warm up. Coaches should aim to develop individual optimal exercise modes in order to optimize physical performance after re warm activities.","This study investigates the impact of different re-warm up protocols on the performance of elite under-19 football players. It finds that while plyometric and repeated changes of direction activities enhance vertical jump and sprint performance, eccentric exercises can be detrimental, indicating the need for tailored warm-up strategies to optimize player readiness."

A review of field-based assessments of neuromuscular control and their utility in male youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 283-299, 2019-Lower-extremity injuries in male youth soccer are common and equate to a substantial time loss from training and competitions during the course of a season. Extended periods of absence will impact player involvement in skill and physical development activities, as well as participation in competitive match play. Neuromuscular risk factors for lower-extremity injury in male youth soccer players can be categorized into quadriceps dominance, leg dominance, ligament dominance, trunk dominance, and reduced dynamic stability. Valid screening methods to identify risk factors that are practically viable are needed for youth athletes who may be at a greater risk of injury in soccer. Although field-based tests of neuromuscular control provide a reliable option for the assessment of injury risk in adults and females, less data are available in male youth soccer players, and further research is required to examine their ability to predict injury risk. This article provides a review of the current literature pertaining to field-based screening tests and critically appraises their suitability for use with male youth soccer players. Currently, the only method that has been validated in male youth soccer players is the landing error scoring system. Asymmetrical anterior reach measured during the Y-Balance test may also be considered because of its strong predictive ability in male youth basketball players; however, further research is required to fully support its use with soccer players.","This paper reviews field-based assessments of neuromuscular control specifically in male youth soccer players, addressing the common issue of lower-extremity injuries and their implications for training and competition.

The effect of high intensity exercise and anticipation on trunk and lower limb biomechanics during a crossover cutting manoeuvre,2017-06-26,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Enda F. Whyte, Chris Richter, Siobhan O’connor, Kieran A. Moran","We investigated the effects of high intensity, intermittent exercise (HIIP) and anticipation on trunk, pelvic and lower limb biomechanics during a crossover cutting manoeuvre. Twenty-eight male, varsity athletes performed crossover cutting manoeuvres in anticipated and unanticipated conditions pre- and post-HIIP. Kinematic and kinetic variables were captured using a motion analysis system. Statistical parametric mapping (repeated-measures ANOVA) was used to identify differences in biomechanical patterns. Results demonstrated that both unanticipation and fatigue (HIIP) altered the biomechanics of the crossover cutting manoeuvre, whereas no interactions effects were observed. Unanticipation resulted in less trunk and pelvic side flexion in the direction of cut (d = 0.70 – 0.79). This led to increased hip abductor and external rotator moments and increased knee extensor and valgus moments with small effects (d = 0.24–0.42), potentially increasing ACL strain. The HIIP resulted in trivial to small effects only with a decrease in internal knee rotator and extensor moment and decreased knee power absorption (d = 0.35), reducing potential ACL strain. The effect of trunk and hip control exercises in unanticipated conditions on the crossover cutting manoeuvre should be investigated with a view to refining ACL injury prevention programmes.","This paper investigates the impact of high-intensity intermittent exercise and anticipation on trunk, pelvic, and lower limb biomechanics during crossover cutting manoeuvres in athletes.

Kerr, Lauren A. Pierpoint, Dustin W. Currie, Erin B. Wasserman, R. Dawn Comstock","Few studies compare sports injury patterns in different settings. This study described the epidemiology of soccer injuries presenting to emergency departments (EDs) and compared injuries presenting to EDs to injuries presenting to collegiate and high school athletic trainers (ATs). Soccer-related injuries (product code 1267) in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) that were sustained by individuals at least two years of age in 2004-2013 were included. High School Reporting Information Online (HS RIO) data for high school soccer injuries during the 2005/06-2013/14 academic years were compared to NEISS data for those aged 14-17 years in 2005-2013. National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) data for collegiate soccer injuries during the 2009/10-2013/14 academic years were compared to NEISS data for those aged 18-22 years in 2009-2013. All datasets included weights to calculate national estimates. Injury proportion ratios (IPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) compared nationally estimated injury distributions between the HS RIO/NCAA-ISP and NEISS data subsets. During the study period, 63,258 soccer-related injuries were captured by NEISS, which translates to an estimated 2,039,250 injuries seen at US EDs nationwide. Commonly injured body parts included the head/face (19.1%), ankle (17.6%), hand/wrist (15.3%), and knee (12.2%). Common diagnoses included sprains/strains (34.0%), fractures (22.2%), and contusions (17.7%). Compared to their respective age ranges in NEISS, sprains/strains comprised a larger proportion of injuries in HS RIO (48.3% vs. 33.7%; IPR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.42) and NCAA-ISP (51.3% vs. 37.0%; IPR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.46). In contrast, fractures comprised a smaller proportion of injuries in HS RIO than in NEISS (7.5% vs. 18.6%; IPR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.47) and NCAA-ISP (2.8% vs. 15.7%; IPR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.22). ATs more commonly reported injuries that are easily diagnosed and treated (e.g., sprains/strains); EDs more commonly reported injuries with longer recovery times and rehabilitation (e.g., fractures). Although ED surveillance data can identify the most severe sports-related injuries, high school and college sports surveillance may better describe the breadth of sports-related injuries. Our findings may provide further support for school-based sports medicine professionals, but further research is needed to comprehensively examine the potential economic and health-related benefits.","This paper examines the epidemiology of soccer-related injuries by comparing data from emergency departments (EDs) to injuries reported by high school and collegiate athletic trainers.

Dynamic knee valgus alignment influences impact attenuation in the lower extremity during the deceleration phase of a single-leg landing,2017-06-20,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Akihiro Tamura, Kiyokazu Akasaka, Takahiro Otsudo, Jyunya Shiozawa, Yuka Toda, Kaori Yamada","Dynamic knee valgus during landings is associated with an increased risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. In addition, the impact on the body during landings must be attenuated in the lower extremity joints. The purpose of this study was to investigate landing biomechanics during landing with dynamic knee valgus by measuring the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and angular impulses in the lower extremity during a single-leg landing. The study included 34 female college students, who performed the single-leg drop vertical jump. Lower extremity kinetic and kinematic data were obtained from a 3D motion analysis system. Participants were divided into valgus (N = 19) and varus (N = 15) groups according to the knee angular displacement during landings. The vGRF and angular impulses of the hip, knee, and ankle were calculated by integrating the vGRF-time curve and each joint's moment-time curve. vGRF impulses did not differ between two groups. Hip angular impulse in the valgus group was significantly smaller than that in the varus group (0.019 ± 0.033 vs. 0.067 ± 0.029 Nms/kgm, p<0.01), whereas knee angular impulse was significantly greater (0.093 ± 0.032 vs. 0.045 ± 0.040 Nms/kgm, p<0.01). There was no difference in ankle angular impulse between the groups. Our results indicate that dynamic knee valgus increases the impact the knee joint needs to attenuate during landing; conversely, the knee varus participants were able to absorb more of the landing impact with the hip joint.","The paper investigates the influence of dynamic knee valgus alignment on lower extremity impact attenuation during single-leg landings, highlighting increased risk for ACL injury.

As such, the objective of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive summary of current movement assessment tools and appraise the evidence supporting their development. A systematic literature search was performed using PRISMA guidelines to identify multicomponent movement assessment tools. Commonalities between tools and the evidence provided to support the content of each tool was identified. Each tool underwent critical appraisal to identify the rigor in which it was developed, and its applicability to professional practice.

CORR Insights®: Does the FIFA 11+ Injury Prevention Program Reduce the Incidence of ACL Injury in Male Soccer Players?,2017-06-14,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Orthopaedics &amp; Related Research,Albert O. Gee,"Where Are We Now? Despite considerable research into almost every facet of the ligament's biology, ACL tears continue to plague athletes of all ages. The risk of tearing an ACL is multifactorial and includes anatomical, hormonal, biomechanical, and neuromuscular factors [4]. Women are four to six times more likely to injure their ACLs than are men [4]. Approximately 70% of ACL injuries are noncontact, suggesting that there is a biomechanical and/or neuromuscular deficit that may contribute to ACL tears, especially in women [4]. Surgical reconstruction can restore knee stability, but patients remain at risk for reinjury [2]. Considerable interest and research has sought to identify these deficits and use exercise training programs to correct, or possibly prevent, ACL tears [6]. In their study, Silvers-Granelli and colleagues performed a cluster-randomized control trial to determine the efficacy of one such prevention training program, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) 11+. The FIFA 11+ is an easy-to-implement, straightforward exercise program that can be performed as an on-field warm-up before practice or games without much equipment. Their analysis showed a 77% decrease in the overall incidence rate of ACL injuries in the group that used the FIFA 11+ program compared to the control group. While previous ACL-tear prevention studies have predominantly targeted women athletes because of their higher risk of ACL injury [6], the current study included only men, confirming that these training programs can have similar impact on both men and women. Where Do We Need To Go? In a recent motion-analysis lab study testing the FIFA 11+ [7], preadolescent athletes demonstrated some (but not complete) improvement in peak valgus moments and other biomechanical factors associated with the risk of ACL injury after implementation of the program—suggesting that there is room to improve and still much to learn about how these prevention programs exert their protective effects. Strategies for implementing prevention programs need to be planned or augmented at all levels and ages, and identifying the best implementation personnel will be important. Coaches may be the best instigators of implementation [3]. In fact, Switzerland successfully implemented a country-wide FIFA 11+ program for their amateur soccer leagues through a large-scale coaching education campaign [3]. Additionally, a randomized control study of FIFA 11+ implementation strategies identified preseason coaching workshops to be an effective method for implementation and adherence to the program [1, 5]. A better understanding of the gaps in knowledge regarding prevention programs is needed. For example, the role of the sports medicine surgeon and nonoperative sports providers in increasing participation in these types of programs is not well-defined. Often, surgeons are not on the front lines of prevention strategies, as their first encounter with the athlete is after an ACL injury. Yet, these specialists are relied upon by patients, parents, coaches, and athletic trainers for valuable input at all points in the process. The facilitators and barriers to greater implementation of ACL injury prevention programs need to be further studied. Increased marketing to athletes and parents, as well as further education across the board for physicians, therapists, and trainers could potentially increase athlete participation and adherence to ACL injury prevention programs. As broader implementation and acceptance is sought, we, as a sports medicine community (physicians, therapists, trainers), must decide which program to use and whether a consensus can be forged around a single prevention program. The existence of numerous programs may be a barrier to implementation, while a single program would help streamline its delivery to players and coaches while facilitating consistency of future research. How Do We Get There? A recent meta-regression study [6] identified the common elements from all previous ACL injury prevention programs. The study identified age, dosage of training, variations within training, and verbal feedback as the most substantial factors for a program's success. Based on this, prevention programs should target young athletes, ensure compliance and adherence to training regimens (what was referred to as “dosage of training”), practice regimens that use a variety of exercises (balance, strength, plyometrics), and provide some degree of coaching or instruction (verbal feedback). These may be helpful foundations on which to begin building consensus on best prevention programs and which athletes to target to deliver maximum benefit. Population-based studies examining the effects of marketing campaigns, education programs, and who to best target (athlete, parent, coaches, physicians) will help to identify where to invest resources. Once successful models of implementation strategies are elucidated, the required resources and costs will be better understood and the cost-effectiveness analysis of these ACL injury prevention programs can be determined from the reduction rates of ACL tears compared to the individual and societal costs of ACL injury and treatment. Coaches and athletic program administrators will demand this information to determine if prevention methods are worth the investment. Although the current study did not report on cost, the authors stressed the importance of cost-effectiveness data and recommended further study.","This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program in reducing ACL injuries among male soccer players. The study found a significant 77% reduction in ACL injury incidence using this program, while highlighting the necessity for improved implementation strategies and education to increase participation in such preventive measures across various levels of athletics."
Effects of a dynamic core stability program on the biomechanics of cutting maneuvers: A randomized controlled trial,2017-06-12,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"E. F. Whyte, C. Richter, S. O'Connor, K. A. Moran","Deficits in trunk control predict ACL injuries which frequently occur during high‐risk activities such as cutting.

Thirty‐one male, varsity footballers participated in this randomized controlled trial. Three‐dimensional trunk and lower limb biomechanics were captured in a motion analysis laboratory during the weight acceptance phase of anticipated and unanticipated side and crossover cutting maneuvers at baseline and 6‐week follow‐up. The DCS group performed a DCS program three times weekly for 6 weeks in a university rehabilitation room. Both the DCS and control groups concurrently completed their regular practice and match play. Statistical parametric mapping and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to determine any group ( DCS vs control) by time (pre vs post) interactions. The DCS resulted in greater internal hip extensor ( P =.017, η 2 =0.079), smaller internal knee valgus ( P =.026, η 2 =0.076), and smaller internal knee external rotator moments ( P =.041, η 2 =0.066) during anticipated side cutting compared with the control group. It also led to reduced posterior ground reaction forces for all cutting activities ( P =.015‐.030, η 2 =0.074‐0.105). A 6‐week DCS program did not affect trunk kinematics, but it did reduce a small number of biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury, predominantly during anticipated side cutting. A DCS program could play a role in multimodal ACL injury prevention programs.","This paper investigates the impact of a 6-week dynamic core stability program on the biomechanics of cutting maneuvers in male varsity footballers, highlighting the link between trunk control and ACL injury risk.

Phase space reconstruction is needed to unfold hidden facets of a golfer's behaviour. Results indicate that golfers' performances do not approach a stable state, but seem rather unpredictable. A soccer match can also be treated as a complex system. Some components – the players – and their respective behaviour represented by movement trajectories are known and can be used to describe the system's behaviour. We propose that no embedding is needed for the RP construction in this case. Results indicate that the more goal shots there are in a game, the more unstructured it is. Furthermore, if several golfers or soccer matches are investigated, we recommend using the same RP parameters to achieve comparable results.","The paper examines the application of recurrence analysis to model game sports, specifically golf and soccer, as complex systems. It highlights the unpredictability of golfer performance and the relationship between the number of goal shots and the structural complexity of soccer matches, advocating for consistent RP parameters for comparative analysis."
Brain Network Activation Technology Does Not Assist with Concussion Diagnosis and Return to Play in Football Athletes,2017-06-06,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Neurology,"Steven P. Broglio, Richelle Williams, Andrew Lapointe, Ashley Rettmann, Brandon Moore, Sean K. Meehan, James T. Eckner","Background: Concussion diagnosis and management remains a largely subjective process. This investigation sought to evaluate the utility of a novel neuroelectric measure for concussion diagnosis and return to play decision making. Hypothesis: Brain Network Activation (BNA) scores obtained within 72-hours of injury will be lower than the athlete's preseason evaluation and that of a matched control athlete; and the BNA will demonstrate on-going declines at the return to play and post-season time points, while standard measures will have returned to pre-injury and control athlete levels. Design: case-control study Methods: Football athletes with a diagnosed concussion (n=8) and matched control football athletes (n=8) completed a preseason evaluation of cognitive (i.e., Cogstate Computerized Cognitive Assessment Tool) and neuroelectric function (i.e., BNA), clinical reaction time, SCAT3 self-reported symptoms and quality of life (i.e., Health Behavior Inventory and Satisfaction with Life Scale). Following a diagnosed concussion, injured and control athletes completed post-injury evaluations within 72-hours, once asymptomatic, and at the conclusion of the football season. Results: Case analysis of the neuroelectric assessment failed to provide improved diagnostics beyond traditional clinical measures. Statistical analyses indicated significant BNA improvements in the concussed and control groups from baseline to the asymptomatic timepoint. Conclusions: With additional attention being placed on rapid and accurate concussion diagnostics and return to play decision making, the addition of a novel neuroelectric assessment does not appear to provide additional clinical benefit at this time. Clinicians should continue to follow the recommendations for the clinical management of concussion with the assessment of the symptom, cognitive, and motor control domains.","The paper evaluates the effectiveness of Brain Network Activation (BNA) technology in diagnosing concussions and determining return-to-play decisions for football athletes. It finds that BNA scores do not offer superior diagnostic benefits compared to traditional methods, suggesting that clinicians should rely on established concussion management protocols instead."
The Effect of a Simulated Soccer Match on Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk Factors,2017-06-02,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Matthew Wright, Paul Chesterton, Mark Wijnbergen, Adrian O’Rourke, Tom Macpherson","Abstract To investigate the effect of within match fatigue on knee kinematics and jump kinetics in girls’ soccer players, a quasi-experiment time series design was employed collecting data before, after and at 15-min intervals during a 90-min simulated soccer match. 15 girl players (age 13.1±1.4 years) performed a counter movement jump and a single-leg drop jump. Mean concentric force and flight time to contraction time ratio were derived from the counter movement jump. Knee valgus and flexion angles were calculated during the single-leg drop from 3-dimensional motion capture. Subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and readiness were collected at each time series. Small to large increases in RPE and reductions in readiness were observed throughout the match from baseline. Moderate to large improvements in mean concentric force were shown at 15, 75 and 90-min when compared to baseline. Flight time to contraction time ratio increased moderately at 15 min. Changes in kinematics were typically trivial or unclear however, small increases in knee valgus were shown after 30 min compared to baseline. Subjective measures may provide useful information to understand the physical response of young players to match play.","This paper investigates the impact of fatigue during a simulated soccer match on knee kinematics and jump kinetics in young female soccer players. Key findings include a moderate increase in mean concentric force over time, small increases in knee valgus after 30 minutes, and a correlation between perceived exertion and reduced readiness levels throughout the match."
Change of direction ability in young elite soccer players: determining factors vary with angle variation,2017-06-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Mehdi Rouissi, Moktar Chtara, Adam Owen, Angus Burnett, Karim Chamari","The ability to change direction is considered of paramount importance in team sports. Currently there is a lack of consensus regarding the most important physical factors that determine change of direction (COD) ability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between COD ability and targeted selected physical attributes of sprinting, isometric strength and explosive power.Thirty-one young elite soccer players (mean±SD, age =17.4±0.6 years, height =177±0.5 cm; leg length =96.9±3.3 cm, body-mass =69.0±6.2 kg) were recruited. A total of eight COD tasks consisting of; a 5-m sprint then a COD of 45°, 90°, 135° or 180° followed by another 5m sprint were performed using dominant (DL) and non-dominant legs (NDL). Physical tests including a 10-m Straight-Line Sprint Test, 12 lower limb isometric strength tests, and jumping tests including: 1) five alternate Leg Jump Test; 2) triple hop distance (DL and NDL); and 3) Standing Broad Jump Test were performed.Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the physical attributes explained between 30% and 74% of the variance of the COD performance. Furthermore, these physical attributes were dependent upon COD angle and direction.The affecting variables of the COD performance differ according to the angle of COD and the leg used to turn. Moreover, isometric strength of the lower-limb muscles represented a major determinant factor of the COD-ability. Consequently, physical fitness coaches should include isometric muscle strengthening exercises in addition to traditional dynamic muscle strength exercises. Moreover, they should implement specific lower limb strength exercises depending on players' deficit in each COD's angles.","This study investigates the factors influencing change of direction (COD) ability in young elite soccer players, emphasizing the role of physical attributes such as sprinting speed, isometric strength, and explosive power. The findings indicate that the determinants of COD performance vary significantly with the direction and angle of the turn, highlighting the importance of tailored isometric strength training for athletes."
Peak torque and muscle balance in the knees of young U-15 and U-17 soccer athletes playing various tactical positions,2017-06-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Cleiton Chiamonti Bona, Hugo Tourinho Filho, Mikel Izquierdo, Ricardo M. Pires Ferraz, Mário C. Marques","Soccer is a sport that is practiced worldwide and has been investigated in its various aspects, particularly muscle strength, which is an essential motor skill for sports performance. The objective of this study was to investigate the peak torque and muscle balance on the knee extensor and flexor of young soccer players in the tactical positions of goalkeeper, defender, full back, midfielder, defensive midfielder and striker, as well as to determine which field position has the highest peak torque.Forty-nine male players were recruited and divided into two categories during the preparatory period of the season: the Under-15 (U-15) group (N.=23, mean age 14.7±0.5 years, body mass 58.2±10.5 kg, body height 168.5±7.6 cm), and the Under-17 (U-17) group (N.=26, mean age 16.8±0.4 years, body mass 69.2±7.9 kg, body height 176.2±6.6 cm).The U-17 athletes presented a higher peak torque in all the movements of flexion and extension in the two angular velocities (i.e. 60°/s and 300°/s), but only the dominant knee extensor at 300°/s was significantly different between the two categories as well as the percentage change in peak torque compared between U-15 and U-17 was always above 20%. The peak torque variation in the U-17 category (i.e. mostly above 20%) highlights a higher peak torque compared to U-15 athletes.The muscular deficit of the two categories presented a low average of 10-15%, indicating a good muscle balance between knee extensors and flexors. Finally, goalkeepers and defenders achieved the highest peak torque amongst the field positions.","This study investigates peak torque and muscle balance in the knee extensor and flexor muscle groups of young soccer players (U-15 and U-17) across various tactical positions. The findings indicate that U-17 athletes exhibit higher peak torque, especially in knee extension at fast angular velocities, with goalkeepers and defenders showing the highest values among positions, while both age groups maintain a good muscle balance."
A Pilot Study of the Effect of Outsole Hardness on Lower Limb Kinematics and Kinetics during Soccer Related Movements,2017-06-01,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Dong Sun, Qichang Mei, Julien S Baker, Xuewen Jia, Yaodong Gu","Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different outsole hardness of turf cleats shoes on the lower limb kinematics and kinetics of soccer players playing on artificial turf. The participants were required to complete tasks of straight running and 45° left sidestep cutting movements, respectively, at the speed of 4.5 ± 0.2 m/s on artificial turf. They were asked to randomly select turf cleats shoes with a soft outsole (SO), medium hardness outsole (MO) and hard outsole (HO). During the stance phase of straight running, peak pressure and force-time integral in medial forefoot (MFF) of players wearing cleats shoes with MO were significantly higher than those wearing cleats shoes with SO. During the stance phase of a 45° cutting maneuver, players wearing cleats shoes with SO showed significantly higher peak knee flexion and abduction angles than the HO group. Players wearing cleats shoes with SO also showed higher ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles compared with those wearing cleats shoes with HO. The vertical average loading rate (VALR) as well as peak pressure and force-time integral in the heel (H) and lateral forefoot (LFF) regions of players wearing cleats shoes with HO were significantly higher than those wearing shoes with SO. On the contrary, peak pressure and force-time integral of players wearing shoes with SO were significantly higher than those wearing shoes with HO in MFF. A higher vertical loading rate and plantar pressure of some areas may increase the potential risk of metatarsal stress fractures and plantar fasciitis. Therefore, this finding about turf cleats shoes could give some theoretic support for the design of turf cleats shoes and material optimization in the future.","This paper investigates how different outsole hardness of turf cleats influences lower limb kinematics and kinetics in soccer players performing specific movements on artificial turf. Key findings indicate that softer outsoles result in higher peak knee flexion and abduction angles during cutting maneuvers, while harder outsoles are associated with increased vertical loading rates and pressure in certain foot areas, potentially informing turf cleat design and material optimization."
Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: a systematic review,2017-05-31,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Grant L Iverson, Andrew J Gardner, Douglas P Terry, Jennie L Ponsford, Allen K Sills, Donna K Broshek, Gary S Solomon","Objective A systematic review of factors that might be associated with, or influence, clinical recovery from sport-related concussion. Clinical recovery was defined functionally as a return to normal activities, including school and sports, following injury. Design Systematic review. Data sources PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies published by June of 2016 that addressed clinical recovery from concussion. Results A total of 7617 articles were identified using the search strategy, and 101 articles were included. There are major methodological differences across the studies. Many different clinical outcomes were measured, such as symptoms, cognition, balance, return to school and return to sports, although symptom outcomes were the most frequently measured. The most consistent predictor of slower recovery from concussion is the severity of a person’s acute and subacute symptoms. The development of subacute problems with headaches or depression is likely a risk factor for persistent symptoms lasting greater than a month. Those with a preinjury history of mental health problems appear to be at greater risk for having persistent symptoms. Those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or learning disabilities do not appear to be at substantially greater risk. There is some evidence that the teenage years, particularly high school, might be the most vulnerable time period for having persistent symptoms—with greater risk for girls than boys. Conclusion The literature on clinical recovery from sport-related concussion has grown dramatically, is mostly mixed, but some factors have emerged as being related to outcome.","This systematic review examines various factors influencing clinical recovery from sport-related concussions, identifying key predictors such as the severity of acute symptoms and a history of mental health issues. The findings highlight significant variability in study methodologies and outcomes, particularly noting the vulnerability of teenagers, especially girls, to prolonged symptoms."

Therefore, research on deceptive actions for various sport disciplines (e.g., cricket, rugby, martial arts, soccer, basketball) has been conducted. This research is scattered, both across time and scientific disciplines. Here, we aim to systematically review the empirical work on deceptive actions in interactive sports and want to give an overview about several issues investigated in the last decades. Three main topics of the detected literature were discussed here: (1) the role of expertise for the recognition of deceptive actions;, (2) the cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of deceptive actions;, and (3) the pros and cons of in-situ research designs. NeitherNone of these themes seems to be settled and therefore, they should be considered in future research agendas.","This paper reviews deceptive actions in interactive sports, emphasizing their practical relevance and impact on opponents' performance.

The asymmetric forces of leg muscles and the associated asymmetric loading forces might promote major activation of the triceps surae, tibialis anterior, transverses abdominal and multifidus muscles. Here, we made infrared recordings of 21 sportsmen (elite professional soccer players) before activity and after 30 min of running. These recordings were used to assess temperature modifications on the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and Achilles tendon in GSE and non-GSE participants. We identified significant temperature modifications among GSE and non-GSE participants for the tibialis anterior muscle (mean, minimum, and maximum temperature values). The cutaneous temperature increased as a direct consequence of muscle activity in GSE participants. IR imaging capture was reliable to muscle pattern activation for lower limb. Based on our findings, we propose that non-invasive IR evaluation is suitable for clinical evaluation of the status of these muscles.","This paper investigates the application of infrared thermography to assess muscle temperature variations in elite soccer players with and without gastrocnemius-soleus equinus (GSE).

Accelerometer data were used for “high-risk” selection and during mentoring sessions to reinforce the technique-driven intervention. Outcome measures The change in top-of-head impacts and impacts with peak linear acceleration&gt;60 g was compared between intervention and control subjects using linear risk models. Coaches and players completed post-season exit surveys. Main results Ninety-seven players (70 intervention; 27 control) participated. Thirteen (19%) intervention players were identified as “high risk” and received mentoring. The mentored players’ high magnitude impacts (percent&gt;60 g) in practices dropped 1.9 percent from pre-intervention to post-intervention. There was no change in non-mentored players.

Exclusionary criteria: history of neurologic disorder, cervical spine injury, or head injury in the past 6 months. Interventions We implemented a soccer heading paradigm that consists of controlled soccer heading (12 headers at 11.2m/s from a JUGS machine) while measuring 3D motion capture kinematics (torso and head-to-torso range-of-motion), sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius EMG activity (peak and area), and linear and rotational accelerations using a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope. Head mass, neck girth, and sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius strength were also evaluated. Outcome measures Linear and rotational accelerations at the head center-of-gravity. Main results Multiple regression analyses suggest that the ten variables predicted linear (R2=0.272, p=0.002) and rotational (R2=0.259, p=0.004) acceleration; however none of the predictors individually made a significant contribution to the model. Linear and rotational accelerations were correlated with head mass (r=-?0.447, p&lt;0.001; r=-0.467,p&lt;0.001), neck girth (r=-0.465, p&lt;0.001; r=-0.438, p&lt;0.001), sternocleidomastoid strength (r=-0.386, p&lt;0.001; r=-0.410, p&lt;0.001), and upper trapezius strength (r=-0.311, p=0.001; r=-0.351, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Our findings suggest that head mass, neck girth, and neck strength are important in minimising head acceleration, whereby greater size and strength are associated with lower head accelerations. Soccer players with smaller head-neck segment masses and lower neck strength, may be at risk for greater head acceleration. These athletes may experience a theoretical bobble-head effect, when the neck strength is not great enough to control the mass of the head.

Intervention Participants completed testing prior to the start of their athletic seasons (T1), and again after the conclusion of each season (T2). Blood pressure (BP) oscillations were driven by stand-squat manoeuvres at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz. BP and cerebral blood velocity (CBV) in the middle cerebral artery were indexed non-invasively using finger photoplethysmography and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively. RM-ANOVA independent variables included time (2) and frequency (2). Outcome measures Point-estimates of coherence (correlation), phase (synchronisation), and gain (amplitude buffer) transfer function analysis metrics were calculated.

No differences existed by sport or recurrence. In sex-comparable sports, females had a mean 12.2 (SD=10.5) visits compared to 9.5 (SD=7.0) among males (p&lt;0.001). No sex differences existed in services per visit. Conclusions There are more AT room visits per concussion among females than males in sex-comparable sports. This is likely related to previous research finding symptom resolution time is longer in females than males. Identifying concussions that will require more AT services may help with resource allocation and planning for ATs.

Non-linear correlation between cumulative sub-concussive head impact trauma and severity of localised brain white matter changes in college athletes,2017-05-25,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Ralston John, Thibado Jason, Jonathan Woodard, Matthew Cieslak, Asturias Alex, Grafton Scott","Objective Test for a dose dependent relationship between cumulative sub-concussive head trauma loading and localised changes of brain white matter in college athletes. Design Prospective cohort study Setting NCAA Division I Women’s Soccer Participants 10 players were monitored for head impacts throughout a soccer season using wearable sensors. Linear and rotational accelerations recorded during impacts were processed to calculate the cumulative impact power. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) data were acquired at season start and at 3 additional intervals. 11 age and gender matched control data sets were acquired. Intervention One athlete suffered a concussion, was removed from play for neurocognitive testing, and entered a supervised return-to-play protocol. Outcome measures Cumulative impact power was used as a measure of the head trauma load accumulated prior to each MRI. Multi-dimensional anisotropy (MDA) values assessed localised severity of white matter changes. Session specific differences between each player’s MDA values and those of the control population were used to relate cumulative impact power and the severity of white matter changes. Main results Highly significant clusters of abnormal voxels were observed in athletes with no diagnosed concussion symptoms. Injury severity correlated with cumulative head impact power and demonstrated a pronounced threshold behaviour. MDA diffusion changes were located mainly within the frontal and occipital cortex at the gray-white boundary, and to a lesser degree in deep subcortical areas where there is a higher proportion of crossing fibres.

Previous concussion history influences neurological assessments following an acute bout of purposeful heading in women’s collegiate soccer,2017-05-25,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Thomas W Kaminski, Briana Kimmelmann, Jaclyn B Caccese, Joseph J Glutting","Objective Do differences in neurological assessments exists in a cohort of intercollegiate soccer players with varied concussion histories after an acute bout of soccer heading? Design Pre-posttest. Setting Soccer turf field and clinic. Participants 67 female collegiate soccer athletes (age=19.1 ± 0.9 yr.; mass=60.5 ± 5.0 kg; height=165.3 ± 5.9 cm). Based on their concussion history subjects were assigned to either the control/simulated heading [G1-17], control/heading [G2-22] 1–2 previous concussion/heading [G3-19], and 3 or more concussion/heading [G4-9] groups. Interventions Concussion symptoms (SX), BESS errors, ImPACT NP test scores were derived prior to and immediately after a bout of heading (15 total headers/15 minutes @ 12 m/s). Subjects returned to the clinic for post-testing immediately after heading. Outcome measures SX, BESS and NP scores pre and post ROT and LIN heading. Main results G3 (3.9±4.4) and G4 (5.1±6.0) demonstrated higher SX pre-heading compared to G1 (1.9±2.4) and G2 (3.2±3.7). Excluding G1, all groups showed elevated SX post-heading. There was a significant (p=.05) time by group interaction for SX whereby SX in G4 (7.8±7.1; 95% CI=4.9 – 10.7) were significantly (p=0.03) higher post-heading than G1 (2.0±2.5; 95% CI=−0.02 – 4.2). Conclusions Subjects in G4 had elevated SX at baseline, and those SX appear to be greatly exaggerated immediately following an acute bout of heading. Clinicians should carefully monitor soccer players who have experienced multiple concussions and be cognizant that they may develop concussion-like symptoms, especially after acute bouts of heading. Limitations in soccer heading should also be considered for this group of soccer athletes.

In a prospective cohort analysis of impact magnitude, frequency, and distribution on data collected with a wireless head impact sensor worn behind the ear of 23 players, a total of 4903 impacts were recorded. Players experienced on average 407 ± 143 impacts over the duration of the study resulting in 30 ± 38 impacts per-player per-match. Linear accelerations ranged from 10 g to 153 g with a mean, median, and 95th percentile value of 17 g, 13 g, and 40 g, respectively. Rotational accelerations ranged from 130 rad/s 2 to 21,890 rad/s 2 with a mean, median, and 95th percentile value of 2426 rad/s 2 , 1556 rad/s 2 , and 7571 rad/s 2 , respectively.

The location of impacts varied considerably with the back of the head recording more total impacts than the front, side, and top. Midfielders sustained more impacts per-player, per-match, and had higher median resultant linear accelerations than forwards and defenders. The results of this study, in which most impacts were within the low severity limit for linear, rotational, HIT SP , and RWE CP , indicate that Australian Rules football needs to include more encompassing methods of examination of player exposure.","This paper explores the frequency, magnitude, and distribution of head impacts experienced by players in a sub-elite Australian Rules football team using a wireless head impact sensor.

Hip and trunk muscle dysfunction: implications for anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention,2017-05-23,AME Publishing Company,Annals of Joint,"Kathryn C. Hickey Lucas, Paul W. Kline, Mary Lloyd Ireland, Brian Noehren","Abstract: Due to the short and long-term consequences of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, significant efforts have been devoted to identifying injury risk factors and develop screening and prevention tools. A growing body of evidence has identified hip and trunk muscle strength and functional performance as modifiable risk factors in ACL injury. Screening tools have been developed to capture hip and trunk function in order to identify athletes with elevated injury risk. Furthermore, ACL injury prevention programs include activities to improve hip and trunk strength and motor control during dynamic tasks. Because of the considerable focus and the growing body of evidence, the role of the hip and trunk in ACL injury etiology, screening tools, and prevention programs requires review and synthesis for improved implementation in clinical practice. Thus, the purpose of this review is to highlight the role of the hip and trunk in primary ACL injury, identify screening tests that may reveal deficits of the hip and trunk, and discuss the efficacy of prevention programs in correcting hip and trunk risk factors and ACL injury risk.","This paper reviews the role of hip and trunk muscle dysfunction in the context of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention.

However, limited evidence exists regarding the effects of 24 and 72 hours of kinesio taping on trunk and lower limb neuromuscular and kinetic performance during a vertical jump.The purpose of this study was to analyze the short-term effects of kinesio taping on height and ground reaction force during a vertical jump, in addition to trunk and lower limb muscle latency and recruitment order.Single-group pretest-posttest.University laboratory.Twelve male athletes from different sports (track and field, basketball, and soccer).They completed a single squat and countermovement jump at basal time (no kinesio taping), 24, and 72 hours of kinesio taping application on the gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and longissimus.Muscle onset latencies were assessed by electromyography during a squat and countermovement jump, in addition to measurements of the jump height and normalized ground reaction force.The kinesio taping had no effect after 24 hours on either the countermovement or squat jump. However, at 72 hours, the kinesio taping increased the jump height (P = .02; d = 0.36) and normalized ground reaction force (P = .001; d = 0.45) during the countermovement jump. In addition, 72-hour kinesio taping reduced longissimus onset latency (P = .03; d = 1.34) and improved muscle recruitment order during a countermovement jump.These findings suggest that kinesio taping may improve neuromuscular and kinetic performance during a countermovement jump only after 72 hours of application on healthy and uninjured male athletes.

Environmental and Physiological Factors Affect Football Head Impact Biomechanics,2017-05-16,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"JASON P. MIHALIK, ADAM Z. SUMRALL, SUSAN W. YEARGIN, KEVIN M. GUSKIEWICZ, KEVIN B. KING, SCOTT C. TRULOCK, EDGAR W. SHIELDS","Purpose Recent anecdotal trends suggest a disproportionate number of head injuries in collegiate football players occur during preseason football camp. In warmer climates, this season also represents the highest risk for heat-related illness among collegiate football players. Because concussion and heat illnesses share many common symptoms, we need 1) to understand if environmental conditions, body temperature, and hydration status affect head impact biomechanics; and 2) to determine if an in-helmet thermistor could provide a valid measure of gastrointestinal temperature. Methods A prospective cohort of 18 Division I college football players (age, 21.1 ± 1.4 yr; height, 187.7 ± 6.6 cm; mass, 114.5 ± 23.4 kg). Data were collected during one control and three experimental sessions. During each session, the Head Impact Telemetry System recorded head impact biomechanics (linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and severity profile) and in-helmet temperature. A wet bulb globe device recorded environmental conditions, and CorTemp™ Ingestible Core Body Temperature Sensors recorded gastrointestinal temperature. Results Our findings suggest that linear acceleration (P = 0.57), rotational acceleration (P = 0.16), and Head Impact Technology severity profile (P = 0.33) are not influenced by environmental or physiological conditions. Conclusions We did not find any single or combination of predictors for impact severity. Rotational acceleration was approaching significance between our early experimental sessions when compared with our control session. More research should be conducted to better understand if rotational accelerations are a component of impact magnitudes that are affected due to changes in environmental conditions, body temperature, and hydration status.","This paper investigates the relationship between environmental conditions, body temperature, hydration status, and head impact biomechanics in collegiate football players, particularly focusing on preseason training.

Teresa Anguera, Tiago Fernandes, Raúl Hileno","Research in soccer has traditionally given more weight to players' technical and tactical skills, but few studies have analyzed the motor skills that underpin specific motor actions. The objective of this study was to investigate the style of play of the world's top soccer players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and how they use their motor skills in attacking actions that result in a goal. We used and improved the easy-to-use observation instrument (OSMOS-soccer player) with 9 criteria, each one expanded to build 50 categories. Associations between these categories were investigated by T-pattern detection and polar coordinate analysis. T-pattern analysis detects temporal structures of complex behavioral sequences composed of simpler or directly distinguishable events within specified observation periods (time point series). Polar coordinate analysis involves the application of a complex procedure to provide a vector map of interrelated behaviors obtained from prospective and retrospective sequential analysis. The T-patterns showed that for both players the combined criteria were mainly between the different aspects of motor skills, namely the use of lower limbs, contact with the ball using the outside of the foot, locomotion, body orientation with respect to the opponent goal line, and the criteria of technical actions and the right midfield. Polar coordinate analysis detected significant associations between the same criteria included in the T-patterns as well as the criteria of turning the body, numerical equality with no pressure, and relative numerical superiority.","The paper investigates the motor skills employed by elite soccer players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo during goal-scoring actions, focusing on their attacking play.

The influence of gearing footwear on running biomechanics,2017-05-04,Informa UK Limited,Footwear Science,"John William Wannop, Anthony Killick, Ryan Madden, Darren J Stefanyshyn","The influence of nonlinear bending stiffness footwear, which alters the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint bending as a function of forefoot bending stiffness, has been postulated to improve athletic performance and reduce injury risk during many sports. As the shoe moves through greater amounts of bending, forefoot stiffness should increase nonlinearly, to shift the centre of pressure forward (improving performance), while restricting forefoot bending in regions where turf toe injury may result. Recently, materials which allow for stiffness modifications as a function of forefoot flexion angle have been developed; however, the efficacy of this technology is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to evaluate the influence of gearing technology (a variable bending stiffness shoe) on biomechanics during running and sprinting. Ten male recreational athletes performed running and sprinting in two footwear conditions consisting of an altered US 10 adidas 16.4 FXG cleat. The footwear was altered by placing carbon fibre insoles with variable (nonlinear stiffness) into the shoes creating two different conditions: Control (no insole) and the variable stiffness (varStiff) shoe (gearing insoles). Kinematic (joint angles) and kinetic (ground reaction force and 3D joint moments) data of the lower extremity were recorded during each movement. The results of the study indicate that the variable stiffness insoles did positively influence athlete lower extremity biomechanics. At the MTP joint, as running speed increased (and normal MTP bending range of motion increased), the variable stiffness insoles reduced the amount of MTP bending of the shoes and reduced the medial–lateral movement of the point of force application. Additionally, the variable stiffness insoles reduced key biomechanical injury risk variables, such as non-sagittal plane joint loading at the knee and ankle joint.",The paper evaluates the impact of variable bending stiffness footwear on running biomechanics among male recreational athletes. It highlights that the use of variable stiffness insoles improved lower extremity biomechanics by reducing metatarsophalangeal bending and minimizing injury risk factors at the knee and ankle joints during running and sprinting activities.
Return to Play and Decreased Performance After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in National Football League Defensive Players,2017-05-03,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Connor R. Read, Kyle T. Aune, E. Lyle Cain, Glenn S. Fleisig","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur commonly in football. Recent work has reported ACL reconstruction (ACLR) as one of several orthopaedic procedures with unfavorable outcomes for professional athletes. The performance impact to defensive players after surgery has not been quantified. Purpose: To quantify the effect of ACLR on the performance of defensive players by comparing them to a cohort of matched controls as well as to measure the effect of ACLR on athletes’ career length in the National Football League (NFL). Study Design: Case-control and cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Thirty-eight NFL defensive players with a history of ACLR from 2006 to 2012 were identified. For each injured player, a matched control player was identified. Demographic and performance statistics were collected from the online NFL player database. Players who returned after ACLR (n = 23) were compared with players who did not return (n = 15) using t tests and chi-squared analyses. Similarly, players who returned after ACLR (n = 23) were compared with their matched controls with t tests and chi-squared analyses. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was utilized to test for significant differences between performance before and after the season of the injury for the players in the ACLR group who returned (n = 23) and for their matched controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to test for differences in the rate of retirement between the groups. For all analyses, P values &lt;.05 were considered significant. Results: Approximately 74% (28/38) of athletes who underwent ACLR returned to play at least 1 NFL game, and 61% (23/38) successfully returned to play at least half a season (ie, 8 games). Athletes in the ACLR group who returned retired from the NFL significantly sooner and more often after surgery than their matched controls. In the seasons leading up to their injury, athletes who successfully returned to play started a greater percentage of their games (81%) and made more solo tackles per game (3.44 ± 1.47) compared with athletes in the ACLR group who did not return to play (54% and 1.82 ± 1.17, respectively) and compared with healthy control players (52% and 1.77 ± 1.19, respectively). After the season of surgery, athletes in the ACLR group who returned to play decreased to 57% games started and 2.38 ± 1.24 solo tackles per game, while their matched controls suffered no significant decreases. Conclusion: Players who successfully returned were above-average NFL players before their injury but comparatively average after their return.","This paper investigates the impact of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) on the performance and career longevity of NFL defensive players. The findings reveal that while a significant majority of players returned to play post-surgery, they experienced a notable decline in performance metrics and retired earlier than their matched controls, highlighting the challenges of recovery after ACL injuries in professional football."
Motion of the anterior cruciate ligament during internal and external rotation at the knee: A cadaveric study,2017-05-03,Wiley,Clinical Anatomy,"J. Peeler, J. Anderson, S. Piotrowski, G. Stranges","Despite advances in our understanding of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) anatomy and function, the change in position of the ACL during tibial rotation is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the movements of the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles of the ACL during 15° of medial and lateral rotation (with & without a shear force). Cadaveric knees (12 male/12 female) were dissected and mounted at 90° of knee flexion. Anthropometric features of the ACL and distal femur were recorded, and each bundle was marked at: femoral attachment (FA), midpoint of ligament (MP), and tibial attachment (TA). Digital images of ACL motion in the frontal plane were taken as the tibia was rotated about a fixed femur. Using digitizing software, the change in position of the markers was quantified. Measurements suggested the ACL pattern of motion was consistent between sexes, regardless of shear force. The greatest amount of movement of both the AM and PM bundles occurred at the TA marker. The FA marker moved more during medial rotation, and the MP and TA markers moved more with lateral rotation. The 20 lb-shear force affected medial rotation most. This study is the first to quantify movement of the ACL during medial and lateral tibial rotation. Data should assist surgeons to select a graft position that is capable of replicating the rotational movement of the native ACL, and help improve three-dimensional stability of the ACL reconstructed knee.

Relationship Between Passive Hip Range of Motion And Hip Muscle Activation During Landing,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Emma F. Zuk, Michelle C. Boling, Kevin R. Ford, Jeffrey B. Taylor, Anh-Dung Nguyen","Passive hip range of motion (ROM) is theorized to influence activation of the hip musculature during dynamic activity. A decrease in the activation of the hip musculature may lead to landing biomechanics that increase the risk of knee injuries. Understanding the relationship between passive hip ROM and hip muscle activation during landing is needed to identify individuals at risk for knee injuries. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between transverse plane hip passive ROM and hip muscle activation during a landing task. METHODS: Twenty female Division 1 soccer players (19.2±0.9yrs, 167.2±5.7cm, 65.9±6.6kg) volunteered to participate. Passive hip internal (HIR) and external (HER) ROM of the left limb was measured with participants prone and the knee flexed to 90 degrees using a digital inclinometer by a single examiner (ICC>0.87). The average of three HIR and HER ROM measures was used for analysis. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to assess activation of the gluteus medius (GMED) and gluteus maximus (GMAX) during 3 trials of a drop vertical jump (DVJ) task from a 31cm high box. The average root mean square amplitude (RMS) of the sEMG signal of the GMED and GMAX 150ms following initial contact across three DVJ trials was normalized to the peak RMS amplitude across three maximal voluntary isometric contractions (%MVIC). Pearson’s Product Moment Correlations were calculated to determine the relationship between passive hip ROM and muscle activation during the DVJ (p<0.05). RESULTS: Greater HIR ROM (39.9±11.1 degrees) was correlated with less GMAX activation during the DVJ task (RMS=0.61±0.40%MVIC, R=-0.53, P=0.02). HIR ROM was not correlated with GMED activation during the DVJ task (RMS=0.24±0.12%MVIC, R=-0.38, P=0.10). HER ROM (30.6±8.1 degrees) was not correlated to GMAX (R=0.10, P=0.69) or GMED activation (R=0.21, P=0.37) during the DVJ task. CONCLUSIONS: Greater HIR ROM potentially influences the length-tension relationship of the GMAX, decreasing its ability to effectively activate during dynamic activities and increasing the risk of knee injuries. Ongoing work is needed to examine whether the effects of hip ROM on muscle activation contribute to landing biomechanics known to increase risk of knee injuries.","This paper investigates the relationship between passive hip range of motion (ROM) and hip muscle activation during landing tasks in female soccer players. It finds that greater hip internal rotation ROM correlates with decreased gluteus maximus activation, suggesting that higher internal ROM may influence muscle performance and potentially increase the risk of knee injuries during dynamic activities."
Lower Limb Kinetic And Kinematic Effects Of An Arm Swing During Counter-movement Vertical Jumps,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Eric M. Mosier, Andrew C. Fry, Michael T. Lane, Patrick G. Moodie, Jonathan R. Moodie","PURPOSES: This study determined the effects of an arm swing on lower limb kinematics (joint ranges of motion; ROM) and kinetics (peak joint torques; Nm) during a CMVJ. METHODS: Fourteen healthy, recreationally active men (±SD; age=24.1±3.9 yrs, height=1.76±0.05 m, weight=82.6±10.6 kg) performed 6 CMVJ, 3 with an arm swing (AS) and 3 with no arm swing (NAS), in random order. The AS CMVJ began with the participant standing upright with arms fully raised above the head. The NAS CMVJ began with the dominant upper limb fully raised overhead, while the non-dominant hand remained on the iliac crest during the entire CMVJ. All jumps were performed by descending to an internal knee angle of 90°, using maximal effort, and reaching for an overhead target. A three dimensional markerless motion capture system (MCS; DARI, Lenexa, KS) was used to analyze the kinetic and kinematic data. T-tests and ANOVAs (*AS vs. NAS, †eccentric [ECC] vs. concentric [CON]; p<0.05) were performed on mean values from all 3 jumps for AS and NAS for each subject. RESULTS: Results for AS and NAS CMVJs are shown in the table. The AS CMVJ produced greater vertical jump height (VJH) an average of 0.07±0.03 m (3.0±1.3 in). The hips and ankles produced greater ECC and CON torques, less hip flexion, and greater time in the concentric phase during the AS CMVJ. The knees produced greater concentric torque, however there were no differences between jump conditions. The AS CMVJ also had greater time in the concentric phase of the jump. CONCLUSION: Compared to NAS, use of an AS produced a 13% increase in CMVJ height, and greater peak torques for the hips and ankles, even when comparing eccentric and concentric phases. The AS CMVJ also increased the duration of the concentric phase, thus permitting greater torque generation to increase CMVJ height.Table: No title available.","This study investigates the effects of arm swing on lower limb kinetics and kinematics during counter-movement vertical jumps (CMVJ) in healthy, recreationally active men. The findings indicate that an arm swing significantly enhances jump height and generates greater peak torques at the hips and ankles, along with increased duration in the concentric phase of the jump compared to jumps performed without an arm swing."
Effect of Different Sports on Hip and Knee Biomechanics in Adolescent Females During a Jump-Landing,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Kelci B. Besand, James M. Bothwell, J Craig Garrison, Joseph P. Hannon, Shiho Goto, Adam C. King","Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is common in adolescent female athletes, with those who participate in soccer (SC) being at the highest risk for primary and secondary ACL injury. However, little is known about the biomechanical differences that may contribute to the variance in injury rate between SC and other sports in adolescent females. Previous research demonstrates that college-age females who participate in SC exhibit greater frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) values than those who participate in basketball (BKB). PURPOSE: To assess for differences in hip and knee frontal plane kinematics between adolescent female SC and BKB players. METHODS: Cross-sectional study design. Females (N = 30) participating in BKB (Age = 15.33 ± 1.68 yrs; Ht = 167.14 ± 5.91 cm; Mass = 60.49 ± 9.59 kg) or SC (Age = 15.33 ± 1.68 yrs; Ht = 162.86 ± 3.84 cm; Mass = 56.55 ± 5.85 Kg). Participants had International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) scores ≥ 95, were healthy at time of testing, and were matched by age and side of dominance (DOM = limb used to kick a ball). During three separate jump-landing tasks, bilateral lower extremity joint angles and moments were assessed at initial contact. Joint displacement (DSP = maximum or minimum - IC) and FPPA (2-dimensional measure of knee valgus) were calculated. Separate independent t-tests were performed to examine differences between groups. RESULTS: DOM hip adduction (ADD) DSP was significantly greater in the SC group (9.51 ± 1.3°) compared to the BKB group (4.9 ± 3.1°, t(28) = -5.2, p < .001). DOM hip abduction DSP was significantly greater in the BKB group (-3.7 ± 3.2°) compared to the SC group (-1.0 ± 0.9°, t(28) = -3.1, p =.004). DOM FPPA negative DSP (knee varus) (BSK= -9.8 ± 8.0°, SC = -5.29 ± 3.9°, t(28) = −1.96, p = .05) and non-DOM FPPA negative DSP (BKB= -13.5 ± 4.4°, SC = -6.3 ± 3.0°, t(28) = -2.7, p = .01) was significantly greater in the BKB group compared to the SC group. No other significant differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Greater hip ADD DSP is associated with higher ACL injury risk. Female SC players may be at increased ACL injury risk partially due to higher hip ADD DSP exhibited during landing as compared to the BKB group. The ability of female BKB players to maintain greater knee varus when compared to SC may also contribute to the variance in ACL injuries in these sports.","This paper investigates the differences in hip and knee biomechanics between adolescent female soccer (SC) players and basketball (BKB) players during jump-landing tasks, highlighting the relationship between these movements and the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The findings reveal that greater hip adduction displacement in SC players may contribute to a higher ACL injury risk compared to their BKB counterparts, who demonstrate better knee varus control during landing."
The Effect of Tackling Form on Head Accelerations Experienced by Youth Football Players,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Eric Schussler, Richard Jagacinski, John Buford, Ajit Chaudhari, Susan White, James Onate","A head-up tackling style has been recommended to decrease head contact experienced during tackling. Specific performance metrics have been set to describe and instruct this tackling style including: extended neck position, vertical trunk, head across the front of the target, short steps, and low center of gravity. However, limited information exists regarding the effectiveness of the components of this tackling style on the head accelerations experienced by youth tacklers. PURPOSE: Determine the effect of components of a head up, tackling style on head accelerations. METHODS: Youth football players ages 9-13 (11.8 ± 0.8 age, 2.5 ± 2 years of experience) were fitted with the xPatch monitoring system (X2 Biosystems, Seattle WA) and tackled a weighted dummy in a laboratory setting. Out of 470 tackles the xPatch system recorded 231 tackles with a peak head acceleration over 6g. Motion data during these tackles were analyzed for cervical angle, trunk angle, pelvic height, step length, and head and pelvic velocity. Correlational analyses were performed between each movement variable and peak linear acceleration (PLA), peak rotational acceleration (PRA) and Head Impact Criterion over 15ms (HIC15) measures from the xPatch. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between: shoulder extension and PLA (r=-.141, r2= .020, p=.033), trunk angle and PLA (r=.224, r2= .050 p=.001), trunk angle and PRA (r=.202, r2=.040 p=.002), trunk angle and HIC15(r=.156, r2=.023, p=.018), step length and PLA(r=.138, r2=.019, p=.037) and step length and HIC15 (r=.131, r2=.018, p=.048). CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant correlations between measures of head acceleration and shoulder extension, trunk angle and step length the linear relationship between these values appears clinically negligible. The low strength of these relationships indicate these performance variables may not be responsible for the amount of head acceleration in low speed tackles. Additional analysis on this data should be completed to identify non-linear relationships and identify the interdependence of these variables. Measurements of live tackles during games and identification of other biomechanical parameters best correlated with head acceleration should also be determined, which could lead to more specific and effective tackling instruction.","The paper examines the impact of a head-up tackling style on head accelerations in youth football players, aiming to evaluate specific performance metrics related to this tackling form. While correlations were found between certain movement variables and head acceleration measures, the strength of these relationships was low, suggesting that these factors may not significantly influence head acceleration during low-speed tackles, indicating a need for further research on biomechanics in live game scenarios."
"Shoe Cushioning Reduces Impact And Muscle Activation During Landings From Unexpected, But Not Self-initiated, Drops",2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Weijie Fu, Xi Wang, Yang Yang, Yu Liu","The drop jump, regarded as “an active landing from a self-initiated drop” (self-initiated drop landing, SIDL), is an effective training modality to develop explosive strength. Contrarily, “a landing from an unexpected drop” (unexpected drop landing, UDL), which is mostly unanticipated, has been proposed to generate potentially hazardous alterations to impact absorption. To date, few rigorous scientific studies have been conducted to understand the impact mechanics and muscle activation characteristics of these two landing tasks and the role of shoe properties. PURPOSE: To investigate the shoe effects on impact biomechanics and muscular responses during drop landings. METHODS: Twelve male collegiate basketball players performed bipedal landings from self-initiated and unexpected drops (SIDL and UDL) from a 60-cm height wearing highly-cushioned basketball shoes (Bball) and minimally cushioned control shoes (CC). Sagittal plane kinematics, ground reaction forces (GRF), accelerations of the shoe heel-cup, and electromyography (EMG) of the tibialis anterior (TA), lateral gastrocnemius, rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps femoris (BF) were collected simultaneously. RESULTS: In SIDL, no significant differences were observed in peak vertical GRF, peak heel acceleration, or normalized EMG amplitude (root mean square, EMGRMS) for all muscles during either the pre- or post-activation phase between the two shoe conditions. In UDL, however, both peak vertical GRF (4.1±0.7 vs. 4.7±0.8 BW, p < 0.05) and heel acceleration (29±7 vs. 36±8 g, p < 0.05) were lower in Bball compared to CC. Furthermore, the EMGRMS of TA (17±6 vs. 24±8%, p < 0.05), RF (21±3 vs. 28±7%, p < 0.05), VL (28±5 vs. 35±4%, p < 0.05), and BF (9±4 vs. 14±5%, p < 0.05) muscles showed a decrease in Bball compared to CC within the 50 ms after contact. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that shoe cushioning may make only a limited contribution to reducing landing impact forces provided that neuromuscular adjustments occur properly during landings from self-initiated drops. However, in the situation when relevant muscles are not activated on purpose, as in landings from unexpected drops, wearing a highly-cushioned shoe decreases peak impact and muscle post-activation. Supported by NSFC grant (81302131).","The paper investigates the effects of shoe cushioning on impact biomechanics and muscle activation during two types of drop landings: self-initiated and unexpected. The findings reveal that while shoe cushioning does not significantly affect landing dynamics during self-initiated drops, it notably reduces impact forces and muscle activation in unexpected landings."
Influence of Force Application Strategies on Muscle Activation and Plantar Pressure during Maximal Ergometer Rowing,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Renae Jackson, Will Wu, Mimi Nakajima, Tiffanye Vargas, James Becker","The rowing stroke begins with the feet generation force against the foot stretcher. It has been suggested that force application at the foot stretcher can be a limiting factor to rowing performance, however it is unknown how different strategies of applying force underneath the feet influence muscle activation and force-time profiles. PURPOSE: To determine how different strategies of applying force underneath the feet influences muscle activation and force-time profiles during maximal ergometer rowing. METHODS: Seven collegiate rowers (5-female, 2-male) completed two trials of ten maximal strokes. Trial conditions consisted of instructional cues: “Push through the balls of your feet”, “Push through the heels of your feet”. EMG of the erector-spinal (ES), lastissimus-dorsi (LD), gluteus-maximum (GM), and rectus-femoris (RF) were bilaterally recorded, sampling at 1500Hz. Pressure distribution under both feet was recorded while using a wireless in-shoe plantar-pressure system sampling at 500Hz. Peak force and impulse were calculated in a custom MATLAB program for the total foot, heel, and forefoot regions, under both conditions. Timing of muscle activation, duration, and integrals (iEMG) of drive activation were calculated for the middle 5 strokes. Paired t tests were used to compare dependent variables between the conditions. RESULTS: Six participants produced significantly higher peak forces (517.6±109.8N, p&It0.012, d=1.57) and impulses (359.3±57.2N, p&It0.007, d=1.80) when pushing through the balls than when pushing through the heels. Three participants displayed the opposite pattern. EMG analysis did not reveal significant differences in onset, duration, or integration of muscle activation between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Rowers in this study can be separated into two groups based on their ability to produce force and generate impulse: those more effective at pushing through the balls of the feet, at those more effective at pushing through the heels. Future research may want to examine performance, strength, and flexibility parameters to determine whether this difference is a beneficial or detrimental adaptation. If certain strategies are associated with variables that determine successful performance, then coaches may use this information to improve rowing performance.","This paper investigates how different force application strategies at the foot stretcher impact muscle activation and force-time profiles during maximal ergometer rowing. Key findings indicate that most participants exhibited higher peak forces and impulses when pushing through the balls of their feet compared to pushing through the heels, suggesting that individual differences in force generation strategies may influence rowing performance."
Strength and Biomechanical Contributions to Vertical Ground Reaction Forces in a Single Limb Landing Task,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Alexa K. Johnson, Joshua D. Winters, Kathleen M. Poploski, Nicholas R. Heebner, Scott M. Lephart, John P. Abt","Reducing dynamic joint loading is a key strategy included in injury prevention landing mechanics programs. Previous research has noted the importance of increased knee flexion to reduce vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF), and the relationship between strength asymmetry and asymmetrical landing mechanics following injury. PURPOSE: To determine if and how landing kinematics at the hip, knee, and ankle, as well as quadriceps strength contribute to vGRF in a single limb landing task. METHODS: Thirty-four physically active males (Age: 27.6 ± 4.6yrs; Height: 177.74 ± 7.15cm; Mass: 84.31 ± 11.83kgs) completed a single limb drop landing off a 45.7 cm box onto a force plate. A 3D motion system was used to collect dominant (DOM) and non-dominant (NON) hip flexion at initial contact, peak knee flexion (PKF), knee flexion at initial contact (KFIC), peak ankle flexion, ankle flexion at initial contact and, peak vGRF. DOM and NON quadriceps strength (IKQS) was collected using an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/s. Simple linear regression models were run for each limb to detect independent contributions to vGRF. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to determine the best model to predict vGRF. RESULTS: KFIC independently accounted for 11.8% (p= 0.047) of the variance in DOM vGRF. No DOM limb multiple linear regression model was significant. KFIC and PKF independently accounted for 15.7% (p=0.021) and 16.5% (p=0.017) of the variance in NON vGRF, respectively. KFIC and IKQS as a multiple linear regression model accounted for 18.9% (p=0.043) of variance in NON vGRF. CONCLUSION: KFIC, on DOM and NON limbs, is the best sagittal plane kinematic predictor of vGRF, in a single limb drop landing task in physically active males. Despite IKQS not being an independent significant predictor on either limb, it improved KFIC prediction of vGRF on the NON limb. This study highlights how active males use sagittal plane knee motion and quadriceps strength to influence vGRF in a single leg landing task, as research has shown women are more likely to use hip and knee kinematic strategies. Active individuals with weak quadriceps and a stiffened knee at initial contact are likely at risk for injuries associated with increased impacts during single limb landings.","This paper investigates the relationships between landing kinematics at the hip, knee, and ankle, as well as quadriceps strength, in contributing to vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) during a single limb landing task. It finds that knee flexion at initial contact and peak knee flexion are significant predictors of vGRF, emphasizing their role in injury prevention strategies for active males."
Effect of Fatigue on Landing Biomechanics in Soccer Players with an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Ahmad Alanazi, Katy Mitchell, Toni Roddey, Alexis Ortiz","Fatigue has been shown to influence landing biomechanics in individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, no study has evaluated the effect of fatigue on landing biomechanics during a soccer-specific landing task in soccer players with an ACLR. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of fatigue on landing biomechanics during an unplanned landing task in soccer players following ACLR compared with healthy non-injured soccer players. METHODS: Eighteen soccer players with an ACLR (age, 26.11 ± 3.95 years; height, 1.70 ± 0.09 m; weight, 68.15 ± 9.64 kg, BMI, 23.52 ± 2.69 kg/m2, time since surgery, 5 ± 3.30 years) and 18 healthy non-injured soccer players (age, 25.83 ± 3.51 years; height, 1.66 ± 0.05 m; weight, 66.88 ± 10.37 kg, BMI, 24.09 ± 3.73 kg/m2) participated in the study. Subjects were assessed during an unplanned landing task before and after completing a Wingate fatigue protocol. The landing task included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force plates. An accumulation of 4mmol of lactate was indicative of fatigue. The outcome measures were peak flexion angles and extension moments of the hip, knee and ankle joints, peak pressure and electromyography activity of gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscles. A 2×2 ANOVA (fatigue×group) was performed for each outcome measure. RESULTS: There were no significant fatigue×group interactions for any of the outcome measures. There were significant main effects of fatigue (as compared to the non-fatigued landing) regardless of group. The fatigued landing showed greater hip flexion (F1,34 = 7.24, p = 0.01), greater knee flexion (F1,34 = 12.16, p = 0.001), and greater ankle dorsiflexion (F1,34 = 10.97, p = 0.002). Also, the fatigued landing demonstrated significantly greater hip extension moments (F1,34 = 7.71, p = 0.009), greater knee extension moments (F1,34 = 7.04, p = 0.012), greater ankle plantarflexion moments (F1,34 = 10.38, p = 0.003), and decreased quadriceps activity (F1,34 = 8.18, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Fatigue caused changes in landing biomechanics; however, these changes were not significantly different when the groups were compared. These results indicate that having an ACLR (at least 1 year post-surgery) does not appear to lead to sustained changes in landing biomechanics induced by fatigue.","The paper investigates the impact of fatigue on landing biomechanics during a soccer-specific task in players with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) compared to healthy players. It finds that while fatigue affects landing biomechanics by increasing flexion angles and extension moments at the hip, knee, and ankle, the differences between the ACLR and healthy groups were not statistically significant."
Visual Memory Influences the Effect of Soccer Ball Handling on Knee Valgus Angle while Cutting,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Scott M. Monfort, Jared J. Pradarelli, Dustin R. Grooms, James A. Oñate, Ajit M.W. Chaudhari","BACKGROUND: Sports injuries remain a major concern for athletes despite ongoing efforts to improve screening and prevention methods. Recent research suggests that neurocognition may play a role in the neuromuscular control associated with injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament tears. Additionally, sport-specific tasks, such as dribbling a soccer ball, are integral to playing sports, but may also influence lower extremity mechanics. The relationship between neurocognitive ability and biomechanics during a sport specific cutting task has yet to be investigated. PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between neurocognition and the effect of soccer ball handling on lower extremity mechanics during a side-step task. METHODS: Fifteen healthy male collegiate soccer players (20.8 ± 2.0 yr; 1.77 ± 0.07 m; 77.0 ± 8.6 kg) participated in the study. Participants performed anticipated 45° run-to-cut trials while dribbling a soccer ball (BH) and without dribbling (NB) while 3D kinematics and kinetics were recorded. Approach speeds of NB trials were matched to those of BH trials. Peak knee valgus angle (pKValA) and moment for the plant leg were calculated. Participants also completed the ImPACT® neurocognitive assessment to evaluate visual and verbal memory, reaction time, and visual motor speed. Composite scores from the neurocognitive assessment were entered as candidate linear regression predictors for the change scores in lower extremity biomechanical parameters (i.e., BH – NB). Promising models with respect to adjusted-R2 and Mallow’s Cp were further evaluated for significance (α=0.05) through linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A one unit decrease in the visual memory composite score (i.e., worse visual attention, scanning, and/or visual learning) was associated with an increase in pKValA of 0.25° ± 0.07° during the BH task compared to the NB task (R2 = 45.8%, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The detrimental effect of soccer ball handling during a side-step cut movement on knee valgus was found to be influenced by athletes’ visual memory ability. These results may suggest that athletes with a diminished capacity for visual memory may be less able to maintain optimal biomechanics while accommodating the demands of sport-specific tasks that require visual attention.","This paper investigates the relationship between neurocognitive ability, specifically visual memory, and lower extremity mechanics during a soccer-specific cutting task. The findings reveal that impaired visual memory is linked to an increased knee valgus angle while handling a soccer ball, suggesting that cognitive factors can influence biomechanical performance during sports tasks."
Effect of Previous Injury on Functional Movement Screening Outcomes,2017-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Joshua Hoffman, Michael Krill, Toren Moore, James Borchers, Timothy Hewett","To improve player safety, medical professionals use questionnaires, pre-participation physicals, screening tests, biomechanical analyses, and strength testing to describe characteristics of high risk athletes. The seven-test Functional Movement Screening (FMS) is widely used in current practice, and research efforts have demonstrated the efficacy of the FMS to predict future injury. However, the effect of previous injury on FMS scores has not been defined. Because previous injury is a significant predictor of subsequent injury, an understanding of the effects of previous injury on total FMS score is critical to assess the efficacy of the screening tool to predict future injury. PURPOSE: Determine the efficacy of the FMS evaluation to assess prior musculoskeletal injury. METHODS: From 2012-2015, 58 incoming football athletes completed the FMS and a medical history questionnaire. Trained sports medicine researchers performed the screens and distributed questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess the effectiveness of total FMS results to predict previous injury. The previously established ≤ 14 score cut-off was utilized to establish the two groups’ at-risk levels. The established cut-off was reported to indicate football players at-risk for serious injury defined as out of physical participation for > 2 weeks. RESULTS: 46 athletes reported a prior musculoskeletal injury compared to 12 that denied prior injury. The group of 46 athletes was equally split on FMS scores with 23 athletes that recorded a score of ≤ 14 and 23 athletes that recorded a score > 14. The group that denied previous injury (N=12) was also evenly split with 6 athletes that recorded of score of ≤ 14 and 6 with a score > 14. The FMS with a cut-off score of 14 recorded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.500. The positive predictive value was 0.793 with a negative predictive value of 0.207. CONCLUSIONS: Prior history of musculoskeletal injury as reported on the incoming medical questionnaire did not affect total score on the FMS with specificity or sensitivity. Future studies should evaluate the effects of previous injury on other clinical screening tools. In addition, better screening tools could be developed that assess the incidence of previous injury and risk of future injury.","This paper investigates the influence of previous musculoskeletal injuries on the outcomes of the Functional Movement Screening (FMS) among incoming football players. The study reveals that prior injuries did not significantly affect FMS scores, indicating a need for further research to explore the relationship between previous injuries and other assessment tools for predicting future injury risks."
Changes in Isokinetic Muscle Strength in Adolescent Soccer Players after 10 Weeks of Pre-Season Training,2017-04-28,Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.,The Open Sports Sciences Journal,"Michal Lehnert, Petr Stastny, James J. Tufano, Pavel Stolfa","Background: During soccer-specific movements, the strength of knee extensors and flexors is of great importance and achieving certain strength ratios between the two has been identified as an important parameter for reducing the risk of soft tissue injuries around the knee. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in isokinetic strength of the knee flexors and extensors and their strength ratios in elite adolescent soccer players. Methods: Before and after 10 weeks of standard pre-season soccer training with progressive eccentric hamstring exercises, the players (n=18; age 17.1±0.4 years) participated in isokinetic testing to assess concentric and eccentric peak torque at 60°·s -1 . Results: After 10 weeks of training, the peak eccentric torque of the non-dominant quadriceps increased (p=0.018; ω=0.24). Additionally, the average eccentric work increased in the dominant hamstrings (p=0.007; ω=0.23), dominant quadriceps (p=0.02; ω=0.31), non-dominant hamstrings (p=0.003; ω=0.25 and non-dominant quadriceps (p=0.01; ω=0.37). Lastly, the isokinetic functional ratio (eccentric hamstrings-to-concentric quadriceps) increased in favor of eccentric hamstring strength in the non-dominant limb (p=0.04; ω=0.31). Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that pre-season training induced suboptimal changes in the isokinetic strength of the knee flexors and extensors in elite adolescent soccer players. However, the lack of injuries combined with an apparent lack of preparedness explained by slow velocity isokinetic testing indicates that future research should investigate other forms of strength testing to determine soccer-specific preparedness such as isokinetic dynamometry at higher speeds ( i.e. 180°.s -1 or 240°.s -1 ) and traditional weight-room testing such as 1RM tests.","The paper evaluates the impact of a 10-week pre-season training program on isokinetic strength in the knee flexors and extensors of elite adolescent soccer players. It finds that while significant improvements in muscle strength ratios were observed, the results suggest that current training methods may not adequately prepare players for soccer-specific demands, highlighting the need for further research into alternative strength testing approaches."
The Effects of Specialization and Sex on Anterior Y-Balance Performance in High School Athletes,2017-04-27,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"Madeline M. Miller, Jessica L. Trapp, Eric G. Post, Stephanie M. Trigsted, Timothy A. McGuine, M. Alison Brooks, David R. Bell","Sport specialization and movement asymmetry have been separately discussed as potential risk factors for lower extremity injury. Early specialization may lead to the development of movement asymmetries that can predispose an athlete to injury, but this has not been thoroughly examined.Athletes rated as specialized would exhibit greater between-limb anterior reach asymmetry and decreased anterior reach distance on the Y-balance test (YBT) as compared with nonspecialized high school athletes, and these differences would not be dependent on sex.Cross-sectional study.Level 3.Two hundred ninety-five athletes (117 male, 178 female; mean age, 15.6 ± 1.2 years) from 2 local high schools participating in basketball, soccer, volleyball, and tennis responded to a questionnaire regarding sport specialization status and performed trials of the YBT during preseason testing. Specialization was categorized according to 3 previously utilized specialization classification methods (single/multisport, 3-point scale, and 6-point scale), and interactions between specialization and sex with Y-balance performance were calculated using 2-way analyses of variance.Single-sport male athletes displayed greater anterior reach asymmetry than other interaction groups. A consistent main effect was observed for sex, with men displaying greater anterior asymmetry and decreased anterior reach distance than women. However, the interaction effects of specialization and sex on anterior Y-balance performance varied based on the classification method used.Single-sport male athletes displayed greater anterior reach asymmetry on the YBT than multisport and female athletes. Specialization classification method is important because the 6- and 3-point scales may not accurately identify balance abnormalities. Male athletes performed worse than female athletes on both of the Y-balance tasks.Clinicians should be aware that single-sport male athletes may display deficits in dynamic balance, potentially increasing their risk of injury.","The paper investigates the impact of sport specialization and sex on anterior Y-balance performance among high school athletes, highlighting the potential risks of early specialization for developing movement asymmetries that could lead to injuries. The findings reveal that male athletes who specialize in a single sport exhibit greater anterior reach asymmetry and lower balance performance compared to multisport and female athletes, emphasizing the importance of specialization classification methods in assessing balance abnormalities."

Squat exercise in 4 different intensities (40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% one-repetition maximum [1RM]) was performed and its effects were evaluated in the performance of countermovement jump (CMJ), after 4 different recovery times (1, 3, 5, and 10 min). For this purpose, 25 young soccer players, underwent five experimental sessions. At the first session the control to determine 1RM in half-squat was carried out. The following four experimental sessions were comprised of four intensity combinations with four different recovery intervals in order to perform the CMJ test later, randomly determined and with 30-min interval between each combination. The conditions were compared using an analysis of variance with repeated measurements, followed by Bonferroni test, using 5% significance level (P<0.05). The different intensities investigated did not provide significant increases in CMJ height, but significant differences were noted in recovery time, where, at CMJ maximum height, 1-min interval was better than after 3 min (P<0.05), 5, and 10 min (P<0.001). On the average jump performances, 1-min interval resulted in better results (P<0.001) compared to other intervals. The 10-min recovery resulted in poorer performances compared to the other intervals (P<0.001). Our results indicate that regardless the intensity used in the half-squat exercise with elite young soccer players, the 1-min recovery time was more appropriate to promote an increase in vertical jump.","This study investigates the effects of different squat exercise intensities and recovery times on postactivation potentiation (PAP) in elite young soccer players. Key findings indicate that while varying squat intensities did not significantly enhance countermovement jump height, a 1-minute recovery interval resulted in better jump performance compared to longer recovery times."
Effectiveness of Neuromuscular Training Based on the Neuromuscular Risk Profile,2017-04-25,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Timothy E. Hewett, Kevin R. Ford, Yingying Y. Xu, Jane Khoury, Gregory D. Myer","The effects of targeted neuromuscular training (TNMT) on movement biomechanics associated with the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are currently unknown. Purpose/Hypotheses: To determine the effectiveness of TNMT specifically designed to increase trunk control and hip strength. The hypotheses were that (1) TNMT would decrease biomechanical and neuromuscular factors related to an increased ACL injury risk and (2) TNMT would decrease these biomechanical and neuromuscular factors to a greater extent in athletes identified as being at a high risk for future ACL injuries.Controlled laboratory study.Female athletes who participated in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports underwent 3-dimensional biomechanical testing before the season and after completing TNMT. During testing, athletes performed 3 different types of tasks: (1) drop vertical jump, (2) single-leg drop, and (3) single-leg cross drop. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the treatment effects of TNMT designed to enhance core and hip strength on biomechanical and neuromuscular characteristics. Differences were also evaluated by risk profile. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < .05.TNMT significantly increased hip external rotation moments and moment impulses, increased peak trunk flexion, and decreased peak trunk extension. Athletes with a high risk before the intervention (risk profile III) had a more significant treatment effect of TNMT than low-risk groups (risk profiles I and II).TNMT significantly improved proximal biomechanics, including increased hip external rotation moments and moment impulses, increased peak trunk flexion, and decreased peak trunk extension. TNMT that focuses exclusively on proximal leg and trunk risk factors is not, however, adequate to induce significant changes in frontal-plane knee loading. Biomechanical changes varied across the risk profile groups, with higher risk groups exhibiting greater improvements in their biomechanics.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of Targeted Neuromuscular Training (TNMT) in reducing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk by enhancing trunk control and hip strength in female athletes. The study finds that TNMT significantly improves specific biomechanical factors associated with ACL injury risk, particularly in athletes identified as high-risk, though it does not sufficiently alter frontal-plane knee loading."
The evaluation of the role of medial collateral ligament maintaining knee stability by a finite element analysis,2017-04-21,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Dong Ren, Yueju Liu, Xianchao Zhang, Zhaohui Song, Jian Lu, Pengcheng Wang","A three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of the knee joint was established to analyze the biomechanical functions of the superficial and deep medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) of knee joints and to investigate the treatment of the knee medial collateral ligament injury. The right knee joint of a healthy male volunteer was subjected to CT and MRI scans in the extended position. The scanned data were imported into MIMICS, Geomagic, and ANSYS software to establish a three-dimensional FEM of the human knee joint. The anterior-posterior translation, valgus-varus rotation, and internal-external rotation of knee joints were simulated to observe tibial displacement or valgus angle. In addition, the magnitude and distribution of valgus stress in the superficial and deep layers of the intact MCL as well as the superficial, deep, and overall deficiencies of the MCL were investigated. In the extended position, the superficial medial collateral ligament (SMCL) would withstand maximum stresses of 48.63, 16.08, 17.23, and 16.08 MPa in resisting the valgus of knee joints, tibial forward displacement, internal rotation, and external rotation, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum stress tolerated by the SMCL in various ranges of motion mainly focused on the femoral end point, which was located at the anterior and posterior parts of the femur in resisting valgus motion and external rotation, respectively. However, the deep medial collateral ligament could tolerate only minimum stress, which was mainly focused at the femoral start and end points. This model can effectively analyze the biomechanical functions of the superficial and deep layers of the MCLs of knee joints. The results show that the knee MCL II° injury is the indication of surgical repair.","This paper presents a three-dimensional finite element model of the knee joint to analyze the biomechanical functions of the superficial and deep medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) in maintaining knee stability and understanding treatment for MCL injuries. Key findings indicate that the superficial MCL withstands significant stresses during various movements, primarily at the femoral endpoints, while the deep MCL tolerates minimal stress, emphasizing the model's effectiveness in analyzing MCL biomechanics."
Do inter-continental playing styles exist?

Gorman, Mitchell Naughton, Colin Solomon","The current study applied social network analysis (SNA) to the passing networks leading to goals scored by successful teams during the knock-out stages of the 2016 European football championships (EURO) and COPA America football championships (COPA). The aim was to test SNA as a method for analysing the structure of passes leading to goals and to determine whether there were any differences between the passing networks associated with goals scored, by countries of the two different continents. The passes leading to goals during each tournament were represented as networks and analysed using SNA metrics. Additional analysis examined the duration of the networks, and location on the pitch in which the passing network originated and where the goals were scored from. No differences were found for all SNA metrics, network duration, and pitch locations between teams from the 2016 EURO and COPA tournaments. Despite previously reported differences in style between European football and football in the Americas, the findings indicate that the passing networks immediately prior to goals scored by teams from both continents are similar.","This paper explores the use of social network analysis (SNA) to compare the passing networks leading to goals scored in the 2016 EURO and COPA America tournaments.

Motor Findings in former National Football League Players (S9.004),2017-04-18,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Neurology,"Samuel Frank, Michael Alosco, Johnny Jarnagin, Jesse Mez, Christine Chaisson, Brett Martin, Robert Cantu, Yorghos Tripodis, Robert Stern","Objective: To examine later-life motor functioning in former National Football League (NFL) players. Background: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is associated with prior exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and clinically presents with cognitive, behavior, and mood symptoms. Motor disturbances have historically been prominent in former boxers with autopsy-confirmed CTE, but this has not been the case in recent day neuropathological studies among former NFL players with CTE. Design/Methods: 95 former NFL players (ages 40–69) were compared to 25 same-age male controls were examined using the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), Grooved Pegboard, and cognitive and behavior/mood evaluations. A cumulative head impact index (CHII) estimated RHI exposure. Principal Component Analysis generated clinical function composites. Analysis of Covariance controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) examined group differences on the MDS-UPDRS, BESS, and Grooved Pegboard. Partial correlations (age and BMI adjusted) tested the relationship between the MDS-UPDRS and the CHII and clinical function composite scores. Results: MDS-UPDRS scores were low for both groups, but significantly higher in the former NFL group (mean[SD]=5.26[4.25]) than in controls (mean[SD]=2.40[3.25]), p=0.020. A majority of NFL subjects received normal ratings on individual MDS-UPDRS items; a subset had slightly abnormal ratings. Former NFL players had worse BESS (p=0.032) and dominant (p=0.007) and non-dominant (p=0.001) Grooved Pegboard scores. The CHII and MDS-UPDRS were not associated (p>0.05). Worse MDS-UPDRS scores correlated with worse psychomotor speed/executive function (p=0.006). Conclusions: Former NFL players exhibited statistically significant worse motor function than controls, but their motor test performances were relatively normal and unrelated to RHI exposure. The biomechanics of head trauma in American tackle football may have less impact on motor brain regions compared to boxing. Future macro- and microstructural neuroimaging investigations in former NFL players will test this hypothesis.

Kinesiology tape mediates soccer-simulated and local peroneal fatigue in soccer players,2017-04-12,Informa UK Limited,Research in Sports Medicine,"Claire Farquharson, Matt Greig","To investigate the efficacy of kinesiology taping in mediating the influence of fatigue on ankle sprain risk, 12 male soccer players completed single-leg dynamic balance trials pre- and post-exercise (soccer-specific protocol, isokinetic ankle inversion/eversion protocol) in each of three counter-balanced taping conditions (no tape, zinc oxide tape ZO, kinesiology tape KT). Balance was quantified as the overall stability index (OSI) and directional stability indices of platform deflection. Soccer-specific fatigue only increased OSI in the no tape condition (p = 0.03), with ZO and KT trials negating a fatigue affect. Localized fatigue increased OSI in the no tape (p = 0.01) and ZO (p = 0.05) trials, with no increase in the KT trial. A similar pattern was observed in medio-lateral and anterio-posterior balance indices. KT mediates soccer-simulated and local peroneal fatigue, with practical implications for epidemiological observations of increased injury risk during the latter stages of match play.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of kinesiology taping in reducing the impact of fatigue on the risk of ankle sprains in soccer players. Key findings indicate that kinesiology tape can prevent balance deterioration due to both soccer-specific and localized fatigue, highlighting its potential for injury prevention during matches."
Does the FIFA 11+ Injury Prevention Program Reduce the Incidence of ACL Injury in Male Soccer Players?,2017-04-07,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Orthopaedics &amp; Related Research,"Holly J. Silvers-Granelli, Mario Bizzini, Amelia Arundale, Bert R. Mandelbaum, Lynn Snyder-Mackler","Background The FIFA 11+ injury prevention program has been shown to decrease the risk of soccer injuries in men and women. The program has also been shown to decrease time loss resulting from injury. However, previous studies have not specifically investigated how the program might impact the rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in male soccer players. Questions/purposes The purpose of this study was to examine if the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program can (1) reduce the overall number of ACL injuries in men who play competitive college soccer and whether any potential reduction in rate of ACL injuries differed based on (2) game versus practice setting; (3) player position; (4) level of play (Division I or II); or (5) field type. Methods This study was a prospective cluster randomized controlled trial, which was conducted in 61 Division I and Division II National Collegiate Athletic Association men's soccer teams over the course of one competitive soccer season. The FIFA 11+ is a 15- to 20-minute on-the-field dynamic warm-up program used before training and games and was utilized as the intervention throughout the entire competitive season. Sixty-five teams were randomized: 34 to the control group (850 players) and 31 to the intervention group (675 players). Four intervention teams did not complete the study and did not submit their data, noting insufficient time to complete the program, reducing the number for per-protocol analysis to 61. Compliance to the FIFA 11+ program, athletic exposures, specific injuries, ACL injuries, and time loss resulting from injury were collected and recorded using a secure Internet-based system. At the end of the season, the data in the injury surveillance system were crosshatched with each individual institution's internal database. At that time, the certified athletic trainer signed off on the injury collection data to confirm their accuracy and completeness. Results A lower proportion of athletes in the intervention group experienced knee injuries (25% [34 of 136]) compared with the control group (75% [102 of 136]; relative risk [RR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.61; p < 0.001). When the data were stratified for ACL injury, fewer ACL injuries were reported in the intervention group (16% [three of 19]) compared with the control group (84% [16 of 19]), accounting for a 4.25-fold reduction in the likelihood of incurring ACL injury (RR, 0.236; 95% CI, 0.193-0.93; number needed to treat = 70; p < 0.001). With the numbers available, there was no difference between the ACL injury rate within the FIFA 11+ group and the control group with respect to game and practice sessions (games—intervention: 1.055% [three of 15] versus control: 1.80% [12 of 15]; RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09-1.11; p = 0.073 and practices—intervention: 0% [zero of four] versus control: 0.60% [four of four]; RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-2.59; p = 0.186). With the data that were available, there were no differences in incidence rate (IR) or injury by player position for forwards (IR control = 0.339 versus IR intervention = 0), midfielders (IR control = 0.54 versus IR intervention = 0.227), defenders (IR control = 0.339 versus IR intervention = 0.085), and goalkeepers (IR control = 0.0 versus IR intervention = 0.0) (p = 0.327). There were no differences in the number of ACL injuries for the Division I intervention group (0.70% [two of nine]) compared with the control group (1.05% [seven of nine]; RR, 0.30; CI, 0.06-1.45; p = 0.136). However, there were fewer ACL injuries incurred in the Division II intervention group (0.35% [one of 10]) compared with the control group (1.35% [nine of 10]; RR, 0.12; CI, 0.02-0.93; p = 0.042). There was no difference between the number of ACL injuries in the control group versus in the intervention group that occurred on grass versus turf (Wald chi square [1] = 0.473, b = 0.147, SE = 0.21, p = 0.492). However, there were more ACL injuries that occurred on artificial turf identified in the control group (1.35% [nine of 10]) versus the intervention group (0.35% [one of 10]; RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02-1.10; p = 0.049). Conclusions This program, if implemented correctly, has the potential to decrease the rate of ACL injury in competitive soccer players. In addition, this may also enhance the development and dissemination of injury prevention protocols and may mitigate risk to athletes who utilize the program consistently. Further studies are necessary to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the program implementation and to analyze the efficacy of the FIFA 11+ in the female collegiate soccer cohort. Level of Evidence Level I, therapeutic study.","This study investigates the effectiveness of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program in reducing ACL injuries among male collegiate soccer players. Results indicate a significant reduction in ACL injuries in the intervention group compared to the control group, suggesting that the program can potentially mitigate ACL injury risk when implemented correctly."
Left ventricular biomechanics in professional football players,2017-04-05,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"T. G. von Lueder, A. Hodt, G. F. Gjerdalen, K. Steine","Chronic exercise induces adaptive changes of left ventricular (LV) ejection and filling capacities which may be detected by novel speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)-based techniques. A total of 103 consecutive male elite Norwegian soccer players and 46 age-matched healthy controls underwent echocardiography at rest. STE was used to assess LV torsional mechanics and LV systolic longitudinal strain (LS). Diastolic function was evaluated by trans-mitral blood flow, mitral annular velocities by TDI, and LV inflow propagation velocity by color M-mode. Despite similar global LS, players displayed lower basal wall and higher apical wall LS values vs controls, resulting in an incremental base-to-apex gradient of LS. Color M-mode and TDI-derived data were similar in both groups. Peak systolic twist rate (TWR) was significantly lower in players (86.4±2.8 vs controls 101.9±5.2 deg/s, P<.01). Diastolic untwisting rate (UTWR) was higher in players (-124.5±4.2 vs -106.9±6.7 deg/s) and peaked earlier during the cardiac cycle (112.7±0.8 vs 117.4±2.4% of systole duration, both P<.05). Untwisting/twisting ratio (-1.48±0.05 vs -1.11±0.08; P<.001) and untwisting performance (=UTR/TW; -9.25±0.34 vs -7.38±0.40 s-1 , P<.01) were increased in players. Augmented diastolic wall strain (DWS), a novel measure of LV compliance in players, was associated with improved myocardial mechanical efficiency. The described myocardial biomechanics may underlie augmented exertional cardiac function in athletes and may have a potential role to characterize athlete's heart by itself or to distinguish it from hypertensive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","This paper investigates left ventricular (LV) biomechanics in elite Norwegian soccer players, highlighting adaptations in LV ejection and filling capacities associated with chronic exercise. Using advanced imaging techniques, the study reveals important differences in LV mechanics between players and healthy controls, including variations in systolic twist rate, diastolic untwisting rate, and overall myocardial mechanical efficiency, which may contribute to enhanced cardiac function in athletes."
The Role of Postural Support in Young Adults’ Control of Stationary Kicking,2017-04-03,Informa UK Limited,Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport,"Ben Sidaway, Matthew Bouchard, Julie Chasse, Jonathan Dunn, Andrea Govoni, Breanne McPherson, Katherine Roy, David I. Anderson","The requirement for postural stability during the performance of motor skills has been clearly demonstrated in infants, but the necessity for such a postural substrate is not well documented in adults. The present study investigated the role of postural stability during a ballistic ball-kicking task in adults by providing varying degrees of external postural support.In the 1st experiment, 30 participants performed 20 maximal-velocity kicks under each of 3 conditions: grasping a rigid stable handle, light fingertip touch, and grasping a suspended elastic tube. A 2nd experiment with 16 participants varied the position of the stable handle to examine if the handle position in Experiment 1 might simply act as a fulcrum to enhance torque generation.In Experiment 1, ball velocity was significantly higher in the stable-grasp condition in both men and women with the men showing greater improvement relative to the other conditions. Experiment 2 showed that the position of the stable handle did not significantly affect kicking velocity, indicating that the handle was not simply acting as a fulcrum during the kick.Together, the findings suggest that postural stability may be a rate limiter in the performance of dynamic motor tasks in adults.","The paper investigates the impact of postural stability on the performance of stationary ball-kicking tasks in young adults by examining various degrees of external support during the kicks.

Historically, quantitative measures have been used to determine readiness to return to sport; however, they do not assess modifiable risk factors related to the quality of movement.To determine the effectiveness of a criteria-based rehabilitation progression and return-to-sport criteria on efficient return to activity and prevention of second injury in young athletes post-ACLR.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Between December 2010 and 2013, 42 skeletally immature athletes (mean chronologic age, 12 years; range, 10-15 years) who underwent ACLR using ipsilateral hamstring tendon autograft were prospectively evaluated. All athletes progressed through a criteria-based rehabilitation progression; were assessed at specific time frames for strength, biomechanical, and neuromuscular risk factors predictive of injury; and were provided targeted interventions. The final return to sport phase consisted of quantitative testing as well as a quality of movement assessment of several functional movements with progressive difficulty and sports-specific loading. Clearance for unrestricted activity was determined by achieving satisfactory results on both qualitative and quantitative assessments with consideration for the demands of each sport.The mean time for return to unrestricted competitive activity was 12 months. All but 3 (7%) athletes returned to their primary sport. Thirty-five athletes (83%) returned to unrestricted activity. Of the 6 (14%) who sustained a second injury, 3 (50%) were injured in sports they were not cleared for. All ACL reinjuries occurred in a cutting sport. Half of reinjuries occurred within 1 year of surgery, while the remaining occurred between 1 and 2 years. Eighty-three percent of reinjuries involved highly competitive cutting athletes.In our cohort, the combination of qualitative and quantitative data served as a good indicator for reducing risk and determining readiness to return to sport.","This paper investigates the return to sport in skeletally immature athletes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), emphasizing the prevention of second injuries through a quality of movement assessment and quantitative measures.

Goodkin, Donna K. Broshek, Max Wintermark, T. Jason Druzgal","The effects of head impact in sports are of growing interest for clinicians, scientists, and athletes. Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide, but the burden of head impact in collegiate soccer is still unknown.To quantify head impact associated with practicing and playing collegiate soccer using wearable accelerometers.Descriptive epidemiological study.Mastoid patch accelerometers were used to quantify head impact in soccer, examining differences in head impact as a function of sex and event type (practice vs game). Seven female and 14 male collegiate soccer players wore mastoid patch accelerometers that measured head impacts during team events. Data were summarized for each athletic exposure, and statistical analyses evaluated the mean number of impacts, mean peak linear acceleration, mean peak rotational acceleration, and cumulative linear and rotational acceleration, each grouped by sex and event type.There were no differences in the frequency or severity of head impacts between men's and women's soccer practices. For men's soccer, games resulted in 285% more head impacts than practices, but there were no event-type differences in mean impact severity. Men's soccer games resulted in more head impacts than practices across nearly all measured impact severities, which also resulted in men's soccer games producing a greater cumulative impact burden.Similar to other sports, men's soccer games have a greater impact burden when compared with practices, and this effect is driven by the quantity rather than severity of head impacts. In contrast, there were no differences in the quantity or severity of head impacts in men's and women's soccer practices. These data could prompt discussions of practical concern to collegiate soccer, such as understanding sex differences in head impact and whether games disproportionately contribute to an athlete's head impact burden.","This paper investigates head impacts in collegiate soccer, focusing on differences based on sex and event type (practice vs. game).

Effects of a 12-month complex proprioceptive-coordinative training program on soccer performance in prepubertal boys aged 10-11 years. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1380-1393, 2019-The aim was to examine the effects of a series of on-field proprioceptive-coordinative (P-C) exercises on motor performance (MP) in prepubertal soccer players. Fifty-three male soccer players aged 10.1-11.8 years were randomized among 2 experimental programs receiving P-C training (P-CT; n = 26) or regular training (RT; n = 27). A control group (C; n = 22) consisted of age-matched (10.3-11.9 years) cohorts not involved in any regular physical activity. Both experimental groups completed an identical 12-month comprehensive soccer program except training in P-CT was modified to substitute small-sided conditioning games with 24 multimode P-C exercises with modulated exercise intensity (every 8-9 weeks based on predicted maximal heart rate [HRmax]). Pre-, peri-, and posttraining measures included anthropometry and 5 tests assessing soccer-specific MP: movement rhythm (turning the ball backwards-T1), motor adaptation (running with the ball around poles-T2), spatial orientation (running to sequentially numbered balls-T3), balance (single-leg static balance-T4), and kinesthetic differentiation of movement (landing the ball on a 2 × 2 m sector-T5). Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed no significance between-group differences for age, anthropometry, and body-fat percentage at baseline. Significant main effects for group (P-CT vs. RT) were found in all tests (T1-T5) and main effects for time (group P-CT) in T3-T5, whereas a significant group × time interaction was observed only in T4 (F = 2.98, p = 0.0204). Post hoc tests indicated that P-CT attained significantly better results than RT at peritraining (by 26.4%; p < 0.01) and posttraining (by 31.9%, p < 0.01). Modulated exercise intensity had little effect on soccer performance (T1-T3, T5). Based on the results, it is recommended that the training of young soccer players be supplemented with the bilateral balance exercises and games used in the study. Furthermore, the suitability of monitoring HR in P-C exercises targeting the analyzed MP skills is questionable.","This paper investigates the impact of a 12-month proprioceptive-coordinative training program on the motor performance of prepubertal soccer players aged 10-11 years.

The effects of sub-concussive head impacts on the functional connectivity of the brain are still unclear with no conclusive results yet presented. Although various studies have been performed on the topic, they have yielded mixed results with some concluding that sub concussive head impacts do not have any effect on functional connectivity, while others concluding that there are acute to chronic effects. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an effect on the functional connectivity of the brain from repetitive sub concussive head impacts. First, we applied a model free group ICA based intrinsic network selection to consider the relationship between all voxels while avoiding an arbitrary choice of seed selection. Second, unlike most other studies, we have utilized the default mode network along with other extracted intrinsic networks for classification. Third, we systematically tested multiple supervised machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a player was a non-contact sports youth player, a contact sports player with low levels of cumulative biomechanical force impacts, or one with high levels of exposure. The 10-fold cross validation results show robust classification between the groups with accuracy up to 78% establishing the potential of data driven approaches coupled with machine learning to study connectivity changes in youth football players. This work adds to the growing body of evidence that there are detectable changes in brain signature from playing a single season of contact sports.","This paper investigates the effects of sub-concussive head impacts on brain functional connectivity in youth football players throughout a single season.

Exclusion criteria: (1) data reported in conference abstracts or non-peer-reviewed literature, including theses, and (2) studies employing cross-sectional or retrospective study designs. Results 24 studies were appraised using the Quality of Cohort Studies assessment tool. In male military personnel, there was ‘strong’ evidence that the strength of association between FMS composite score (cut-point ≤14/21) and subsequent injury was ‘small’ (pooled risk ratio=1.47, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.77, p&lt;0.0001, I 2 =57%). There was ‘moderate’ evidence to recommend against the use of FMS composite score as an injury prediction test in football (soccer). For other populations (including American football, college athletes, basketball, ice hockey, running, police and firefighters), the evidence was ‘limited’ or ‘conflicting’. Conclusion The strength of association between FMS composite scores and subsequent injury does not support its use as an injury prediction tool. Trial registration number PROSPERO registration number CRD42015025575.","This paper systematically reviews the association between Functional Movement Screen (FMS) composite scores and the subsequent risk of injury, highlighting the limited predictive validity of FMS scores in football. The findings indicate strong evidence of a small association in male military personnel, but moderate evidence against its use in football and conflicting evidence in other athletic populations."
Preferred Hip Strategy During Landing Reduces Knee Abduction Moment in Collegiate Female Soccer Players,2017-03-24,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Anh-Dung Nguyen, Jeffrey B. Taylor, Taylor G. Wimbish, Jennifer L. Keith, Kevin R. Ford","Hip-focused interventions are aimed to decrease frontal plane knee loading related to anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Whether a preferred hip landing strategy decreases frontal plane knee loading is unknown.To determine if a preferred hip landing strategy during a drop vertical jump (DVJ) is utilized during a single-leg landing (SLL) task and whether differences in frontal plane knee loading are consistent between a DVJ and an SLL task.Descriptive laboratory study.Research laboratory.Twenty-three collegiate, female soccer players.Participants were dichotomized into a hip (HIP; n = 9) or knee/ankle (KA; n = 14) strategy group based on the percentage distribution of each lower extremity joint relative to the summated moment (% distribution) during the DVJ. Separate 1-way analysis of variances examined the differences in joint-specific % distribution and external knee abduction moment between the HIP and KA groups.The HIP group had significantly greater % distribution of hip moment and less % distribution of knee moment compared with the KA group during the DVJ and SLL. External knee abduction moment was also significantly less in the HIP group compared with the KA group during the DVJ.Female soccer athletes who land with a preferred hip strategy during a DVJ also land with a preferred hip strategy during an SLL. The preferred hip strategy also resulted in less external knee abduction moments during the DVJ.Targeting the neuromuscular control of the hip extensor may be useful in reducing risk of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries.","This paper investigates the impact of a preferred hip landing strategy on knee abduction moments in collegiate female soccer players. It finds that those utilizing a hip strategy during a drop vertical jump also adopt this strategy in a single-leg landing, resulting in reduced external knee abduction moments, suggesting that focusing on hip control may lower the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries."
Sprint Interval Training Induces A Sexual Dimorphism but does not Improve Peak Bone Mass in Young and Healthy Mice,2017-03-17,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Kathrin Koenen, Isabell Knepper, Madlen Klodt, Anja Osterberg, Ioannis Stratos, Thomas Mittlmeier, Tina Histing, Michael D. Menger, Brigitte Vollmar, Sven Bruhn, Brigitte Müller-Hilke","Abstract Elevated peak bone mass in early adulthood reduces the risk for osteoporotic fractures at old age. As sports participation has been correlated with elevated peak bone masses, we aimed to establish a training program that would efficiently stimulate bone accrual in healthy young mice. We combined voluntary treadmill running with sprint interval training modalities that were tailored to the individual performance limits and were of either high or intermediate intensity. Adolescent male and female STR/ort mice underwent 8 weeks of training before the hind legs were analyzed for cortical and trabecular bone parameters and biomechanical strength. Sprint interval training led to increased running speeds, confirming an efficient training. However, males and females responded differently. The males improved their running speeds in response to intermediate intensities only and accrued cortical bone at the expense of mechanical strength. High training intensities induced a significant loss of trabecular bone. The female bones showed neither adverse nor beneficial effects in response to either training intensities. Speculations about the failure to improve geometric alongside mechanical bone properties include the possibility that our training lacked sufficient axial loading, that high cardio-vascular strains adversely affect bone growth and that there are physiological limits to bone accrual.","The paper investigates the effects of sprint interval training on peak bone mass in young mice, highlighting a sexual dimorphism in responses to the training regimen. While males saw improvements in running speed and changes in bone parameters, neither training intensity improved bone mass, particularly noting that high intensities led to trabecular bone loss, with females showing no significant effects."
Tri-Axial Accelerometry as an Injury Predictor Tool in Elite Soccer,2017-03-14,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Athletic Therapy and Training,"Wayne Brown, Matt Greig","The epidemiology and etiology of ankle sprain injuries in soccer have been well described. Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data identified an English Premier League player sustaining a high lateral ankle sprain. GPS data collated during the training session in which the injury was sustained, and subsequent rehabilitation sessions, were analyzed to quantify uniaxial PlayerLoad metrics. The injured player revealed a 3:1 asymmetrical loading pattern in the mediolateral plane and multiaxial high loading events which might present the inciting event to injury. The high magnitude, asymmetrical and multiplanar loading is consistent with lateral ankle sprain etiology.","This paper investigates the use of tri-axial accelerometry as a tool for predicting ankle sprain injuries in elite soccer players by analyzing GPS data from a specific training session.

Reliability of lower limb biomechanics in two sport-specific sidestep cutting tasks,2017-03-10,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Kam-Ming Mok, Roald Bahr, Tron Krosshaug","The purpose of this study was to assess the within- and between-session reliability of lower limb biomechanics in two sport-specific sidestep cutting tasks performed by elite female handball and football (soccer) athletes. Moreover, we aimed at determining the minimum number of trials necessary to obtain a reliable measure. Nineteen elite female handball and 22 elite female football (soccer) athletes (M ± SD: 22 ± 4 yrs old, 168 ± 5 cm, 66 ± 8 kg) were tested. The reliability was quantified by intra-class correlations (ICCs), typical error and Spearman's rank correlation. Only minor improvements in ICC values were seen when increasing the number of trials from 3 to 5. Based on trials 1-3, all variables showed good to excellent within-session reliability (M ICC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.89-0.93), fair to good between-session reliability (M ICC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.70-0.76), moderately positive between-session rank correlation coefficients (M: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.69-0.76). A few frontal plane biomechanical variables displayed lower between-session reliability in the football task compared with the handball task. The moderately positive between-session ranking and practically small typical error implies that the measurements could reliably reproduce the ranking of individuals in multiple-session studies. Adequate reliability could be attained from 3 trials, with only minor improvements when adding more trials.","This paper investigates the reliability of lower limb biomechanics during two sidestep cutting tasks in elite female handball and football athletes. Key findings indicate that adequate reliability can be achieved with just three trials, and while within-session reliability is high, between-session reliability varies, particularly in certain biomechanical variables for football tasks."

Manual reference checks, ahead of press searches, citation tracking. From inception to June 2016. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies evaluating and presenting data related to intrinsic or extrinsic risk factors for sustaining future calf injury. Results Ten studies were obtained for review. Subjects across football, Australian football, rugby union, basketball and triathlon were reported on, representing 5397 athletes and 518 calf/ lower leg muscle injuries. Best evidence synthesis highlights chronological age and previous history of calf strain are the strongest risk factors for future calf muscle injury. Previous lower limb injuries (hamstring, quadriceps, adductor, knee) show some limited evidence for an association. Numerous factors lack evidence of an association, including height, weight, gender and side dominance.

Proximal Neuromuscular Control Protects Against Hamstring Injuries in Male Soccer Players: A Prospective Study With Electromyography Time-Series Analysis During Maximal Sprinting,2017-03-01,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Joke Schuermans, Lieven Danneels, Damien Van Tiggelen, Tanneke Palmans, Erik Witvrouw","Background: With their unremittingly high incidence rate and detrimental functional repercussions, hamstring injuries remain a substantial problem in male soccer. Proximal neuromuscular control (“core stability”) is considered to be of key importance in primary and secondary hamstring injury prevention, although scientific evidence and insights on the exact nature of the core-hamstring association are nonexistent at present. Hypothesis: The muscle activation pattern throughout the running cycle would not differ between participants based on injury occurrence during follow-up. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Sixty amateur soccer players participated in a multimuscle surface electromyography (sEMG) assessment during maximal acceleration to full-speed sprinting. Subsequently, hamstring injury occurrence was registered during a 1.5-season follow-up period. Hamstring, gluteal, and trunk muscle activity time series during the airborne and stance phases of acceleration were evaluated and statistically explored for a possible causal association with injury occurrence and absence from sport during follow-up. Results: Players who did not experience a hamstring injury during follow-up had significantly higher amounts of gluteal muscle activity during the front swing phase ( P = .027) and higher amounts of trunk muscle activity during the backswing phase of sprinting ( P = .042). In particular, the risk of sustaining a hamstring injury during follow-up lowered by 20% and 6%, with a 10% increment in normalized muscle activity of the gluteus maximus during the front swing and the trunk muscles during the backswing, respectively ( P &lt; .024). Conclusion: Muscle activity of the core unit during explosive running appeared to be associated with hamstring injury occurrence in male soccer players. Higher amounts of gluteal and trunk muscle activity during the airborne phases of sprinting were associated with a lower risk of hamstring injuries during follow-up. Hence, the present results provide a basis for improved, evidence-based rehabilitation and prevention, particularly focusing on increasing neuromuscular control of the gluteal and trunk muscles during sport-specific activities (eg, sprint drills, agility drills).","This study investigates the role of proximal neuromuscular control in preventing hamstring injuries in male soccer players through electromyography analysis during sprinting. The findings reveal that increased gluteal and trunk muscle activity during sprinting is associated with a reduced risk of hamstring injuries, suggesting the importance of enhancing neuromuscular control in injury prevention strategies."
SoccerMate: A personal soccer attribute profiler using wearables,2017-03-01,IEEE,2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops),"H M Sajjad Hossain, Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan, Nirmalya Roy","The use of smartphone and wearable devices in various sporting events is an optimistic opportunity to profile player's physical fitness and physiological health conditioning attributes. Recently a variety of commercial wearables with respect to different sports are available in the market. As these wearables differ for distinctive sports, it becomes a hassle to effectively profile them for multiple sports sessions in day to day practice events. Wrist worn devices like smartwatches are becoming a trend in sports analytics recently and researchers are leveraging them to infer various contexts of the players to improve the quality, tactics, strategy of playing matches against the opponents. Visual observation is the most popular way to track a player's abilities in soccer, but as a player it is not always possible to self-assess your own strengths and weaknesses in a field. In this paper, we propose to exploit the wrist worn devices with built in accelerometer to help represent attributes of technical judgement, tactical awareness and physical aspects of a soccer player. We propose to use deep learning to build our classification model which analyzes different soccer events like in-possession, pass, kick, sprint, run and dribbling. Based on these soccer events, we evaluate the overall ability of a soccer player. Our experiments show that, these wearable technology guided attributes profiling can help a coach or scout to better understand the competence of a player in addition to traditional visual observation.","The paper discusses the development of SoccerMate, a profiling system that utilizes wearable devices to evaluate soccer players' physical fitness and physiological attributes.

Factors that influence ground reaction force profiles during counter movement jumping,2017-03-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Alexander N. Eagles, Mark G. Sayers, Dale I. Lovell","The purpose of this study was to examine how hip, knee and ankle kinetics and kinematics influence effective impulse production during countermovement jumps.Eighteen semi-professional soccer players (22.8±2.2 years) volunteered to participate in the study. Participants completed three maximal countermovement jumps on two force platforms (1000 Hz) that were linked to a nine camera infrared motion capture system (500 Hz).Kinetic and kinematic data revealed jumpers who fail to achieve uniform ground reaction force curves that result in optimal impulse production during their jump always display hip adduction and or hip internal rotation during the concentric phase of the countermovement jump. The variation of hip adduction and or internal rotation likely represents failed joint transition during the concentric phase of the countermovement jump and appears to account for a non-uniform force trace seen in these jumpers.The findings suggest rehabilitation and conditioning exercises for injury prevention and performance may benefit from targeting frontal and transverse plane movement.","The paper investigates how hip, knee, and ankle kinetics and kinematics affect impulse production during countermovement jumps in semi-professional soccer players. The study identifies that non-uniform ground reaction force profiles, linked to hip adduction or internal rotation during the jump's concentric phase, may indicate poor joint transition and suggests that targeted rehabilitation and conditioning could enhance performance and prevent injuries."

Muscle activity in sprinting: a review,2017-02-28,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Róisín M. Howard, Richard Conway, Andrew J. Harrison","The use of electromyography (EMG) is widely recognised as a valuable tool for enhancing the understanding of performance drivers and potential injury risk in sprinting. The timings of muscle activations relative to running gait cycle phases and the technology used to obtain muscle activation data during sprinting are of particular interest to scientists and coaches. This review examined the main muscles being analysed by surface EMG (sEMG), their activations and timing, and the technologies used to gather sEMG during sprinting. Electronic databases were searched using 'Electromyography' OR 'EMG' AND 'running' OR 'sprinting'. Based on inclusion criteria, 18 articles were selected for review. While sEMG is widely used in biomechanics, relatively few studies have used sEMG in sprinting due to system constraints. The results demonstrated a focus on the leg muscles, with over 70% of the muscles analysed in the upper leg. This is consistent with the use of tethered and data logging EMG systems and many sprints being performed on treadmills. Through the recent advances in wireless EMG technology, an increase in the studies on high velocity movements such as sprinting is expected and this should allow practitioners to perform the analysis in an ecologically valid environment.","This paper reviews the use of electromyography (EMG) in analyzing muscle activity during sprinting, focusing on the timing and activation of leg muscles relevant to running gait cycles. It highlights the constraints in current research due to limited studies and technology, while anticipating that advances in wireless EMG technology will enhance future investigations into high-velocity movements like sprinting."

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of allocation of attention imposed by a secondary cognitive task on landing mechanics and jump performance. Thirty-eight recreational athletes performed a jump-landing task in three conditions: no counting, counting backward by 1 s from a randomly given number, and counting backward by 7 s from a randomly given number. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected and analysed. Participants demonstrated decreased knee flexion angles at initial contact (p = 0.001) for the counting by 1 s condition compared with the no counting condition. Participants also showed increased peak posterior and vertical ground reaction forces during the first 100 ms of landing (p ≤ 0.023) and decreased jump height (p < 0.001) for the counting by 1 s and counting by 7 s conditions compared with the no counting condition. Imposition of a simultaneous cognitive challenge resulted in landing mechanics associated with increased ACL loading and decreased jump performance. ACL injury risk screening protocols and injury prevention programmes may incorporate cognitive tasks into jump-landing tasks to better simulate sports environments.","This paper investigates the impact of a secondary cognitive task on landing mechanics and jump performance during jump-landing tasks, specifically focusing on how attention allocation may increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries.

Gavião Neto, Maria Isabel Roveri, Wagner R. Oliveira, Isabel CN Sacco","Resilience of midsole material and the upper structure of the shoe are conceptual characteristics that can interfere in running biomechanics patterns. Artificial intelligence techniques can capture features from the entire waveform, adding new perspective for biomechanical analysis. This study tested the influence of shoe midsole resilience and upper structure on running kinematics and kinetics of non-professional runners by using feature selection, information gain, and artificial neural network analysis.Twenty-seven experienced male runners (63 ± 44 km/week run) ran in four-shoe design that combined two resilience-cushioning materials (low and high) and two uppers (minimalist and structured). Kinematic data was acquired by six infrared cameras at 300 Hz, and ground reaction forces were acquired by two force plates at 1,200 Hz. We conducted a Machine Learning analysis to identify features from the complete kinematic and kinetic time series and from 42 discrete variables that had better discriminate the four shoes studied. For that analysis, we built an input data matrix of dimensions 1,080 (10 trials × 4 shoes × 27 subjects) × 1,254 (3 joints × 3 planes of movement × 101 data points + 3 vectors forces × 101 data points + 42 discrete calculated kinetic and kinematic features).The applied feature selection by information gain and artificial neural networks successfully differentiated the two resilience materials using 200(16%) biomechanical variables with an accuracy of 84.8% by detecting alterations of running biomechanics, and the two upper structures with an accuracy of 93.9%.The discrimination of midsole resilience resulted in lower accuracy levels than did the discrimination of the shoe uppers. In both cases, the ground reaction forces were among the 25 most relevant features. The resilience of the cushioning material caused significant effects on initial heel impact, while the effects of different uppers were distributed along the stance phase of running. Biomechanical changes due to shoe midsole resilience seemed to be subject-dependent, while those due to upper structure seemed to be subject-independent.","This paper investigates the impact of EVA midsole resilience and upper shoe structure on the running biomechanics of non-professional runners using a machine learning approach.

The effect of unilateral arm swing motion on lower extremity running mechanics associated with injury risk,2017-02-28,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Cristine Agresta, Christian R. Ward, W. Geoffrey Wright, Carole A. Tucker","Many field sports involve equipment that restricts one or both arms from moving while running. Arm swing during running has been examined from a biomechanical and physiologic perspective but not from an injury perspective. Moreover, only bilateral arm swing suppression has been studied with respect to running. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of running with one arm restrained on lower extremity mechanics associated with running or sport-related injury. Fifteen healthy participants ran at a self-selected speed with typical arm swing, with one arm restrained and with both arms restrained. Lower extremity kinematics and spatiotemporal measures were analysed for all arm swing conditions. Running with one arm restrained resulted in increased frontal plane knee and hip angles, decreased foot strike angle, and decreased centre of mass vertical displacement compared to typical arm swing or bilateral arm swing restriction. Stride length was decreased and step frequency increased when running with one or both arms restrained. Unilateral arm swing restriction induces changes in lower extremity kinematics that are not similar to running with bilateral arm swing restriction or typical arm swing motion. Running with one arm restrained increases frontal plane mechanics associated with risk of knee injury.","This paper investigates the impact of unilateral arm swing restriction on lower extremity running mechanics and its implications for injury risk. The study finds that running with one arm restrained alters knee and hip angles and increases factors associated with knee injury risk, contrasting with both typical arm swing and bilateral arm swing conditions."

Taylor, Anh-Dung Nguyen, Janet R. Griffin, Kevin R. Ford","Metatarsal and midfoot injuries are common in American football. Footwear design may influence injury rates by altering plantar foot loading patterns in these regions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cleat design on in-shoe plantar foot loading during a football-specific, resisted pushing task. Twenty competitive football players (age 14.7 ± 1.8 years, height 1.72 ± 0.10 m, and mass 71.8 ± 26.9 kg) completed three trials of pushing a weighted sled at maximal effort in a standard shoe (CLEAT) and artificial turf-specific shoe (TURF), with flexible in-shoe force measuring insoles. Repeated measures ANOVAs identified mean differences in maximum force and relative load under all regions of the foot. Results showed higher forces in the CLEAT under the medial (p < 0.001) and lateral (p = 0.004) midfoot, central (p = 0.007) and lateral (p < 0.001) forefoot, and lesser toes (p = 0.01), but lower forces in the hallux (p = 0.02) compared to the TURF shoe. Additionally, relative loading was higher in the CLEAT under the medial (p < 0.001) and lateral (p = 0.002) midfoot and lateral (p < 0.001) forefoot, but lower in the medial forefoot (p = 0.006) and hallux (p < 0.001) compared to the TURF shoe.

The study subjects were 27 youth soccer players (age 16.77 ± 0.75 years; body mass 63.29 ± 7.37 kg; body height 174.14 ± 8.46 cm) playing in the basic categories of a first division team at the regional level of Brazilian soccer. Each subject was evaluated with the following tests: a) a treadmill test to directly determine values of VO2max and Vamax (Treadmill); b) an indirect Shuttle Run Test (SRT); c) an indirect Carminatti's test (TCar). VO2max showed significantly different values in the Treadmill and the SRT (59.21 ± 5.88 and 50.67 ± 3.58 ml⋅kg-1⋅min-1, respectively). Similarly, values obtained for VPeak in the treadmill test and for Vamax in TCar were different from values for SRT VPeak (15.01 ± 1.10, 14.92 ± 0.87 and 12.64 ± 0.62 km⋅h-1, respectively). A correlation analysis showed a moderate relationship between values for VPeak TCar and VO2max determined on a treadmill (r = 0.46) and Vamax determined on a treadmill (r = 0.54). The analysis also showed a high correlation between values of VO2max determined on the treadmill and VO2max evaluated in the SRT (r = 0.69), as well as VPeak determined in the SRT and VO2max tested on the treadmill (r = 0.71), as well as between VPeak determined in the SRT and VO2max evaluated on the treadmill (r = 0.77). We concluded that the SRT underestimated values of VO2max and Vamax. Additionally, VPeak TCar showed no difference compared to Vamax, although it did show a low correlation with it. In addition the SRT, even with high correlations, did not seem to be a great predictor of aerobic fitness in youth soccer players.","This paper investigates the correlation and comparison between aerobic performance measurements obtained through direct and indirect testing methods in youth soccer players.

Female community-level team sport athletes, split into intervention (n = 8) and comparison groups (n = 10), completed a sidestepping movement assessment prior to and following a 9-week training period, in which kinetic, kinematic and neuromuscular data were collected. The intervention group completed a biomechanically informed training protocol, consisting of plyometric, resistance and balance exercises, adjunct to normal training, for 15–20 min twice a week. Following the 9-week intervention, total activation of the muscles crossing the knee (n = 7) decreased for both the training (∆ −15.02%, d = 0.45) and comparison (∆ −9.68%, d = 0.47) groups. This decrease was accompanied by elevated peak knee valgus (∆ +27.78%, d = −0.36) and internal rotation moments (∆ +37.50%, d = −0.56) in the comparison group, suggesting that female community athletes are at an increased risk of injury after a season of play.

The objective was to analyse the effect of the structural components of ATS football pitches and running speed on the capacity of impact attenuation. A total of 12 athletes were evaluated at three speed conditions (3.33 m/s, 4 m/s and maximum speed) on four different ATS, classifying them by their components (length of fibre, type of in-fill and sub-base). Impact attenuation was significantly higher in ATS3, characterised by longer fibre compared to other ATS with less fibre length. The ATS4 with a higher length fibre and built on compacted granular material proportioned significantly lower values in the maximum peaks of tibia acceleration. Finally, as speed increases, the peak tibia impacts were significantly higher. Longer fibre length and the capacity to accommodate a higher quantity of infill facilitate higher impact attenuation. Equally, a compacted granular sub-base is related to lower magnitude of maximum tibia peaks. Finally, the magnitude of the tibia acceleration peaks is dependent of running speed for all ATS analysed, being higher as speed increases.","This paper investigates the impact of structural components in artificial turf systems (ATS) on impact attenuation for football players at varying running speeds. It highlights that ATS with longer fibre lengths and appropriate infill and sub-base materials provide better impact absorption, while peak tibia impacts increase with higher running speeds."
"Neuroplus biofeedback improves attention, resilience, and injury prevention in elite soccer players",2017-02-21,Wiley,Psychophysiology,"Aiace Rusciano, Giuliano Corradini, Ivilin Stoianov","Performance and injury prevention in elite soccer players are typically investigated from physical-tactical, biomechanical, and metabolic perspectives. However, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, and psychophysiological adaptability or resilience are also fundamental for efficiency and well-being in sports. Based on previous research associating autonomic flexibility with prefrontal cortical control, we designed a novel integrated autonomic biofeedback training method called Neuroplus to improve resilience, visual attention, and injury prevention. Herein, we introduce the method and provide an evaluation of 20 elite soccer players from the Italian Soccer High Division (Serie-A): 10 players trained with Neuroplus and 10 trained with a control treatment. The assessments included psychophysiological stress profiles, a visual search task, and indexes of injury prevention, which were measured pre- and posttreatment. The analysis showed a significant enhancement of physiological adaptability, recovery following stress, visual selective attention, and injury prevention that were specific to the Neuroplus group. Enhancing the interplay between autonomic and cognitive functions through biofeedback may become a key principle for obtaining excellence and well-being in sports. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that shows improvement in visual selective attention following intense autonomic biofeedback.","The paper explores the impact of a novel biofeedback training method, Neuroplus, on attention, resilience, and injury prevention among elite soccer players. The study demonstrates significant improvements in physiological adaptability, recovery from stress, and visual selective attention specifically in players who underwent the Neuroplus training compared to a control group."
Functional Movement Screen Scores and Physical Performance among Youth Elite Soccer Players,2017-02-21,MDPI AG,Sports,"Bruno Silva, Filipe Clemente, Miguel Camões, Pedro Bezerra","This study had two main objectives: (1) to determine if differences in Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores exist between two levels of competition; and (2) to analyze the association between FMS individual and overall scores and physical performance variables of lower-limb power (jumps), repeated sprint ability and shot speed. Twenty-two Under 16 (U16) and twenty-six Under 19 (U19) national competitive soccer players participated in this study. All participants were evaluated according to anthropometrics, FMS, jump performance, instep kick speed and anaerobic performance. There were no significant differences in the individual FMS scores between competitive levels. There were significant negative correlations between hurdle step (right) and Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) power average ( ρ = -0.293; p = 0.043) and RAST fatigue index (RAST FatIndex) ( ρ = -0.340; p = 0.018). The hurdle step (left) had a significant negative correlation to squat jump (SJ) ( ρ = -0.369; p = 0.012). Rotary stability had a significant negative correlation to RAST fatigue index (Right: ρ = -0.311; p = 0.032. Left: ρ = -0.400; p = 0.005). The results suggest that individual FMS scores may be better discriminants of performance than FMS total score and established minimal association between FMS scores and physical variables. Based on that, FMS may be suitable for the purposes of determining physical function but not for discriminating physical performance.","This study examines the relationship between Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores and physical performance in elite youth soccer players across two competitive levels. The findings indicate minimal differences in FMS scores between the levels, with individual FMS scores showing significant negative correlations with lower-limb performance metrics, suggesting FMS is more effective for assessing physical function rather than predicting performance outcomes."
Integrating pre-game rituals and pre-performance routines in a culture-specific context: Implications for sport psychology consultancy,2017-02-20,Informa UK Limited,International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology,"John Elvis Hagan Jnr., Thomas Schack","Common unorthodox pre-game rituals (PGR) are prevalent in sports, especially soccer, in Ghana and other Sub-Saharan states, yet research literature on how to draw valuable insights from these superstitious rituals to optimize sport performance are sparse.

Effect of Aerobic Loading on Static Balance in Young Athletes,2017-02-20,Redfame Publishing,Journal of Education and Training Studies,Öznur Akyüz,"The fact that balances can also be a factor in performance distinction between athletes in athletic skills, and is considered to provide positive acceleration for physical development in which motor skills are exhibited. Human’s skill to ensure balance can be defined as a determinant factor in development of other motor skills. From this point of view, the purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of Aerobic Loading on Proprioception in Young Athletes. The research was composed of 18 young athletes registered in Ağrı Provincial Directorate of Youth and Sports Athletics Club. Tests of the participant athletes of the research were conducted in the Performance Laboratory of Ağrı ibrahim Çeçen University Department of Physical Training and Sports. After the data were collected, comparisons were made using percentage distributions, medians, and t-test. As a result of the research, it was seen that no effect at desired level occurred in static balances of athletes. It was detected that there was no significant difference between the static balance values taken prior to loading and the static balance values taken after loading (p&gt; 0,05). In lactate measurements performed in order to detect fatigue conditions, differences at significant level (p≤0.05) were detected when the data taken before and after the study were compared. When the general characteristics of the participants are considered, the fact that they are elite athletes reminds that they may carry a high level of motor learning process along with them. This skill may be effective in the fact that static balance values remained unchanged following maximal loading.","The paper investigates the impact of aerobic loading on static balance in young athletes, suggesting that while balance is crucial for motor skill development, aerobic loading did not significantly affect static balance outcomes in the studied cohort. However, notable changes in lactate levels indicate varying fatigue conditions, emphasizing the complexity of performance factors in elite young athletes."
A comparison of injuries in elite male and female football players: A five‐season prospective study,2017-02-16,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"J. Larruskain, J. A. Lekue, N. Diaz, A. Odriozola, S. M. Gil","The aim was to compare the epidemiology of injuries between elite male and female football players from the same club. Injuries and individual exposure time in a male team and a female team, both playing in the Spanish first division, were prospectively recorded by the club's medical staff for five seasons (2010-2015) following the FIFA consensus statement. Total, training, and match exposure hours per player-season were 20% higher for men compared to women (P<.01). Total, training, and match injury incidence were 30%-40% higher in men (P≤.04) mainly due to a 4.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30-10.08) times higher incidence of contusions, as there were no differences in the incidence of muscle and joint/ligament injuries (P≥.44). The total number of absence days was 21% larger in women owing to a 5.36 (95% CI 1.11-25.79) times higher incidence of severe knee and ankle ligament injuries. Hamstring strains and pubalgia cases were 1.93 (95% CI 1.16-3.20) and 11.10 (95% CI 1.48-83.44) times more frequent in men, respectively; whereas quadriceps strains, anterior cruciate ligament ruptures, and ankle syndesmosis injuries were 2.25 (95% CI 1.22-4.17), 4.59 (95% CI 0.93-22.76), and 5.36 (95% CI 1.11-25.79) times more common in women, respectively. In conclusion, prevention strategies should be tailored to the needs of male and female football players, with men more predisposed to hamstring strains and hip/groin injuries, and women to quadriceps strains and severe knee and ankle ligament injuries.","This paper investigates the differences in injury epidemiology between elite male and female football players over five seasons in the Spanish first division.

Preventive Biomechanics: A Paradigm Shift With a Translational Approach to Injury Prevention,2017-02-15,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Timothy E. Hewett, Nathaniel A. Bates","Background: Preventive medicine techniques have alleviated billions of dollars’ worth of the economic burden in the medical care system through the implementation of vaccinations and screenings before the onset of disease symptoms. Knowledge of biomechanical tendencies has progressed rapidly over the past 20 years such that clinicians can identify, in healthy athletes, the underlying mechanisms that lead to catastrophic injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. As such, preventive medicine concepts can be applied to noncontact musculoskeletal injuries to reduce the economic burden of sports medicine treatments and enhance the long-term health of athletes. Purpose: To illustrate the practical medical benefits that could be gained from preventive biomechanics applied to the ACL as well as the need and feasibility for the broad implementation of these principles. Study Design: Literature review. Methods: The recent literature pertinent to the screening and prevention of musculoskeletal injuries was reviewed and compiled into a clinical commentary on the current state and applicability of preventive biomechanics. Results: Investigators have identified neuromuscular training protocols that screen for and correct the underlying biomechanical deficits that lead to ACL injuries. The literature shows that when athletes comply with these prescribed training protocols, the incidence of injuries is significantly reduced within that population. Such preventive biomechanics practices employ basic training methods that would be familiar to athletic coaches and have the potential to save billions of dollars in cost in sports medicine. Conclusion: The widespread implementation of preventive biomechanics concepts could profoundly affect the field of sports medicine with a minimum of initial investment.","The paper discusses the application of preventive biomechanics to reduce musculoskeletal injuries, particularly anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures, among athletes. It highlights the effectiveness of neuromuscular training protocols in identifying and correcting biomechanical deficits to significantly decrease injury incidence and the potential economic benefits of these practices in sports medicine."
How Does a Standing Exercise Programme Focusing on Hip-Abduction Strength Affect Anterior Knee Pain in Runners?,2017-02-15,"Scholink Co, Ltd.",Research in Health Science,Laura Schembri,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outline: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anterior Knee Pain (AKP) is the most prevalent injury in running. Growing evidence suggests that hip muscle imbalance plays a role in the development of AKP. Gluteus Medius (GMed) is the main abductor of the hip and also stabilises the pelvis during gait. Studies show that hip-abduction strength is decreased in populations with AKP. This relates to increased hip-adduction, hip internal rotation and knee abduction, which are associated with higher patellofemoral contact pressures. &lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; The main aim of this study is to determine whether a standing exercise programme will improve hip-abductor strength. The second aim of the study is to determine whether there will be a decrease in running-related pain after completing a six-week standing exercise programme. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Within-participant pre-test/post-test comparative trial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Sport’s Clinic at the Malta Football Association. Ta Qali National Stadium (Malta).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main outcome measures: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GMed torque was measured using a Biodex® System 3 isokinetic dynamometer as demonstrated by Brent et al (2013). The Numerical Rating Scale was used to measure pain related to running. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-test torque scores were higher on the affected side. Scores on the affected side improved by 22.81% from a mean baseline average of 96.00Nm/kg to 117.86Nm/kg, (p-value 0.013). Scores on the unaffected side improved by 27.97% from a mean baseline average of 90.14Nm/kg to 115.29Nm/kg (p-value 0.031). Post-test scores were more balanced between limbs. Pain scores decreased from 5.29 as measured on the NRS to 1.00 (p-value 0.000). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standing exercises aimed at strengthening the hip-abductors may prove to be a valid intervention for prevention and rehabilitation of AKP. However, better quality studies are needed in order to validate this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","This study investigates the impact of a standing exercise program focused on hip-abduction strength on anterior knee pain (AKP) in runners.

Differences in the Dominant and Non-Dominant Knee Valgus Angle in Junior Elite and Amateur Soccer Players after Unilateral Landing,2017-02-13,MDPI AG,Sports,"Oliver Ludwig, Steven Simon, Joe Piret, Stephan Becker, Franz Marschall","More than 70% of all knee injuries in soccer occur in non-contact situations. It is known that increased lower limb dynamic knee valgus is associated with such situations. Little has been found out about differences in knee kinematics of the dominant (kicking) and non-dominant (supporting) leg during a single leg landing. A total of 114 male adolescent soccer players (age 14.6 ± 1.1 years) from elite (N = 66) and amateur soccer clubs (N = 48) performed a single leg drop landing down from a box. For each leg, the two-dimensional dynamic knee valgus angle (DKVA) was calculated. Paired t-tests were used to statistically determine significant differences between dominant and non-dominant leg DKVA, and t-tests were calculated between the two performance groups. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were identified for the DKVA between the dominant and non-dominant leg for both amateur and elite players, showing a greater DKVA for the dominant leg. Group differences for the DKVA between amateur and elite players were not found, neither for the dominant, nor for the non-dominant leg. It can be concluded that the non-dominant leg showed more stable dynamics than the dominant leg during unilateral landing regardless of the player's performance level. This could be due to adaptions to sport-specific requirements. Therefore, it is recommended that programs to prevent knee injuries among soccer players consider the dynamics of each leg individually.","The paper investigates the differences in dynamic knee valgus angle (DKVA) between the dominant and non-dominant legs of junior elite and amateur soccer players during unilateral landings. Findings indicate that the non-dominant leg demonstrates more stable dynamics than the dominant leg across both performance groups, highlighting the need for tailored injury prevention programs that account for leg-specific dynamics."

Relationship among repeated sprint ability, chronological age, and puberty in young soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 32(2): 364–371, 2018—The aim of this study was to analyzed the relationship of repeated sprint ability (RSA) with chronological age and puberty in 100 young soccer players (age: 13 ± 3 years–160 ± 33 months-; height: 159 ± 16 cm, mass: 49.7 ± 14.1 kg; body mass index [BMI] 19.2 ± 2.5 kg/m 2 ) grouped on “Pulcini” (9–10 years), “Esordienti” (11–12 years), “Giovanissimi” (13–14 years), “Allievi” (15–16 years), and “Juniores” (&gt;17 years) categories. Anthropometric (weight, height, BMI), RSA (7 × 30 m sprint with 25 seconds active rest: total time—TT, the lowest sprinting time, and the fatigue index percentage—%IF), and development (self-administered rating scale for pubertal development PDS; puberty) parameters were measured. ANOVA among categories was applied to asses differences ( p ≤ 0.05) in TT and %IF. When a significant effect was found, Bonferroni's post hoc analysis was used. Pearson correlation among all variables was calculated considering all subjects and also within categories. Among categories, statistical analysis showed significant differences ( p &lt; 0.001) in TT and a considerable trend toward significance ( p = 0.06) in %IF. Significant correlations among variables were found in all subjects and within categories. In particular, TT showed large significant correlation with PDS ( r = −0.66) and puberty ( r = −0.67) only in “Esordienti.” This study provides useful information for the coach to propose an appropriate training and to obtain the optimal training effect and to minimize the risk of injury and overtraining during the different phases of growth and maturation.","This study investigates the relationship between repeated sprint ability (RSA), chronological age, and puberty in 100 young soccer players across various age categories.

Where biomedicalisation and magic meet: Therapeutic innovations of elite sports injury in British professional football and cycling,2017-02-09,Elsevier BV,Social Science &amp; Medicine,"Alex Faulkner, Michael McNamee, Catherine Coveney, Jonathan Gabe","Injury is a conspicuous feature of the practice and public spectacle of contemporary elite sports. The paper argues that the 'biomedicalisation' thesis (medico-industrial nexus, techno-scientific drivers, medical optimisation, biologisation, the rise of evidence and health surveillance) goes some way to capturing the use in elite sports injury of some highly specialised mainstream therapies and some highly maverick biological therapies, which are described. Nevertheless, these main strands of biomedicalisation do not capture the full range of these phenomena in the contexts of sports medicine and athletes' practices in accessing innovative, controversial therapies. Drawing on multi-method qualitative research on top-level professional football and cycling in the UK, 2014–2016, we argue that concepts of 'magic' and faith-based healing, mediated by notions of networking behaviour and referral systems, furnish a fuller explanation. We touch on the concept of 'medical pluralism', concluding that this should be revised in order to take account of belief-based access to innovative bio-therapies amongst elite sportspeople and organisations.","This paper explores the intersection of biomedical treatments and unconventional therapies in elite sports injury management within British professional football and cycling.

Real-time optimized biofeedback utilizing sport techniques (ROBUST): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,2017-02-07,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Jeffrey B. Taylor, Anh-Dung Nguyen, Mark V. Paterno, Bin Huang, Kevin R. Ford","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female athletes lead to a variety of short- and long-term physical, financial, and psychosocial ramifications. While dedicated injury prevention training programs have shown promise, ACL injury rates remain high as implementation has not become widespread. Conventional prevention programs use a combination of resistance, plyometric, balance and agility training to improve high-risk biomechanics and reduce the risk of injury. While many of these programs focus on reducing knee abduction load and posture during dynamic activity, targeting hip extensor strength and utilization may be more efficacious, as it is theorized to be an underlying mechanism of injury in adolescent female athletes. Biofeedback training may complement traditional preventive training, but has not been widely studied in connection with ACL injuries. We hypothesize that biofeedback may be needed to maximize the effectiveness of neuromuscular prophylactic interventions, and that hip-focused biofeedback will improve lower extremity biomechanics to a larger extent than knee-focused biofeedback during dynamic sport-specific tasks and long-term movement strategies. This is an assessor-blind, randomized control trial of 150 adolescent competitive female (9–19 years) soccer players. Each participant receives 3x/week neuromuscular preventive training and 1x/week biofeedback, the mode depending on their randomization to one of 3 biofeedback groups (hip-focused, knee-focused, sham). The primary aim is to assess the impact of biofeedback training on knee abduction moments (the primary biomechanical predictor of future ACL injury) during double-leg landings, single-leg landings, and unplanned cutting. Testing will occur immediately before the training intervention, immediately after the training intervention, and 6 months after the training intervention to assess the long-term retention of modified biomechanics. Secondary aims will assess performance changes, including hip and core strength, power, and agility, and the extent to which maturation effects biofeedback efficacy. The results of the Real-time Optimized Biofeedback Utilizing Sport Techniques (ROBUST) trial will help complement current preventive training and may lead to clinician-friendly methods of biofeedback to incorporate into widespread training practices.

Epidemiological Patterns of Initial and Subsequent Injuries in Collegiate Football Athletes,2017-02-07,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Jacob Z. Williams, Bhavna Singichetti, Hongmei Li, Henry Xiang, Kevin E. Klingele, Jingzhen Yang","Background: A body of epidemiological studies has examined football injuries and associated risk factors among collegiate athletes. However, few existing studies specifically analyzed injury risk in terms of initial or subsequent injuries. Purpose: To determine athlete-exposures (AEs) and rates of initial and subsequent injury among collegiate football athletes. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiological study. Methods: Injury and exposure data collected from collegiate football players from two Division I universities (2007-2011) were analyzed. Rate of initial injury was calculated as the number of initial injuries divided by the total number of AEs for initial injuries, while the rate for subsequent injury was calculated as the number of subsequent injuries divided by the total number of AEs for subsequent injury. Poisson regression was used to determine injury rate ratio (subsequent vs initial injury), with adjustment for other covariates. Results: The total AEs during the study period were 67,564, resulting in an overall injury rate of 35.2 per 10,000 AEs. Rates for initial and subsequent injuries were 31.7 and 45.3 per 10,000 AEs, respectively, with a rate ratio (RR) of 1.4 for rate of subsequent injury vs rate of initial injury (95% CI, 1.1-1.9). Rate of injury appeared to increase with each successive injury. RR during games was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.0).

For wide receivers, the rate of subsequent injuries was 2.2 times the rate of initial injuries (95% CI, 1.3-3.8), and for defensive linemen, the rate of subsequent injuries was 2.1 times the rate of initial injuries (95% CI, 1.1-3.9). Conclusion: The method used in this study allows for a more accurate determination of injury risk among football players who have already been injured at least once. Further research is warranted to better identify which specific factors contribute to this increased risk for subsequent injury.","The paper investigates the rates of initial and subsequent injuries among collegiate football athletes and analyzes injury risk factors.

LBP can be detrimental to athletic performance and health. Factors predisposing to LBP in athletes remain elusive and require further studies. We investigated whether carriage of a specific genotype and/or allele of vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) was a risk factor for LBP in athletes of different sports disciplines. This genotype/phenotype association case-control study included 60 Italian athletes (25 females and 35 males; mean age 33.9 ± 13.3 years; body-mass-index 23.5 ± 3.5 kg/m2) of which 16.7% were swimmers, 11.7% soccer players, 11.7% volleyball players, 10.0% rugby players and other disciplines. VDR-FokI polymorphism was measured by PCR-RFLP in 24 athletes with LBP and 36 athletes without LBP episodes. Absence or presence of the FokI restriction site was denoted ""F"" and ""f"", respectively. Other risk factors were evaluated by a questionnaire. The homozygous FF genotype was found in 58.3% (14/24) of athletes with LBP versus 27.8% (10/36) of athletes without LBP, adjusted OR = 5.78, 95% CI 1.41–23.8, P = 0.015. The F allele was a 2-fold risk factor to develop LBP, adjusted OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.02–6.43, P = 0.046, while f allele was protective.

The relationship between loading history and proximal femoral diaphysis cross‐sectional geometry,2017-02-05,Wiley,American Journal of Human Biology,"Sirpa Niinimäki, Nathaniel Narra, Laura Härkönen, Shinya Abe, Riku Nikander, Jari Hyttinen, Christopher Knüsel, Harri Sievänen","Abstract Objectives We investigated the relationship between loading history and bone biomechanical properties used in physical activity reconstructions. These bone properties included bone bending and torsional strength ( J ), cortical area (CA), the direction of the major axis (theta angle), and element shape ratios determined from cross sections of standardized bone length. In addition, we explored the applicability of anatomically determined cross sections. Methods Our material consisted of hip and proximal thigh magnetic resonance images of Finnish female athletes ( N = 91) engaged in high‐jump, triple‐jump, endurance running, swimming, power‐lifting, soccer and squash; along with a group of active non‐athlete individuals ( N = 20). We used regression analysis for size‐adjustment, and the extracted residuals were then used to compare differences in the bone properties between groups. Results We found that triple‐jumpers, soccer players, and squash players had the greatest values in CA and J , swimmers and non‐athletes had the smallest, whereas high‐jumpers, power‐lifters, and endurance runners exhibited interim values. No between‐the‐group differences in element shape ratios or theta angles were found. We found that influences of activity were similar regardless of whether standardized length or anatomically determined cross sections were used. Conclusions Extreme (triple‐jump) and directionally inconsistent loading (soccer and squash) necessitate a more robust skeleton compared to directionally consistent loading (high‐jump, power‐lifting, and endurance running) or non‐impact loading (swimming and non‐athletes). However, not all of these relationships were statistically significant. Thus, information gained about physical activity using bone properties is informative but limited. Accounting for the limitations, the method is applicable on fragmented skeletal material as anatomically determined cross sections can be used.","This paper investigates the relationship between loading history and bone biomechanical properties in athletes, particularly focusing on hip and proximal thigh bone characteristics. It examines how different athletic activities, such as high-jump, soccer, and swimming, influence bone geometry, finding that extreme and directionally inconsistent loading demands a more robust skeletal structure, while acknowledging the limitations of the methods used for analysis."
Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Is Associated With Significantly Reduced ACL Graft Rupture Rates at a Minimum Follow-up of 2 Years: A Prospective Comparative Study of 502 Patients From the SANTI Study Group,2017-02-02,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Bertrand Sonnery-Cottet, Adnan Saithna, Maxime Cavalier, Charles Kajetanek, Eduardo Frois Temponi, Matt Daggett, Camilo Partezani Helito, Mathieu Thaunat","Background: Graft failure and low rates of return to sport are major concerns after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, particularly in a population at risk. Purpose: To evaluate the association between reconstruction techniques and subsequent graft rupture and return-to-sport rates in patients aged 16 to 30 years participating in pivoting sports. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A prospective study of patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction with a bone–patellar tendon–bone (B-PT-B) graft, quadrupled hamstring tendon (4HT) graft, or hamstring tendon graft combined with anterolateral ligament reconstruction (HT+ALL) was conducted by the Scientific ACL NeTwork International (SANTI) Study Group. Survivorship data from Kaplan-Meier analysis were analyzed in multivariate Cox regression models to identify the prognosticators of graft ruptures and return to sport. Results: Five hundred two patients (mean age, 22.4 ± 4.0 years) with a mean follow-up of 38.4 ± 8.5 months (range, 24-54 months) were included. There were 105 B-PT-B, 176 4HT, and 221 HT+ALL grafts. The mean postoperative scores at latest follow-up were the following: Lysholm: 92.4 ± 8.6, Tegner: 7.4 ± 2.1, and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC): 86.8 ± 10.5 for B-PT-B grafts; Lysholm: 91.3 ± 9.9, Tegner: 6.6 ± 1.8, and subjective IKDC: 85.4 ± 10.4 for 4HT grafts; and Lysholm: 91.9 ± 10.2, Tegner: 7.0 ± 2.0, and subjective IKDC: 81.8 ± 13.1 for HT+ALL grafts. The mean side-to-side laxity was 0.6 ± 0.9 mm for B-PT-B grafts, 0.6 ± 1.0 mm for 4HT grafts, and 0.5 ± 0.8 mm for HT+ALL grafts. At a mean follow-up of 38.4 months, the graft rupture rates were 10.77% (range, 6.60%-17.32%) for 4HT grafts, 16.77% (range, 9.99%-27.40%) for B-PT-B grafts, and 4.13% (range, 2.17%-7.80%) for HT+ALL grafts. The rate of graft failure with HT+ALL grafts was 2.5 times less than with B-PT-B grafts (hazard ratio [HR], 0.393; 95% CI, 0.153-0.953) and 3.1 times less than with 4HT grafts (HR, 0.327; 95% CI, 0.130-0.758). There was no significant difference in the graft failure rate between 4HT and B-PT-B grafts (HR, 1.204; 95% CI, 0.555-2.663). Other prognosticators of graft failure included age ≤25 years ( P = .012) and a preoperative side-to-side laxity &gt;7 mm ( P = .018). The HT+ALL graft was associated with higher odds of returning to preinjury levels of sport than the 4HT graft (odds ratio [OR], 1.938; 95% CI, 1.174-3.224) but not compared with the B-PT-B graft (OR, 1.460; 95% CI, 0.813-2.613). Conclusion: In a high-risk population of young patients participating in pivoting sports, the rate of graft failure with HT+ALL grafts was 2.5 times less than with B-PT-B grafts and 3.1 times less than with 4HT grafts. The HT+ALL graft is also associated with greater odds of returning to preinjury levels of sport when compared with the 4HT graft.",This study investigates the impact of different ACL reconstruction techniques on graft rupture rates and return-to-sport outcomes in young athletes involved in pivoting sports. The findings indicate that the anterolateral ligament (HT+ALL) reconstruction yields significantly lower graft rupture rates and higher rates of returning to preinjury activity levels compared to traditional graft techniques.
The Athletic Shoe in Football,2017-02-02,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"James Jastifer, Richard Kent, Jeff Crandall, Chris Sherwood, David Lessley, Kirk A. McCullough, Michael J. Coughlin, Robert B. Anderson","Background: Foot and ankle injuries are common in sports, particularly in cleated athletes. Traditionally, the athletic shoe has not been regarded as a piece of protective equipment but rather as a part of the uniform, with a primary focus on performance and subjective feedback measures of comfort. Changes in turf and shoe design have poorly understood implications on the health and safety of players. Evidence Acquisition: A literature search of the MEDLINE and PubMed databases was conducted. Keywords included athletic shoewear, cleated shoe, football shoes, and shoewear, and search parameters were between the years 2000 and 2016. Study Design: Clinical review. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Results: The athletic shoe is an important piece of protective sports equipment. There are several important structural considerations of shoe design, including biomechanical compliance, cleat and turf interaction, and shoe sizing/fit, that affect the way an athlete engages with the playing surface and carry important potential implications regarding player safety if not understood and addressed. Conclusion: Athletic footwear should be considered an integral piece of protective equipment rather than simply an extension of the uniform apparel. More research is needed to define optimal shoe sizing, the effect that design has on mechanical load, and how cleat properties, including pattern and structure, interact with the variety of playing surfaces.","This paper examines the role of athletic shoes in football, emphasizing their crucial function as protective equipment against foot and ankle injuries. It highlights the importance of shoe design factors, such as biomechanical compliance and cleat-turf interaction, and calls for further research to optimize shoe sizing and assess the impact of design on player safety."
No association between static and dynamic postural control and ACL injury risk among female elite handball and football players: a prospective study of 838 players,2017-02-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Kathrin Steffen, Agnethe Nilstad, Tron Krosshaug, Kati Pasanen, Aleksander Killingmo, Roald Bahr","Background Research on balance measures as potential risk factors for ACL injury is limited. Objective To assess whether postural control was associated with an increased risk for ACL injuries in female elite handball and football players. Method Premier league players were tested in the preseason and followed prospectively for ACL injury risk from 2007 through 2015. At baseline, we recorded player demographics, playing experience, ACL and ankle injury history. We measured centre of pressure velocity in single-leg stabilisation tests and reach distances in the Star Excursion Balance Test. To examine the stability of postural control measures over time, we examined their short-term and long-term reproducibility. We generated logistic regression models, 1 for each of the proposed risk factors. Results A total of 55 (6.6%) out of 838 players (age 21±4 years; height 170±6 cm; body mass 66±8 kg) sustained a non-contact ACL injury after baseline testing (1.8±1.8 years). When comparing normalised balance measures between injured and uninjured players in univariate analyses, none of the variables were statistically associated with ACL injury risk. Short-term and long-term reproducibility of the selected variables was poor. Players with a previous ACL injury had a 3-fold higher risk of sustaining a new ACL injury compared with previously uninjured players (OR 2.9, CI 1.4 to 5.7). Conclusions None of postural control measures examined were associated with increased ACL injury risk among female elite handball and football players. Hence, as measured in the current investigation, the variables included cannot be used to predict ACL injury risk.","This paper investigates the association between postural control measures and ACL injury risk in female elite handball and football players through a prospective study involving 838 athletes. The findings indicate that the postural control measures assessed do not predict ACL injury risk, although a previous ACL injury notably increases the risk of sustaining a subsequent injury."
Range of motion of body segments is larger during the maximal instep kick than during the submaximal kick in experienced football players,2017-02-01,Edizioni Minerva Medica,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"Rob Langhout, Igor Tak, Roelof van der Westen, Ton Lenssen","Football players with groin injury refrain from maximal kicking. Previous groin injury is related to decreased hip range of motion (ROM). Information on ROM differences between maximal and submaximal kicking within players is lacking. The first aim of this study is to quantify ROM of body segments during the maximal (MaxK) and submaximal (SubK) instep kick at four key points. The second aim is to study ROM differences of tension arc and movement trajectories between MaxK and SubK.Maximal (100% ball speed) and submaximal (70% ball speed) instep kicks from 15 experienced football players were registered with motion capture. ROM of hip, spine, pelvis and knee segments were determined at four key points. Differences in segmental ROM for the tension arc and movement trajectories between MaxK and SubK were studied. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated.Ball speed was 98.8±9.0 km/h for MaxK and 69.5±7.1 km/h for SubK. Three key points timed similarly (P<0.05) for MaxK and SubK. MaxK shows increased ROM for all segments (P<0.05) but not for hip flexion. MaxK results in enlargement of tension arc and movement trajectories. Spine flexion (ES=3.2) and pelvis posterior tilt (ES=2.2) show the greatest relative increase.Maximal kicking shows larger segmental ROM than submaximal kicking. Enlargement of tension arc and movement trajectories relate to increased segmental velocity, according to biomechanical concepts. Central body actions play an important role in kicking. This information can be used to further identify kicking strategies in athletes with injury.","This paper investigates the differences in range of motion (ROM) of body segments during maximal and submaximal instep kicks in experienced football players. Findings indicate that maximal kicking results in greater ROM across various body segments, particularly in spine flexion and pelvis tilt, which may inform injury management and kicking strategies in athletes."
The Effect of First-Step Techniques from the Staggered Stance in American Football,2017-02-01,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,Sports Medicine International Open,"Nikolas Knudsen, Thomas Andersen","The purpose of this study was to evaluate 3 different starting techniques from the staggered stance with regards to sprint time, reaction time, linear impulse and power. 11 male amateur American football players volunteered to participate in a testing session consisting of twelve 5 m sprints, 4 in each technique (normal (NORM), backwards false step (BFS) and forwards false step (FFS)) in random order. Sprint starts were performed on force plates to investigate ground reaction forces, reaction time and total sprint time. Analysis showed significant differences in sprint times, with NORM (1.77±0.10 s) being faster than FFS (1.81±0.12 s) and BFS (2.01±0.13 s), and FFS being faster than BFS, although no differences were found in reaction time. In terms of mean force and power, NORM (331.1±39.2N, 542.2±72.3W) and FFS (320.8±43.2N, 550.9±81.4W) were significantly larger than BFS (256.9±36.2N, 443.5±61.1W). This indicates that when starting from a staggered stance, the BFS is inferior to the others and should be avoided. However, since the force profiles of the NORM and the FFS were similar, the differences in sprint time could arise from a technique bias towards the NORM start.","This study evaluates the impact of three different starting techniques from a staggered stance on sprint performance in American football players. Key findings indicate that the normal starting technique yields the fastest sprint times and greater force and power outputs compared to the forwards and backwards false steps, suggesting that athletes should favor the normal technique for optimal performance."
PADDED HEADGEAR IN CONTACT FOOTBALL – INERTIA OR MOMENTUM?,2017-02-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Andrew McIntosh, Declan Patton","Background Regarding padded headgear worn in contact football (excluding American football), little has changed in terms of game laws, technical specifications or market supplied models over the last 15 years. Objective Assess the impact performance and potential for padded headgear to protect the head. Design Biomechanical. Impact energy attenuation drop tests with ISO “M” headform onto a rigid flat anvil and linear impactor tests on a Hybrid III head and neck. Setting Australian rules football, rugby union and rugby league. Patients None. Interventions Laboratory testing of eight padded headgear models – six commercial and two prototypes. Main Outcome Measurements The primary study outcome measures include peak headform linear (PLA) and peak angular (PAA) accelerations and the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). Results In centre-front 0.2 m drop tests, PLA values ranged from 367 to 592 g and HIC ranged from 780 to 2064 in commercial models. In contrast a prototype “Hexlid” model produced PLA of 53 g in the same tests and 172 in 0.3 m drop tests. In 4 m/s lateral linear impacts the bare headform PLA was 107 g and PAA 7.1 krad/s 2 . Commercial headgear PLA's ranged from 91 to 100 g and PAA 6.0 to 6.8 krad/s 2 for the same tests. In contrast the “Hexlid” model produced PLA of 65 g and PAA of 4.8 krad/s 2 . PLA in 0.2 m drop tests on commercially available headgear ranged from 251 to 538 g compared to 64 to 483 g in eight models tested under equivalent conditions and available in the late 1990s. Conclusions There is no indication that the commercially available headgear would be effective in reducing concussion risk. The performance of commercially available headgear has not improved since the 1990s. Prototype headgear show how impact performance can be improved. The test methods provide the basis for technical specifications.","This paper assesses the effectiveness of padded headgear in contact football by evaluating the impact performance of various headgear models through laboratory tests. The findings indicate that commercial headgear has not shown improvements in concussion risk reduction over the past 15 years, whereas prototype models demonstrate enhanced protective performance, laying the groundwork for future technical specifications."
"SIDE- AND AGE-SPECIFIC POSTURAL ADAPTATIONS OF MALE ELITE JUNIOR SOCCER PLAYERS (UNDER 16, 17 &amp; 19)",2017-02-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Karen Hajduk, Dietmar Schmidtbleicher","<h3>Background</h3> Playing soccer at professional level may induce functional and structural adaptations of the neuro-musculoskeletal system based on soccer specific movement coordination due to continuous asymmetrical loadings. This may predispose young athletes in particular to pathologic conditions and increased injury risk at early stages within their careers. <h3>Objective</h3> The purpose was to quantify the static standing profile. It was hypothesized that the alignment differs between limbs (footedness) and age groups. <h3>Design</h3> Experimental, prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanical assessment in clinical practice. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> 102 uninjured male elite junior soccer players aged between 16 and 19 years old reporting no former joint injury. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Three-dimensional motion capture (SIMI Motion 3D) analysing the static standing profile. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> 3D kinematic data of the thoracic (TH 12) and lumbar spine (L3), pelvis and hips, knees and ankles bilateral, comprising 27 variables. <h3>Results</h3> Kinematic data indicate age-specific differences for the amount of thoracic extension, knee adduction and external rotation of the supporting leg (p&lt;0.05). Side-specific adaptations can be proven for functional scoliosis at the thoracolumbar junction and height of iliac crest (p&lt;0.05). K-means analyses show significant differences for hip abduction and external rotation for the kicking leg (p&lt;0.05). By means of correspondence analysis U19 players can be associated with lumbar scoliosis, knee varus for the supporting leg and knee valgus for the kicking leg. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The older the players, the more complex the functional postural adaptations. The results provide plausible explanations for increased injury risk of ACL injuries on the kicking leg, groin pain, and the need for more sophisticated injury prevention programs. From a methodological point of view, comprehensive 3D-static analysis using appropriate statistical analyses seems to be well suited for the assessment of postural deviations for large scale cohorts.","This paper investigates postural adaptations in male elite junior soccer players aged 16 to 19, focusing on the differences in static standing profiles related to age and footedness. The results reveal significant age-specific and side-specific postural variations that may contribute to an increased injury risk, particularly for ACL injuries and groin pain, underscoring the importance of tailored injury prevention strategies."
THE EFFECT OF FUNCTIONAL FATIGUE ON KNEE FORCE SENSE IN UNINJURED ADULT MALE FOOTBALL PLAYERS,2017-02-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Nicholas Clark, Mark Rolleston","Background Intact proprioception (joint position sense (JPS), kinaesthesia, force sense (FS)) is critical for optimal neuromuscular control of knee functional joint stability. Fatigue is known to impair knee JPS and kinaesthesia, but research regarding the effect of fatigue on knee FS is lacking. Objective To determine the effect of functional fatigue on knee extension FS in uninjured, adult, male football players. It was hypothesized that functional fatigue would result in significant impairment of FS. Design Single-session, pre-/post-intervention repeated measures. Setting University sensorimotor control and biomechanics laboratory. Participants University team players (n=21; age (mean±SD) 21.0±1.2 years; height 178.7±7.2 cm; mass 76.8±11.5 kg; training×2/week; match×1/week) without history of knee intra-articular derangement or surgery. Interventions Functional fatigue was defined/induced using the previously published Functional Agility Short-Term Fatigue Protocol (FAST-FP). The FAST-FP incorporated acceleration-deceleration tasks typical of football training/match play. Main Outcome Measures Dominant leg (preferred kicking leg) knee extension FS was measured in Newtons (N). Players were seated on an isokinetic dynamometer set to isometric mode, the knee flexed 45°. A knee extension target trial-reproduction trial sequence was repeated five times, the difference between trials designated the absolute error (AE), the average AE used for data analyses. Reliability and measurement error for this procedure has been previously established. Force sense measurements were performed before and immediately after the FAST-FP. The FS and FAST-FP procedures were adjacent in the same laboratory space with minimal transition time between tasks. Results Force sense AE significantly increased following fatigue (pre-fatigue=10.9±5.8 N; post-fatigue=23.0±9.2 N; difference=12.1±7.9 N; P=0.00; d=1.59). Conclusions Dominant leg knee extension FS was significantly impaired following functional fatigue. Fatigue-induced impairment of FS could result in sub-optimal neuromuscular control and altered knee functional joint stability that affects knee injury risk.","This paper investigates how functional fatigue impacts knee force sense (FS) in uninjured adult male football players, hypothesizing that fatigue would impair FS. The results indicate a significant increase in the absolute error of FS after fatigue, suggesting that fatigue may negatively influence neuromuscular control and potentially increase knee injury risk."

Previous studies have examined its efficacy in reducing injuries, however no information is available on whether it changes targeted movement patterns. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in peak knee abduction moment (PKAM) over two soccer seasons using the FIFA11+. We hypothesized that athletes will have decreased PKAM over the first season, no changes in the off-season, and further decreases over the second season. Design Prospective non-randomized intervention study (control team data currently being collected). Setting Elite collegiate women's soccer. Patients (or Participants) First season N=83, off-season N=68, second season N=59. Interventions The FIFA11+ program was initiated during the preseason and completed throughout two consecutive soccer seasons as a warm-up prior to training sessions and games at least 3x/week. Researchers did not influence the training during the off-season. Main Outcome Measurements PKAM measured during motion analysis of a drop jump at pre- and postseason of two consecutive seasons. Repeated measures ANCOVAs were used to analyse the change over each season and the off-season, with baseline PKAM included in each model as a covariate. Results There was a significant main effect of time over the first season (preseason 0.24±0.01, postseason 0.23±0.01, p=0.02). PKAM was a significant covariate (p&lt;0.01). There no main effect of time over the off-season (p=0.40), however, PKAM was a significant covariate (p&lt;0.01). There was also no main effect of time over the second season (p=0.29), with PKAM again a significant covariate (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions The FIFA11+ is effective in preventing injuries, however its mechanism is unknown. The preliminary results of this study indicate this injury reduction may not be occurring as a result of a decrease in PKAM in all athletes.","The paper investigates the impact of the FIFA11+ injury prevention program on peak knee abduction moment (PKAM) in elite collegiate women's soccer players over two seasons. It finds that while the FIFA11+ program is effective in reducing injuries, changes in PKAM do not appear to correlate with this injury reduction, indicating that mechanisms behind the efficacy of the program remain unclear."
INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL MONITORING FOR ELITE WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS: AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME,2017-02-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Stephen Boyce, Oliver Davies, Michael McKenna, Andrew White, Mark Dixon, Niall Elliott","Background Education of soccer players is important in injury prevention and maintaining health throughout their career. Injury epidemiological studies have highlighted risk around knee and ankle. Aetiological factors include direct trauma, biomechanical imbalances, poor mobility, strength imbalances and training load. Objective To monitor individual player specific physical range of movement scores to inform and educate players around self-management, readiness to train and injury risk. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Scotland women's soccer national squad. Participants Elite women international soccer players. Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors) Players were assessed each morning during international team camps for a range of objective physical markers. Main Outcome Measurements Sit and reach distance, Knee to wall distance, Thomas test hip range of movement. Average scores were used to educate players and individually tasked with completing specific self-management modalities to improve these scores before entering a risk environment. Results 28 players completed the self-directed objective tests. The physical markers were averaged out and players given individual red, amber and green scores. The markers were discussed amongst the sports medicine team and concerns regarding a player's health and fitness relayed to the coaching staff. The player was tasked with completing self-directed individualised exercises to improve any flagged scores. They were also tasked with completing this in their club environment and improvement in physical markers scores was noted on subsequent camp entries. Conclusions Using specific physical markers individual to each player we were able to track and inform of any flagged scores during the health check. This enabled us to give a clear understanding of player readiness to train as well as informing and educating the player on how they could improve their scores through self-management modalities therefore decreasing injury risk. Initial findings through injury surveillance suggest a decrease in lower limb muscle related injuries.","This paper discusses an educational program designed to monitor and improve the physical readiness of elite women's international soccer players, focusing on injury prevention and self-management. By assessing individual physical markers such as range of movement and providing personalized feedback, the program aims to enhance player health and potentially reduce the incidence of lower limb injuries."
Higher Drop in Speed during a Repeated Sprint Test in Soccer Players Reporting Former Hamstring Strain Injury,2017-01-27,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Ola D. Røksund, Morten Kristoffersen, Bård E. Bogen, Alexander Wisnes, Merete S. Engeseth, Ann-Kristin Nilsen, Vegard V. Iversen, Silje Mæland, Hilde Gundersen","Aim: Hamstring strain injury is common in soccer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical capacity of players who have and have not suffered from hamstring strain injury in a sample of semi-professional and professional Norwegian soccer players in order to evaluate characteristics and to identify possible indications of insufficient rehabilitation. Method: Seventy-five semi-professional and professional soccer players (19 ± 3 years) playing at the second and third level in the Norwegian league participated in the study. All players answered a questionnaire, including one question about hamstring strain injury (yes/no) during the previous 2 years. They also performed a 40 m maximal sprint test, a repeated sprint test (8 × 20 m), a countermovement jump, a maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) test, strength tests and flexibility tests. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences in the physical capacity of the players who had suffered from hamstring strain injury and those who had not. Mixed between-within subject's analyses of variance was used to compare changes in speed during the repeated sprint test between groups. Results: Players who reported hamstring strain injury during the previous two years (16%) had a significantly higher drop in speed (0.07 vs. 0.02 s, p = 0.007) during the repeated sprint test, compared to players reporting no previous hamstring strain injury. In addition, there was a significant interaction (groups × time) (F = 3.22, p = 0.002), showing that speed in the two groups changed differently during the repeated sprint test. There were no significant differences in relations to age, weight, height, body fat, linear speed, countermovement jump height, leg strength, VO2max, or hamstring flexibility between the groups. Conclusion: Soccer players who reported hamstring strain injury during the previous 2 years showed significant higher drop in speed during the repeated sprint test compared to players with no hamstring strain injury. The maximal speed, leg strength, ability to produce maximal power, endurance capacity, and hamstring flexibility was similar for both groups. Thus, a repeated sprint test consisting of 8 × 20 m could be used as a field-based diagnostic tool to identify players in need of reconditioning programs to ensure complete post-injury rehabilitation.","This paper examines the differences in physical capacity between soccer players with and without a history of hamstring strain injuries, focusing on their performance during repeated sprint tests. Findings indicate that players with previous injuries exhibited a greater drop in sprint speed, suggesting that the repeated sprint test could serve as an effective diagnostic tool for assessing players' rehabilitation needs."
The late swing and early stance of sprinting are most hazardous for hamstring injuries,2017-01-26,Elsevier BV,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Yu Liu, Yuliang Sun, Wenfei Zhu, Jiabin Yu","Hamstring strain injury is one of most prevalent noncontact injuries in sports that involve high-speed running, such as sprinting, soccer, and rugby. 1 In order to optimize prevention strategies and injury rehabilitation, studies have been conducted to understand hamstring function during sprinting. 2-4However, differences have long existed in the literature as to the cause of hamstring strain injuries.One of the most controversial topics is the debate over which phase of high-speed running is most associated with hamstring injuries. 5tudies of running biomechanics indicate that the hamstrings are active for the entire gait cycle, with peaks in activation during the early stance and the late swing phases. 6,7Mann and Sprague 3 reported that the highest torques of hip extension and knee flexion occur secondary to a peak value of the ground reaction forces (GRFs) during the initial stance phase.Based on this information, they concluded that the early stance was highly associated with hamstring strains.7][8][9] These studies found that the hamstrings contract forcefully while reaching maximum length during the late swing phase.They ignored Mann's argument of high torques as an indicator of hamstring injury risk and preferred the hypothesis that hamstring strains occur during eccentric contractions. 10owever, most previous observers used treadmill sprinting rather than overground sprinting in their studies. 6,8,9Although the treadmill is a convenient tool for assessment of running biomechanics, it has been shown that the biomechanics of treadmill running differ significantly from those of overground running, and thus may lead to erroneous conclusions about overground running. 11,12Additionally, much of the previous research was aimed at investigating the kinematics of the ham-","This paper investigates the phases of sprinting that pose the highest risk for hamstring strain injuries, specifically highlighting the late swing and early stance phases.

Timing Effect on Training-Session Rating of Perceived Exertion in Top-Class Soccer Referees,2017-01-25,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Carlo Castagna, Mario Bizzini, Susana Cristina Araújo Póvoas, Stefano D’Ottavio","To examine the effect of recall timing on training-session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) in a population of athletes well familiarized with the method and procedures during a 5-d training microcycle.Fifty-one top-class field referees (FRs) (age 38.4 ± 3.3 y, height 181 ± 5.6 cm, body mass 76.8 ± 6.8 kg, body-mass index 23.4 ± 1.7 kg/m2, body fat 20.4% ± 3.6%, international refereeing experience 5 ± 3.5 y) from 43 national football associations worldwide, preselected by the FIFA refereeing department for officiating during the FIFA World Cup 2014 Brazil, volunteered for this study. The FRs were randomly allocated into 3 assessment groups (n = 17 each), defined according to the timing of the sRPE, ie, immediately at the end of or 30 min or 7 h after the training sessions' end. The CR10 Borg scale was used to rate the training sessions (n = 5). All FRs again rated each training session of the 5-d training microcycle on the next morning (~20 h after) for confirmation (absolute and relative reliability).No significant timing effect was found between or within groups. Relative reliability ranged from large to very large with trivial within- and between-groups differences.This study showed no effect of recall timing on postexercise RPE when well-familiarized athletes are submitted to training during a weekly microcycle. Posttraining RPE was reported to be a reliable subjective measure; however, specific timing is advisable to reduce difference in RPE values.","This paper investigates the impact of timing on the training-session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) among top-class soccer referees during a 5-day training microcycle. The findings indicate that there is no significant effect of recall timing on post-exercise RPE in well-familiarized athletes, although the measure proved to be reliable, suggesting that specific timing may help minimize variations in RPE values."
Acute Effects of Static Stretching of Hamstring on Performance and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk During Stop-Jump and Cutting Tasks in Female Athletes,2017-01-18,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Mianfang Ruan, Qiang Zhang, Xie Wu","Ruan, M, Zhang, Q, and Wu, X. Acute effects of static stretching of hamstring on performance and anterior cruciate ligament injury risk during stop-jump and cutting tasks in female athletes. J Strength Cond Res 31(5): 1241-1250, 2017-There is limited research investigating antagonist stretch. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of static stretching of hamstrings (SSH) on performance and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk during stop-jump and 180° cutting tasks. Twelve female college athletes (age 20.8 ± 0.7 years; height 1.61 ± 0.05 m; mass 54.25 ± 4.22 kg) participated in this study. Subjects performed stop-jump and 180° cutting tasks under 2 conditions: after warm-up with 4 × 30 seconds SSH or after warm-up without SSH. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data as well as electromyography of biceps femoris, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and gastrocnemius medialis were collected during testing. Static stretching of hamstrings significantly enhanced jump height by 5.1% (p = 0.009) but did not change the takeoff speed of cutting. No significant changes in peak knee adduction moment or peak anterior tibia shear force were observed with SSH regardless of the task. The peak lateral tibia shear force during cutting was significantly (p = 0.036) reduced with SSH. The co-contraction of hamstring and quadriceps during the preactivation (stop-jump: p = 0.04; cutting: p = 0.05) and downward phases (stop-jump: p = 0.04; cutting: p = 0.05) was significantly reduced after SSH regardless of the task. The results suggest that SSH enhanced the performance of stop-jump because of decreased co-contraction of hamstring and quadriceps but did not change the performance of cutting. In addition, SSH did not increase ACL injury risk during stop-jump and cutting tasks and even reduced medial-lateral knee loading during cutting.","This study investigates the acute effects of static stretching of the hamstrings on performance and the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in female athletes during stop-jump and cutting tasks. The findings indicate that static stretching improved jump height without increasing ACL injury risk and reduced knee loading during cutting, while also decreasing co-contraction of key muscle groups involved."
Can a manager dope? Match analysis in the digital age,2017-01-15,SAGE Publications,International Review for the Sociology of Sport,George N Kioussis,"In his influential book on the evolution of sport, historian Allen Guttmann highlights quantification as a key characteristic of the modern era. Though football has long been believed to be too fluid for statistical analysis, the recent proliferation of performance metrics has challenged traditional ways of understanding the game. This has been spurred in large part by the design of ‘smart’ technologies that offer insights into a side’s positional tendencies or physical capacities. Hence, an endeavour that typically rested on the intellect of a manager has now shifted, in some sense, to the computer. This paper connects match analysis systems to the scholarly discourse on performance enhancement and two prominent issue areas related to doping: the ethos of sport and harm.","The paper explores the evolution of match analysis in football, highlighting how the rise of performance metrics and smart technologies is transforming traditional managerial roles and decision-making. It connects these advancements to broader discussions on performance enhancement, the ethos of sport, and the implications of doping."
Effectiveness of an Individualized Training Based on Force-Velocity Profiling during Jumping,2017-01-08,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Pedro Jiménez-Reyes, Pierre Samozino, Matt Brughelli, Jean-Benoît Morin","Ballistic performances are determined by both the maximal lower limb power output (Pmax) and their individual force-velocity (F-v) mechanical profile, especially the F-v imbalance (FVimb): difference between the athlete's actual and optimal profile. An optimized training should aim to increase Pmax and/or reduce FVimb. The aim of this study was to test whether an individualized training program based on the individual F-v profile would decrease subjects' individual FVimb and in turn improve vertical jump performance. FVimb was used as the reference to assign participants to different training intervention groups. 84 subjects were assigned to three groups: an ""optimized"" group divided into velocity-deficit, force-deficit and well-balanced sub-groups based on subjects' FVimb, a ""non-optimized"" group for which the training program was not specifically based on FVimb and a control group. All subjects underwent a 9-week specific resistance training program. The programs were designed to reduce FVimb for the optimized groups (with specific programs for sub-groups based on individual FVimb values), while the non-optimized group followed a classical program exactly similar for all subjects. All subjects in the three optimized training sub-groups (velocity-deficit, force-deficit and well-balanced) increased their jumping performance (12.7±5.7% ES= 0.93±0.09, 14.2±7.3% ES= 1.00±0.17, and 7.2±4.5% ES= 0.70±0.36 respectively) with jump height improvement for all subjects, whereas the results were much more variable and unclear in the non-optimized group. This greater change in jump height was associated with a markedly reduced FVimb for both force-deficit (57.9±34.7% decrease in FVimb) and velocity-deficit (20.1±4.3%) subjects, and unclear or small changes in Pmax (-0.40±8.4% and +10.5±5.2%, respectively). An individualized training program specifically based on FVimb (gap between the actual and optimal F-v profiles of each individual) was more efficient at improving jumping performance (i.e. unloaded squat jump height) than a traditional resistance training common to all subjects regardless of their FVimb. Although improving both FVimb and Pmax has to be considered to improve ballistic performance, the present results showed that reducing FVimb without even increasing Pmax lead to clearly beneficial jump performance changes. Thus, FVimb could be considered as a potentially useful variable for prescribing optimal resistance training to improve ballistic performance.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of an individualized training program based on athletes' force-velocity (F-v) profiles to improve vertical jump performance. Findings reveal that participants in the optimized training groups, which specifically targeted their F-v imbalances (FVimb), achieved significant improvements in jump height compared to the non-optimized group, suggesting that reducing FVimb can enhance ballistic performance without necessarily increasing maximal power output (Pmax)."
"Descriptive Characteristics of Concussions in National Football League Games, 2010-2011 to 2013-2014",2017-01-05,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Michael D. Clark, Breton M. Asken, Stephen W. Marshall, Kevin M. Guskiewicz","Background: Despite a high reported incidence rate of concussion, little is known about the on-field characteristics of injurious head impacts in National Football League (NFL) games. Purpose: To characterize on-field features (location, player position, and time during game) and biomechanical features (anticipation status, closing distance, impact location and type) associated with concussions in NFL games over a 4-season period (2010-2011 to 2013-2014). Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: We analyzed video of a subset of reported, in-game concussions for the 2010-2011 to 2013-2014 seasons. These videos represented a sample of injuries that were diagnosed and reported on the same day and that could be clearly associated with an in-game collision as captured on video. We determined anticipation status, closing distance, impact location on the injured player’s helmet, and impact type (helmet-to-helmet, helmet-to-body, or helmet-to-ground). Associations between these variables were analyzed by use of descriptive statistics and tests of association. Results: A total of 871 diagnosed concussions were reported as occurring during NFL preseason, regular season, and postseason games for the 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 seasons. A total of 1324 games were played during this period, giving a concussion incidence rate of 0.658 per game (95% CI, 0.61-0.70). From the video-reviewed subset (n = 429; 49.3%), the majority of injurious impacts occurred with good anticipation (57.3%) and &lt;10 yards of closing distance (59.0%). An association was found between anticipation status and play type ([Formula: see text] = 27.398, P &lt; .001), largely because injuries occurring on pass plays were more likely to be poorly anticipated than injuries during run plays (43.0% vs 21.4%; [Formula: see text] = 14.78, P &lt; .001). Kick returns had the greatest proportion of well-anticipated impacts (78%) and the greatest proportion of impacts with ≥10 yards of closing distance (80%). The type of impact was approximately equally divided between helmet-to-helmet, helmet-to-body, and helmet-to-ground types. The impact location was broadly distributed over the helmet of the injured player. Conclusion: In-game concussions in the NFL occurred through a diverse variety of mechanisms, surprisingly tended to be well-anticipated, and, also surprisingly, occurred with &lt;10 yards of closing distance. The impacts causing concussion were broadly distributed over the helmet. More concussions occurred during the second half of game play, but we do not have evidence to explain this finding.","The paper investigates the on-field characteristics and biomechanical features associated with concussions in NFL games over four seasons, focusing on factors such as player position, impact location, and type of collision. It finds that despite a high incidence rate of concussions, they often occurred with good anticipation and a closing distance of less than 10 yards, revealing diverse mechanisms behind these injuries."
The influence of football shoe characteristics on athletic performance and injury risk – a review,2017-01-02,Informa UK Limited,Footwear Science,"Daniel Joachim Kulessa, Albert Gollhofer, Dominic Gehring","Background: Footwear is the most relevant tool of a footballer's gear and has to cope with the individual sport-specific demands of the athlete. The challenge in the development of a football shoe is to fine-tune its functional parameters to meet criteria of injury prevention and performance enhancement. There exists a contradiction between those two set-targets that needs to be addressed.Objective: The objective of the review is to provide a literature survey about the scientific knowledge on how football shoe characteristics influence performance and injury risk. Almost 100 scientific publications are included in a qualitative synthesis.Results: The outsole configuration and its influence on traction can be regarded as the most studied functional shoe parameter and has been scientifically proven to affect the player's performance in translational locomotion and the injury risk in rotational movements. The second main aspect consists of the interaction between shoe and ball, which can be divided into the influence of shoe construction on kicking velocity, accuracy and ball control. Footwear properties, such as bending and torsional stiffness, cushioning and comfort, have barely been studied, if at all.Conclusion: The present literature survey shows a substantial influence of football footwear on the athlete. Currently available literature suggests that outsole design influences shoe–surface interaction, which has implications regarding performance and injury risk. Additionally, shoe upper seems to play a crucial role with regard to the performance in ball interactions. However, further research is needed on shoe–foot interactions and on footwear requirements for female, adolescent and indoor players.","This paper reviews how the characteristics of football shoes impact athletic performance and injury risk, highlighting the balance between performance enhancement and injury prevention. It synthesizes findings from nearly 100 studies, emphasizing that outsole configuration significantly affects traction, performance in locomotion, and injury risk, while calling for further investigation into footwear properties and interactions relevant to different player demographics."
Automated Assessment of Dynamic Knee Valgus and Risk of Knee Injury During the Single Leg Squat,2017-01-01,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,"Rezvan Kianifar, Alexander Lee, Sachin Raina, Dana Kulic","Many clinical assessment protocols of the lower limb rely on the evaluation of functional movement tests such as the single leg squat (SLS), which are often assessed visually. Visual assessment is subjective and depends on the experience of the clinician. In this paper, an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based method for automated assessment of squat quality is proposed to provide clinicians with a quantitative measure of SLS performance. A set of three IMUs was used to estimate the joint angles, velocities, and accelerations of the squatting leg. Statistical time domain features were generated from these measurements. The most informative features were used for classifier training. A data set of SLS performed by healthy participants was collected and labeled by three expert clinical raters using two different labeling criteria: ""observed amount of knee valgus""and ""overall risk of injury"". The results showed that both flexion at the hip and knee, as well as hip and ankle internal rotation are discriminative features, and that participants with ""poor""squats bend the hip and knee less than those with better squat performance. Furthermore, improved classification performance is achieved for females by training separate classifiers stratified by gender. Classification results showed excellent accuracy, 95.7 % for classifying squat quality as ""poor""or ""good""and 94.6% for differentiating between high and no risk of injury.","This paper presents an IMU-based method for the automated assessment of knee valgus and the associated risk of injury during single leg squats (SLS). It highlights the effectiveness of using inertial measurement units to provide objective, quantitative evaluations of squat performance, achieving high classification accuracy in distinguishing between poor and good squat quality and assessing injury risk, particularly through gender-specific models."
"The Relationship Between 2-Dimensional Knee-Valgus Angles During Single-Leg Squat, Single-Leg-Land, and Drop-Jump Screening Tests",2017-01-01,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Allan Munro, Lee Herrington, Paul Comfort","Context: Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are a significant problem in female athletes. A number of screening tasks have been used in the literature to identify those at greatest risk of injury. To date, no study has examined the relationship in 2-dimensional (2D) knee valgus between common screening tasks to determine whether individuals exhibit similar movement patterns across tasks. Objective: To establish whether frontal-plane projection angle (FPPA) during the single-leg squat (SLS), single-leg land (SLL), and drop jump (DJ) are related. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: 52 national-league female football players and 36 national-league female basketball players. Main Outcome Measures: 2D FPPA during the SLS, SLL, and DJ screening tasks. Results: Significant correlations were found between tasks. FPPA in the SLS was significantly correlated with SLL ( r = .52) and DJ ( r = .30), whereas FPPA in the SLL was also significantly correlated to DJ ( r = .33). FPPA was significantly greater in the SLS than in the SLL ( P &lt; .001) and DJ ( P &lt; .001) and in the SLL than in the DJ ( P &lt; .001). Conclusion: The results showed that 2D FPPA is correlated across the SLS, SLL, and DJ tasks. However, significantly greater FPPA values in the unilateral tasks suggest that the DJ may not identify risk of injury in sports where primary injury mechanisms are during unilateral loading tasks. Therefore, it is recommended that both unilateral and bilateral tasks be included when screening for ACL and PFJ injury risk.","This study investigates the relationship between 2-dimensional frontal-plane projection angles (FPPA) during single-leg squat, single-leg land, and drop jump tasks in female athletes to assess injury risk, particularly for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and patellofemoral joint (PFJ) injuries. The findings reveal significant correlations in FPPA across the tasks, with higher values observed in unilateral tasks, suggesting the need for a combination of both unilateral and bilateral screening methods for better injury risk assessment."
Gaze control during interceptive actions with different spatiotemporal demands.,2017-01-01,American Psychological Association (APA),Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,"José A. Navia, Matt Dicks, John van der Kamp, Luis M. Ruiz","It is widely accepted that the sources of information used to guide interceptive actions depend on conflicting spatiotemporal task demands.However, there is a paucity of evidence that shows how information pick-up during interceptive actions is adapted to such conflicting constraints.The present study therefore examined the effects of systematic manipulations of spatiotemporal constraints on performance, timing and gaze in an in situ interceptive action.To this end, expert futsal goalkeepers faced penalty kicks taken from 10 m and 6 m.With the more lenient spatiotemporal constraints (i.e., kicks from 10 m), the goalkeepers saved more kicks, initiated their actions later, and looked longer toward ball relative to the penalty takers' body.Furthermore, analysis of gaze patterns showed that interindividual variations in information pick-up were related to the unfolding of the penalty taker's action, revealing a less variable, funnel-like gaze pattern toward the end of the action.These findings are interpreted to reflect that changes in spatiotemporal demands induce the differential use of information for the accurate control of interceptive actions. Public Significance StatementWhen facing penalty kicks, expert goalkeepers can ensure that they dive to the correct goal location if they wait until ball flight.However, in doing so, goalkeepers are likely to move too late for ball interception.Alternatively, goalkeepers can move early and anticipate based on the actions of the penalty taker.We examined how elite futsal goalkeepers adapt to these conflicting spatiotemporal demands by examining their attempts to save penalty kicks taken from 10 m and 6 m.Goalkeepers prioritized moving early to arrive in sufficient time to intercept the ball, although such action coincided with a decrease in anticipation accuracy during 6-m compared to 10-m kicks.These findings are important for the study of perception and action during social coordination (as exemplified by 2 opponents in sport situations) as the use of video or virtual reality (VR)technologies in research fail to safeguard the temporal nature of real-time interactions.","The paper investigates how elite futsal goalkeepers adapt their gaze and timing in response to varying spatiotemporal constraints while saving penalty kicks from different distances. Findings suggest that goalkeepers prioritize early movement to intercept the ball, although this can reduce anticipation accuracy under increased demands."
Do athletes alter their running mechanics after an Achilles tendon rupture?,2017-01-01,Wiley,Journal of Foot and Ankle Research,"Daniel Jandacka, Julia Freedman Silvernail, Jaroslav Uchytil, David Zahradnik, Roman Farana, Joseph Hamill","Abstract Background Over the past thirty years, there has been dramatic increase in incidence of Achilles tendon rupture in the athletic population. The purpose of this study was to compare the lower extremity mechanics of Achilles tendon ruptured runners with healthy controls. Methods The participants with a past history of an Achilles tendon repair ( n = 11) and healthy control ( n = 11) subgroups were matched on sex, age, type of regular physical activity, mass, height, footfall pattern and lateral dominancy. Running kinetics and kinematics of the ankle, knee and hip were recorded using a high‐speed motion capture system interfaced with a force platform. Achilles tendon length was measured using ultrasonography. Main outcome measures were lower extremity joint angles and moments during stance phase of running and Achilles tendon lengths. Results Athletes from Achilles tendon group had an affected gastro‐soleus complex. Athletes with history of Achilles tendon rupture had reduced ankle range of motion during second half of the stance phase of running (Δ7.6°), an overextended knee during initial contact (Δ5.2°) and increased affected knee range of motion (Δ4.4°) during the first half of stance phase on their affected limb compared to the healthy control group. There was a 22% increase in the maximal hip joint moment on contralateral side of the Achilles tendon group compared to the healthy controls. Conclusion These results suggest a compensation mechanism, relatively extended knee at initial ground contact against the deficit in the muscle‐tendon complex of the triceps surae. Overextension during sporting activities may place the knee at risk for further injury. Avoidance of AT lengthening and plantarflexion strength deficit after surgery and during rehabilitation might help to manage AT rupture since these factors may be responsible for altered running kinematics.","This study investigates how athletes change their running mechanics following an Achilles tendon rupture, specifically comparing the lower extremity mechanics of those with a history of tendon repair to healthy controls. Key findings indicate altered joint angles and moments, such as reduced ankle range of motion and overextended knee positions at initial contact, suggesting compensatory strategies that may increase the risk of further injury during running."

Effects of Two Fatigue Protocols on Impact Forces and Lower Extremity Kinematics during Drop Landings: Implications for Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,2017-01-01,Wiley,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,"Rui Xia, Xini Zhang, Xi Wang, Xiaole Sun, Weijie Fu","The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of fatigue on the impact forces and sagittal plane kinematics of the lower extremities in a drop landing task. 15 male collegiate athletes were recruited. Five successful trials of a drop landing task were obtained during prefatigue and postfatigue in two fatigue protocols (constant speed running fatigue protocol [R-FP] and shuttle running + vertical jumping fatigue protocol [SV-FP]). Duration time, maximal heart rate, and RPE of each protocol were measured separately. Kinematic measures of the hip, knee, and ankle joints at different times coupled with peak impact force and loading rate were acquired. Our results showed a more flexed landing posture due to an increase in hip and knee flexion angles in the postfatigue condition. However, no differences in peak impact force and loading rate were found between pre- and postfatigue conditions. The changes were similar between protocols, but the SV-FP showed a significantly shorter exercise duration time than the R-FP. Fatigued athletes in this study demonstrated altered motor control strategies during a drop landing task, which may be an intentional or unintentional protective strategy for preventing themselves from potential ACL injury.","This study investigates the impact of two different fatigue protocols on lower extremity kinematics and impact forces during drop landings among collegiate athletes. Key findings indicate that fatigue results in a more flexed landing posture, suggesting altered motor control strategies that may be protective against noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries, despite no significant changes in peak impact force between pre- and postfatigue conditions."

To review the influence of cleats-surface interaction on the performance and risk of injury in soccer athletes. Design . Systematic review. Data Sources . Scopus, Web of science, PubMed, and B-on. Eligibility Criteria . Full experimental and original papers, written in English that studied the influence of soccer cleats on sports performance and injury risk in artificial or natural grass. Results . Twenty-three articles were included in this review: nine related to performance and fourteen to injury risk. On artificial grass, the soft ground model on dry and wet conditions and the turf model in wet conditions are related to worse performance. Compared to rounded studs, bladed ones improve performance during changes of directions in both natural and synthetic grass. Cleat models presenting better traction on the stance leg improve ball velocity while those presenting a homogeneous pressure across the foot promote better kicking accuracy. Bladed studs can be considered less secure by increasing plantar pressure on lateral border. The turf model decrease peak plantar pressure compared to other studded models. Conclusion . The soft ground model provides lower performance especially on artificial grass, while the turf model provides a high protective effect in both fields.","The paper systematically reviews the impact of cleat-surface interactions on both performance and injury risk in soccer players. It highlights that specific cleat designs, such as bladed studs, can enhance performance during directional changes but may increase injury risk due to higher plantar pressure, while the turf model cleats demonstrate a protective effect on both artificial and natural grass."

Fatigue influences lower extremity angular velocities during a single-leg drop vertical jump,2017-01-01,Society of Physical Therapy Science,Journal of Physical Therapy Science,"Akihiro Tamura, Kiyokazu Akasaka, Takahiro Otsudo, Junya Shiozawa, Yuka Toda, Kaori Yamada","[Purpose] Fatigue alters lower extremity landing strategies and decreases the ability to attenuate impact during landing. The purpose of this study was to reveal the influence of fatigue on dynamic alignment and joint angular velocities in the lower extremities during a single leg landing. [Subjects and Methods] The 34 female college students were randomly assigned to either the fatigue or control group. The fatigue group performed single-leg drop vertical jumps before, and after, the fatigue protocol, which was performed using a bike ergometer. Lower extremity kinematic data were acquired using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. The ratio of each variable (%), for the pre-fatigue to post-fatigue protocols, were calculated to compare differences between each group. [Results] Peak hip and knee flexion angular velocities increased significantly in the fatigue group compared with the control group. Furthermore, hip flexion angular velocity increased significantly between each group at 40 milliseconds after initial ground contact. [Conclusion] Fatigue reduced the ability to attenuate impact by increasing angular velocities in the direction of hip and knee flexion during landings. These findings indicate a requirement to evaluate movement quality over time by measuring hip and knee flexion angular velocities in landings during fatigue conditions.","This paper investigates the effects of fatigue on lower extremity landing strategies and joint angular velocities during single-leg drop vertical jumps.

Back Pain in Adolescent Athletes: Results of a Biomechanical Screening,2017-01-01,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,Sports Medicine International Open,"Steffen Mueller, Juliane Mueller, Josefine Stoll, Michael Cassel, Anja Hirschmüller, Frank Mayer","Abstract The aim was to use a short biomechanical test battery to screen adolescent athletes with and without back pain to reveal relevant and possibly preventable deficits. 1 559 adolescent athletes (m/f 945/614; 13.2±1.6y) were included. Back pain was assessed (1–5: 1=no pain; 5=maximum pain) for dichotomous categorization into back pain (BP: pain&gt;2, n=113), healthy (NBPAll: pain=1, n=1 213) and matched healthy (NBPmatched: pain=1, n=113) athletes. Athletes performed stability, performance (jumps) and trunk strength testing. The center of pressure displacement [mm], jump height [cm], peak force [N], contact time [ms] and peak torque of the trunk [Nm] were analyzed. Analysis showed a statistically significant influence of trunk strength on back pain (BP/NBPALL). Nevertheless, after including co-variables (anthropometrics, gender and training volume), there were no significant variables detectable any longer. ANOVA identified no group differences (BP/NBPmatched) in the outcome measurement for the biomechanical tests (p&gt;0.05). This short biomechanical screening shows no sufficient differentiation in adolescent athletes for back pain. Therefore, age, training load and gender has greater relevance than strength deficits or postural control. This is challenging for further understanding of the complex conditions in young athletes with back pain.","The paper investigates the relationship between biomechanical factors and back pain in adolescent athletes through a short screening test. It concludes that while trunk strength showed an influence on back pain, other factors such as age, training load, and gender are more significant in understanding back pain in this population."

Despite the popularity of core stability training, relatively little scientific research has been conducted to compare core stability in different sportsmen. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to critically examine core stability and other issues related to this topic to determine useful applications for sport conditioning programs. Furthermore, the aim of this study was to compare core stability in different sportsperson belonging to the following categories: badminton, cricket (fast bowlers) (which are the overhead athletes), football, sprinters (nonoverhead athletes). To conclude which category among the ones mentioned above have the highest core stability in terms of core endurance.Materials and Methods: Eighty participants in total were included in the study (twenty each from the above-mentioned sport). Demographic data, participation consent, and other data pertaining to their sport were taken, and they were instructed to perform core endurance tests which included the 60° flexion test, trunk extensor endurance test, right side plank test, and left side plank test. Analysis included a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the difference between the four groups.Results: ANOVA was performed and was statistically significant with P < 0.0001 for the flexion endurance test, P = 0.0030 for the extension endurance test, P = 0.0037 for right plank test, P = 0.0004 for the left plank test.

Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Muscle Injuries,2017-01-01,Springer International Publishing,Sports and Traumatology,"Sheila Jean McNeill Ingham, Leonardo Addêo Ramos, Rene Jorge Abdalla, Roberta Sessa Stilhano, Rogério Teixeira de Carvalho","Muscle injuries are extremely frequent in professional and amateur sports. Muscle strains, particularly of the hamstrings, are the most frequent injuries in football (soccer) and Australian football. Muscle injuries can be classified in relation to the time of absence into minor, moderate or SEVERE. One of the main problems in muscle injuries is the recurrence rate and this is especially common in the hamstrings group. The clinical presentation of muscle injuries is highly variable and depends on many factors related the mechanism, intensity and type of trauma. Understanding the injury as well as its cause is crucial for the development of specific treatment and prevention strategies.","The paper discusses the prevalence and clinical characteristics of muscle injuries in sports, emphasizing that hamstring strains are particularly common in football. Key points include the classification of muscle injuries based on the duration of absence from play and the significance of understanding injury mechanisms to formulate effective treatment and prevention strategies."
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: An effective conservative treatment in medial tibial stress syndrome,2017-01-01,AkiNik Publications,International Journal of Orthopaedics Sciences,"Dr. SK Rai, Dr. VP Raman, Dr. Rohit Varma, Dr. CS Mohanty","Medial Tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is one of the most common leg injuries in athletes and army soldiers, especially who are under training. Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome has been reported to occur frequently in military recruits, long distance runners, dancers, football /soccer players and gymnasts. The incidence of MTSS is reported as being between 6% and 32% in military personnel and athletes respectively. Medial Tibial stress syndrome is the condition that refers to pain on the posteromedial tibial border during exercise, after a long run or march past, with pain on palpation of the tibia over a length of at least 5 cm. Medial Tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is an overuse injury or repetitive-stress injury of the shin area. Various stress reactions of the tibia and surrounding musculature occur when the body is unable to heal properly in response to repetitive muscle contractions and Tibial strain. Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) also called as Shin Splints is a common term for shin pain during running. This is because shin pain and 'Shin Splints' can be due to several different conditions. One of the most common conditions which is frequently labeled as 'Shin Splints' is Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome. Daily Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was given for 50 days to each Army recruit and cadet who complained of shin pain. Overall, 98% of patients who received HBO therapy became pain free and could return to work faster. We concluded that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective conservative treatment for Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as a conservative treatment for medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), a common overuse injury in athletes and military personnel.

Knee Biomechanics during Side-Step Cutting and Performance on Return to Sport Tests: Retrospective Analysis Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Re- Injury,2017-01-01,OMICS Publishing Group,International Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation,"Pollard CD, Stearns Reider KM, Mia Katzel, Landel RF","Objective: Re-injury rates following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are elevated compared to rates for initial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The purpose of this study was to examine three-dimensional knee mechanics in an individual who had undergone an ACLR and then went on to re-injure that reconstructed ACL.

Methods: The primary subject was a female soccer player, 18 months post-ACLR, who then re-injured her ACL 3 months after biomechanical testing and return to sport (RTS) testing. We conducted 3-dimensional biomechanical testing of her knee mechanics and performance on return to sport (RTS) tests prior to her ACL re-injury. In addition, we compared her knee mechanics prior to re-injury to a control group of healthy female soccer athletes to determine if any biomechanical differences existed that may have indicated risk for ACL re-injury.

Results: Our findings indicate that altered lower extremity biomechanics, previously associated with increased risk of ACL injury, are present following ACLR and return to sports participation despite a lack of marked bilateral differences in performance on return to sport tests.

Conclusion: These findings are consistent with those in the literature suggesting that subjects’ post-ACLR may be adopting a strategy that minimizes loading at the knee joint. While it is not known if this biomechanical pattern increases the risk for a re-injury event, it suggests that there are deficits present following ACLR that may not be addressed with rehabilitation and recognized with RTS testing prior to return to sports participation. These findings point to an important gap in the literature with regards to clinical predictors of ACL re-injury.","This study investigates the three-dimensional knee mechanics of a female soccer player who reinjured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 18 months post-reconstruction. It reveals that altered lower extremity biomechanics linked to increased ACL injury risk persisted despite her performance being comparable to healthy athletes on return-to-sport tests, highlighting the inadequacies of current rehabilitation and testing protocols in predicting re-injury risk."
A Glance over Youth Footballers (Soccer) Injury Profile: Next Step Required to Be Professional,2017-01-01,ACT Publishing Group,International Journal of Orthopaedics,"Khatija Bahdur, Ricard Pruna","Youth football players are a special population of players. These developmental years play a key role in talent development and can build a good foundation for future success. Correct and age-appropriate training methods are essential for youth players, not just for development with regard to performance but also with regard to preventing injuries. Injuries sustained during the teenage years can create chronic problems for the player. This population is special because it is during these years that players undergo physical maturation, undergoing the changes within the body that is essential for the transition for child to adult. The rate and manner of physical maturation varies in each individual and planning around these changes is essential. Training loads, rest, and training types must be individualised to maximise progression as a player and prevent injury. The lower limbs are most susceptible to injury with the thighs, knee, ankles, groin and calf identified as common injury sites. In order to prevent injury, it is important to implement correct injury prevention methods and enhance the support and education of youth coaches in this regard.",This paper focuses on the injury profile of youth football players and highlights the importance of age-appropriate training methods to promote development and prevent injuries.

A phenomenological analysis of the &amp;ldquo;body wisdom of passing&amp;rdquo; in soccer players,2017-01-01,"Japan Society of Physical Education, Health, and Sport Sciences","Taiikugaku kenkyu (Japan Journal of Physical Education, Health and Sport Sciences)","Michiyuki Terada, Atsushi Sano","In soccer, passing has a decisive influence on the match, and can be said to be one of the game's most important elements. Regardless of playing style, in order to win, soccer players must master the ability to deliver the ball accurately to teammates. Therefore, the training menu of coaches must ensure precise passing of the ball. Even if coaches teach this, the outcome depends on the skills of individual players. If it is possible to reduce the number of failed passes as far as possible, then a better strategy than the opposing team can be achieved. For this purpose, it is necessary to refine the “passing wisdom” of soccer players. As the importance of passing in soccer is widely recognized, a number of studies have addressed this aspect. For example, an attempt has been made to clarify the mechanical structure of the kick from a biomechanics perspective, and to clarify the structure of cognitive perception from a sports psychology perspective. However, to our knowledge, there has been no phenomenological analysis of “passing wisdom” in soccer players to date. In order to analyze this, a phenomenology (Bewegungslehre des Sport) perspective needs to be adopted, and this was done in the present study. This revealed the following 7 abilities: 1) The ability to sense other players' intention. 2) The ability to sense whether the criteria for successful action meet other players' intention. 3) The ability to construct a situation based on one's own analysis. 4) The ability to recognize the criteria for effective passing. 5) The ability to sense the receiver of the pass. 6) The ability to visualize the course of the pass. 7) The ability to apply the technique to a constructed situation based on one's own analysis.","This paper presents a phenomenological analysis of ""passing wisdom"" in soccer players, emphasizing its critical role in successful gameplay. Key findings identify seven essential abilities related to effective passing, such as sensing teammates' intentions and visualizing the path of the pass, highlighting the cognitive and perceptual dimensions of this crucial skill."

There is a paucity of research on the optimization of intracranial brain dynamics to mitigate concussion; in the present study, we investigate a novel device that provides mild jugular vein compression and may provide adjunctive protection to protect the brain internally from concussive and sub-concussive impacts. The purpose of this study was to assess the tolerance and acceptance of this device in a population of normal, healthy adults undergoing exertion similar to that is experienced while participating in sports-related competition, while monitoring changes in their biomechanical, strength, power, and postural stability capabilities. Material and Methods A total 18 participants (8 females, 10 males) were tested and included in the final analysis. Laboratory data collection consisted of two separate testing sessions for all participants. During the first testing session, participants were tested while wearing either the mild jugular vein compression neck device or a sham arm device (Sham) that was worn on the upper arm and did not alter venous return; participants exchanged devices for the second session. Participants underwent a battery of physical and neurological tests that included three-dimensional (3-D) biomechanical analysis, dynamic postural control testing using a stabilometer, isokinetic strength testing using a dynamometer, and a maximum vertical jump test. Results Evaluation of vital biomechanics, postural control and dynamic stabilization, isokinetic strength, and power in this population showed no statistically significant effect of wearing a mild jugular vein compression neck device compared with a Sham armband. Conclusions The data evaluated in the current project indicate that the device is safe during high intensity and dynamic postural stabilization exercise and does not alter normal physical or neuromuscular capabilities during physical activity.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of a mild jugular vein compression device in mitigating concussion effects during high-intensity physical activities.

Mechanism of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Players,2016-12-28,Brieflands,Asian Journal of Sports Medicine,"Satoshi Kaneko, Shogo Sasaki, Norikazu Hirose, Yasuharu Nagano, Mako Fukano, Toru Fukubayashi","Background: The risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is higher in female soccer players than in male soccer players. The most common reason for non-contact ACL injury has been found to be a cutting or stopping maneuver combined with deceleration and landing from a jump. In a previous study, there was no difference in the incidence of ACL injury between offensive and defensive players and in the risk of ACL injury between goalkeepers and other players. Recently studies reported that the most frequent injury situation was pressing in male players. However, the most common type of situation associated with ACL injury in female soccer players has not been clarified. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to identify the most common type of situation associated with ACL injury in female soccer players. Methods: We handed out questionnaires to 80 female soccer players with a history of ACL injury (90 ACL injuries). The players were asked about the injury characteristics, injury circumstance, maneuver being performed when the injury occurred, and playing type associated with the injury. The players responded to the questionnaire under the guidance of the medical staff of each team. Results: The 80 female soccer players reported a total of 90 ACL injuries during soccer. Among 55 non-contact injuries, 29 (55%) occurred during a cutting maneuver and 22 (44%) occurred during pressing. On assessing the frequency distributions of playing type (pressing vs. others) and body contact (contact vs. no contact), we found that non-contact injuries at pressing were significantly more common than contact injuries at pressing (odds ratio: 3.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 - 8.25, P = 0.036) Conclusions: ACL injury often occurs as non-contact injury during pressing at the time of defense, regardless of the playing area, in female soccer players.","The paper investigates the mechanisms behind anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female soccer players, emphasizing the higher risk compared to male players. It finds that non-contact ACL injuries frequently occur during cutting maneuvers and pressing, with a significant prevalence of these injuries reported during defensive actions."

Time-motion traits and physiological, perceptual, and neuromuscular responses were investigated in 24 male soccer players across 14 matches and 6 GPBT training sessions, for a total of 420 samples. The GPBT had a greater influence on time-motion traits and perceptual responses than the NYL and UYL matches (all p < 0.001). No significant GPBT vs. match differences were found for mean heart rate or blood lactate (F = 1.228, p = 0.304, and F = 0.978, p = 0.385, respectively). Finally, the GPBT protocol led to greater impairment of the neuromuscular explosive performances when compared with those of the postmatch scores (squat jump: F = 19.991, p < 0.001; countermovement jump: F = 61.703, p < 0.001). Results identified the GPBT protocol as characterized by relatively greater high-intensity workloads than official NYL and UYL matches, requiring increased demanding efforts. In light of these outcomes, the GPBT protocol can be considered an advantageous training method for elite soccer players, capable of stimulating the physical effort and physiological capabilities required during a match. This approach is favorable when designing a training intervention according to the principle of sport specificity, as it is based on the specific metabolic demands.","The paper investigates a game profile-based training (GPBT) protocol for soccer by comparing the time-motion, physiological, and neuromuscular responses during matches and training sessions.

J Strength Cond Res 31(12): 3327-3332, 2017-This study assessed if the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) can accurately predict noncontact injury in adult soccer players when normalizing noncontact injury occurrence against match exposure levels. Senior male players (n = 89) from 5 League of Ireland semiprofessional clubs participated in the study (mean age = 23.2 ± 4.4 years; mean height = 179.5 ± 6.6 cm; mean body mass = 77.5 ± 7.8 kg). Participants performed the FMS during preseason, and their injury occurrence rates and match minutes were tracked throughout 1 season. In total, 66 noncontact injuries were recorded. No significant difference was found in FMS composite scores between players receiving noncontact injuries and players not suffering a noncontact injury (p = 0.96). There was no significant difference in exposure-normalized noncontact injury incidence between those scoring 14 or below and those scoring above 14 on the FMS (0.36 vs. 0.29 non-contact injuries per player per 1,000 match minutes). Players scoring 14 or below on the FMS had an odds ratio of 0.63 (p = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.19-2.07) of receiving a noncontact injury. Despite previous research showing links between low FMS composite scores and subsequent injury, these results suggest that the FMS cannot accurately predict a male soccer player's likelihood of receiving a noncontact injury and that a lower FMS composite score does not significantly increase their noncontact injury incidence rate per 1,000 match minutes. Caution should therefore be used when using the FMS as a predictor of noncontact injury, and pain prevalence during the FMS, previous injuries, and training/match exposure levels should also be taken into account.","This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) in predicting noncontact injury rates among male soccer players. The findings indicate that there is no significant correlation between FMS scores and the incidence of noncontact injuries, suggesting that reliance on FMS as a predictive tool for such injuries may be misplaced."

Goedhart, Bionka M.A. Huisstede","Background: Although it has been suggested that generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) is a risk factor for injury in soccer players, it remains unclear whether this applies to elite female soccer players. Purpose: To investigate whether GJH is a risk factor for injury in elite female soccer players. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Elite female soccer players in the Netherlands were screened at the start of the 2014-2015 competitive season. GJH was assessed using the Beighton score. Soccer injuries and soccer exposure were registered throughout the entire season. Poisson regression was performed to calculate incidence risk ratios (IRRs) using different cutoff points of the Beighton score (≥3, ≥4, and ≥5) to indicate GJH. Results: Of the 114 players included in the study, 20 were classified as hypermobile (Beighton score ≥4). The mean (±SD) injury incidence per player was 8.40 ± 9.17 injuries/1000 hours of soccer, with no significant difference between hypermobile and nonhypermobile players. GJH was not a risk factor for injuries when using Beighton score cutoff points of ≥3 (IRR = 1.06 [95% CI, 0.74-1.50]; P = .762), ≥4 (IRR = 1.10 [95% CI, 0.72-1.68]; P = .662), or ≥5 (IRR = 1.15 [95% CI, 0.68-1.95]; P = .602). Similarly, GJH was not a significant risk factor for thigh, knee, or ankle injuries evaluated separately. Conclusion: This study indicates that GJH is not a risk factor for injuries in elite female soccer players, irrespective of Beighton score cutoff point. Hypermobile players at this elite level might have improved their active stability and/or used braces to compensate for joint laxity.","This study investigates whether generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) poses an injury risk for elite female soccer players by analyzing injury incidence and GJH assessment using the Beighton score. The findings reveal that GJH does not significantly increase the risk of injuries among these players, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms such as enhanced stability or the use of braces."
Subjective well-being and training load predict in-season injury and illness risk in female youth soccer players,2016-12-05,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Andrew Watson, Stacey Brickson, Alison Brooks, Warren Dunn","<h3>Background</h3> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of training load (TL) and well-being on injury and illness risk in youth soccer players. <h3>Methods</h3> Throughout a 20-week season, 75 female adolescent soccer players reported mood, fatigue, stress, soreness, sleep quality, sleep hours, TL, injuries and illnesses. Well-being measures were recorded from −3 (worst) to +3 (best). TL was expressed as daily, weekly and monthly, as well as an acute:chronic workload ratio (weekly divided by monthly). Variables were compared between days with and without an injury, and with or without an illness. Poisson regression models were developed to predict daily injuries and illnesses using well-being and TL (z-scores) as predictors. <h3>Results</h3> 36 injuries and 52 illnesses were recorded. Days with an injury had lower (worse) daily mood (1.24±0.2 vs 1.16±0.1, p=0.012) and higher daily TL (517±138 vs 440±158, p=0.010). Average monthly TL was higher preceding days with an illness (12 442 ±409 vs 12 627 ±403, p=0.043), while no differences were found with respect to other measures of TL or well-being. Worse daily mood (p=0.011, OR=0.012), higher daily TL (p&lt;0.001, OR=1.98), and higher prior day TL (p=0.040, OR=1.34) were independent predictors of injury, while weekly (p=0.005, OR=1.50) and monthly TL (p=0.007, OR=1.54) were predictors of illness. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Lower mood and higher acute TL are associated with increased injury risk, while higher chronic TL increases the risk of illness. Monitoring well-being and TL may facilitate intervention to reduce in-season injury and illness.","This study investigates the relationship between training load and subjective well-being on the risk of injury and illness in female youth soccer players over a 20-week season. It finds that lower mood and higher acute training load are linked to increased injury risk, while higher chronic training load is associated with a heightened risk of illness, suggesting that tracking these factors could help mitigate health issues in athletes."
Effectiveness of foot orthoses and shock-absorbing insoles for the prevention of injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2016-12-05,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Daniel R Bonanno, Karl B Landorf, Shannon E Munteanu, George S Murley, Hylton B Menz","Objective To investigate the evidence relating to the effectiveness of foot orthoses and shock-absorbing insoles for the prevention of musculoskeletal injury. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of foot orthoses and shock-absorbing insoles for the prevention of injury. Data sources Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus from their inception up to the first week of June 2016. Results 11 trials that had evaluated foot orthoses and 7 trials that had evaluated shock-absorbing insoles were included. The median Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) score for trials that had evaluated foot orthoses and shock-absorbing insoles was 5 (range 3–8/10) and 3 (range 1–7/10), respectively. Meta-analysis found that foot orthoses were effective for preventing overall injuries (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94) and stress fractures (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.76), but not soft-tissue injuries (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.14). In contrast, shock-absorbing insoles were not effective for preventing overall injuries (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.16), stress fractures (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.32) or soft-tissue injuries (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.15). Conclusions Foot orthoses were found to be effective for preventing overall injuries and stress fractures but not soft-tissue injuries, while shock-absorbing insoles were not found to be effective for preventing any injury. However, further well-designed trials will assist the accuracy and precision of the estimates of risk reduction as the quality of the included trials varied greatly.","The paper reviews the effectiveness of foot orthoses and shock-absorbing insoles in preventing musculoskeletal injuries through a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials. The findings indicate that foot orthoses significantly reduce the risk of overall injuries and stress fractures, while shock-absorbing insoles do not demonstrate effectiveness in preventing injuries."
Modeling the Effects of Psychological Pressure on First-Mover Advantage in Competitive Interactions,2016-12-05,SAGE Publications,Journal of Sports Economics,"Tom P. Vandebroek, Brian T. McCann, Govert Vroom","The relationship between psychological pressure and performance outcomes has been studied across a variety of sporting contexts. As an extension and complement to recent empirical studies, we construct a formal model of soccer penalty shoot-outs to determine the links between psychological pressure and first-mover advantage (FMA). Our approach indicates that even seemingly simple competitive interactions may include a rich, complex set of effects. We demonstrate that psychological pressure leads to FMA in shoot-outs; however, we show that this relationship can vary depending on a variety of different factors, such as the nature of the pressure, the magnitude of the pressure, and the specific rules governing the shoot-out. Overall, our work clarifies and extends knowledge of the operation of FMA and of how psychological pressure impacts performance outcomes in competitive interactions.","The paper explores the relationship between psychological pressure and performance in soccer, specifically focusing on penalty shoot-outs and first-mover advantage (FMA). It develops a formal model to demonstrate how psychological pressure influences FMA while identifying various factors that can affect this relationship."
Vertical Jump Biomechanics Altered With Virtual Overhead Goal,2016-12-05,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Kevin R. Ford, Anh-Dung Nguyen, Eric J. Hegedus, Jeffrey B. Taylor","Virtual environments with real-time feedback can simulate extrinsic goals that mimic real life conditions. The purpose was to compare jump performance and biomechanics with a physical overhead goal (POG) and with a virtual overhead goal (VOG). Fourteen female subjects participated (age: 18.8 ± 1.1 years, height: 163.2 ± 8.1 cm, weight 63.0 ± 7.9 kg). Sagittal plane trunk, hip, and knee biomechanics were calculated during the landing and take-off phases of drop vertical jump with different goal conditions. Repeated-measures ANOVAs determined differences between goal conditions. Vertical jump height displacement was not different during VOG compared with POG. Greater hip extensor moment (P < .001*) and hip angular impulse (P < .004*) were found during VOG compared with POG. Subjects landed more erect with less magnitude of trunk flexion (P = .002*) during POG compared with VOG. A virtual target can optimize jump height and promote increased hip moments and trunk flexion. This may be a useful alternative to physical targets to improve performance during certain biomechanical testing, screening, and training conditions.","This paper investigates the impact of utilizing a virtual overhead goal (VOG) compared to a physical overhead goal (POG) on jump performance and biomechanics during a drop vertical jump. Key findings indicate that while vertical jump height remained consistent between both conditions, the VOG led to greater hip extensor moments and angular impulse, suggesting that virtual targets could serve as effective tools for enhancing performance in biomechanical assessments and training."

Anatomical and morphological characteristics may explain why groin pain is more common in male than female athletes,2016-12-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Anthony G Schache, Stephanie J Woodley, Ernest Schilders, John W Orchard, Kay M Crossley","Groin pain is prevalent in athletes who play field sports that involve repetitive agility and kicking (eg, soccer, rugby and Australian Rules football). It is prone to recurrence and chronicity, thus can be challenging to overcome. A recent review found that men are 2.5 times more likely to sustain a groin injury than women when participating in the same sport.1 This observation is probably attributable to various factors. Contrasting training and/or match workloads could potentially exist between male and female athletes. Hormonal differences may be relevant too. While acknowledging these factors, we suggest that the higher risk of groin injury for male compared with female athletes may also be attributable to sex-related differences in groin anatomy as well as pelvic and hip joint morphology.

The confluence of aponeurotic tissues across the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis, comprising fibres from the adductor and abdominal musculature, is a potential site of pathology in athletes with groin pain.

Quantitative Elastosonography of the Myotendinous Junction: Normal Behavior and Correlation With a Standard Measurement System During Functional Tests,2016-11-30,Wiley,Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine,"Paolo Minafra, Chandra Bortolotto, Ermanno Rampinini, Fabrizio Calliada, Giuseppe Monetti","Objectives In recent years, an increasing need to use imaging to assess normal and adaptive muscle function, in addition to its anatomy and structure, has emerged. We evaluated the myotendinous junction's elastosonographic behavior in light of the most recent literature on its physiologic behavior. The elastosonographic studies were compared with the results obtained from a standard measurement system to ensure a correlation with maximal muscle contraction. Methods Nineteen male professional soccer players were assessed during functional tests. The participants performed 5 repetitions at 60°/s to assess muscle strength and 3 repetitions at 30°/s to assess the maximum force peak of thigh muscles. The participants were monitored by a strength-power measurement system and an ultrasound machine equipped with multifrequency (18–6-MHz) linear array transducers. Results The 19 soccer players were aged between 19 and 34 years (mean age, 28 years). For the right rectus femoris, the results of the elastosonographic studies showed a mean elasticity value ± SD of 30.75% ± 10.05% with the muscle relaxed and a value of 13.75% ± 8.44% during contraction (mean decrease, 17.00% ± 11.71%). Elasticity values were 36.48% ± 8.39% before contraction and 8.77% ± 6.55% during contraction of the left rectus femoris muscle (mean decrease, 27.71% ± 11.95%). For 30° eccentric contraction of the left leg, correlation with the standard measurement system showed Pearson r values of −0.53 and −0.51 when comparing force peak and mean work, respectively, with elasticity values. Conclusions Our study shows that strain elastosonographic quantification of muscle elasticity seems to match the expected physiologic and biomechanical behavior of the myotendinous junction.","This paper investigates the elastosonographic behavior of the myotendinous junction in professional soccer players, emphasizing its correlation with standard muscle strength measurement during functional tests.

Video Analysis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injuries,2016-11-29,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),JBJS Reviews,"Victor R. Carlson, Frances T. Sheehan, Barry P. Boden","Background: As the most viable method for investigating in vivo anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, video analysis is critical for understanding ACL injury mechanisms and advancing preventative training programs. Despite the limited number of published studies involving video analysis, much has been gained through evaluating actual injury scenarios. Methods: Studies meeting criteria for this systematic review were collected by performing a broad search of the ACL literature with use of variations and combinations of video recordings and ACL injuries. Both descriptive and analytical studies were included. Results: Descriptive studies have identified specific conditions that increase the likelihood of an ACL injury. These conditions include close proximity to opposing players or other perturbations, high shoe-surface friction, and landing on the heel or the flat portion of the foot. Analytical studies have identified high-risk joint angles on landing, such as a combination of decreased ankle plantar flexion, decreased knee flexion, and increased hip flexion. Conclusions: The high-risk landing position appears to influence the likelihood of ACL injury to a much greater extent than inherent risk factors. As such, on the basis of the results of video analysis, preventative training should be applied broadly. Kinematic data from video analysis have provided insights into the dominant forces that are responsible for the injury (i.e., axial compression with potential contributions from quadriceps contraction and valgus loading). With the advances in video technology currently underway, video analysis will likely lead to enhanced understanding of non-contact ACL injury.","This paper reviews the role of video analysis in understanding anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, focusing on identifying specific conditions and kinematic factors that increase the risk of such injuries during sports activities. It establishes that high-risk landing positions, rather than inherent risk factors, significantly contribute to ACL injuries, suggesting that targeted preventative training based on video insights is crucial for injury mitigation."
Leg Stiffness in Female Soccer Players: Intersession Reliability and the Fatiguing Effects of Soccer-Specific Exercise,2016-11-24,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Mark B.A. De Ste Croix, Jonathan D. Hughes, Rhodri S. Lloyd, Jon L. Oliver, Paul J. Read","De Ste Croix, MBA, Hughes, JD, Lloyd, RS, Oliver, JL, and Read, PJ. Leg stiffness in female soccer players: intersession reliability and the fatiguing effects of soccer-specific exercise. J Strength Cond Res 31(11): 3052-3058, 2016-Low levels of leg stiffness and reduced leg stiffness when fatigue is present compromise physical performance and increase injury risk. The purpose of this study was to (a) determine the reliability of leg stiffness measures obtained from contact mat data and (b) explore age-related differences in leg stiffness after exposure to a soccer-specific fatigue protocol in young female soccer players. Thirty-seven uninjured female youth soccer players divided into 3 subgroups based on chronological age (under 13 [U13], under 15 [U15], and under 17 [U17] year-olds) volunteered to participate in the study. After baseline data collection, during which relative leg stiffness, contact time, and flight time were collected, participants completed an age-appropriate soccer-specific fatigue protocol (SAFT). Upon completion of the fatigue protocol, subjects were immediately retested. Intersession reliability was acceptable and could be considered capable of detecting worthwhile changes in performance. Results showed that leg stiffness decreased in the U13 year-olds, was maintained in the U15 age group, and increased in the U17 players. Contact times and flight times did not change in the U13 and U15 year-olds, but significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in the U17 age group. The data suggest that age-related changes in the neuromuscular control of leg stiffness are present in youth female soccer players. Practitioners should be aware of these discrepancies in neuromuscular responses to soccer-specific fatigue, and should tailor training programs to meet the needs of individuals, which may subsequently enhance performance and reduce injury risk.","This study investigates leg stiffness in female soccer players, focusing on its intersession reliability and the effects of soccer-specific fatigue across different age groups. The findings reveal that leg stiffness varies by age, with younger players experiencing a decrease post-fatigue, while older players show a maintenance or increase in stiffness, highlighting the need for age-tailored training interventions to optimize performance and minimize injury risk."
"Incidence, Mechanisms, and Severity of Match-Related Collegiate Men’s Soccer Injuries on FieldTurf and Natural Grass Surfaces: A 6-Year Prospective Study",2016-11-22,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,Michael C. Meyers,"Background: Numerous injuries have been attributed to playing on artificial turf. More recently, newer generations of artificial turf have been developed to duplicate the playing characteristics of natural grass. Although artificial turf has been deemed safer than natural grass in some studies, few long-term studies have been conducted comparing match-related collegiate soccer injuries between the 2 playing surfaces. Hypothesis: Collegiate male soccer athletes do not experience any difference in the incidence, mechanisms, or severity of match-related injuries between FieldTurf and natural grass. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Male soccer athletes from 11 universities were evaluated over 6 seasons. Demographic features and predictors included player position, cleat design, player weight, turf age, and environmental factors. Outcomes of interest included injury incidence, injury category, time loss, injury mechanism and situation, type of injury, injury grade and anatomic location, injury severity, head and lower extremity trauma, and elective medical procedures. All match-related injuries were evaluated by the attending head athletic trainer and team physicians on site and subsequently in the physician’s office when further follow-up and treatment were deemed necessary. In sum, 765 collegiate games were evaluated for match-related soccer injuries sustained on FieldTurf or natural grass during 6 seasons. Results: Overall, 380 team games (49.7%) were played on FieldTurf versus 385 team games (50.3%) played on natural grass. A total of 722 injuries were documented, with 268 (37.1%) occurring on FieldTurf and 454 (62.9%) on natural grass. Multivariate analysis per 10 team games indicated a significant playing surface effect: F 2,720 = 7.260, P = .001. A significantly lower total injury incidence rate (IIR) of 7.1 (95% CI, 6.6-7.5) versus 11.8 (95% CI, 11.3-12.2; P &lt; .0001) and lower rate of substantial injuries, 0.7 (95% CI, 0.5-1.0) versus 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.3; P &lt; .03), were documented on FieldTurf versus natural grass, respectively. Analyses also indicated significantly less trauma on FieldTurf when comparing injury category, time loss, player position, injury mechanism and situation, injuries under various environmental conditions, cleat design, turf age, anatomic location, and elective medical procedures. No significant difference (F 11,710 = 0.822, P = .618) between surfaces by knee injury was observed, with the majority of knee injuries involving patellar tendinopathies/syndromes followed by medial collateral ligament injuries on both surfaces. Conclusion: Although similarities existed between FieldTurf and natural grass during competitive match play, FieldTurf is, in many cases, safer than natural grass when comparing injuries in collegiate men’s soccer. The findings of this study, however, may not be generalizable to other levels of competition or to other artificial surfaces.","This study investigates the incidence, mechanisms, and severity of match-related injuries among collegiate men's soccer players on FieldTurf compared to natural grass over six seasons. The findings indicate a significantly lower injury incidence and severity on FieldTurf, suggesting it may be a safer playing surface than natural grass for collegiate soccer."

METHOD A cross-sectional study with 155 participants (64 adolescents and 91 adults) aged between 11 and 50 years old. Among the adults, history of sports was evaluated during face-to-face interviews, and information regarding the adolescents' training routines was provided by their coaches. Body composition was evaluated using Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry which provided data about bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), fat mass (FM), and free fat mass (FFM). RESULTS Adults who engaged in sports practice during early life had higher values of BMC (ES-r = 0.063), FFM (ES-r = 0.391), and lower values of FM (ES-r = 0.396) than sedentary adults. Higher values of BMC (ES-r = 0.063) and BMD in lower limbs (ES-r = 0.091) were observed in active adolescents. Adolescents engaged in sports and adults who were sedentary in early life presented similar values in all bone variables, FM, and FFM.

Hip Strength as an Intrinsic Risk Factor for Lateral Ankle Sprains in Youth Soccer Players: A 3-Season Prospective Study,2016-11-17,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Roel De Ridder, Erik Witvrouw, Mieke Dolphens, Philip Roosen, Ans Van Ginckel","Numerous epidemiological studies have emphasized the burden of lateral ankle sprains in youth soccer players. However, no prospective study has identified intrinsic physical and modifiable risk factors for these injuries in this particular population. Although injury prevention programs in soccer incorporate proximal hip and core stability exercises, it is striking that the relationship between impaired proximal hip function and ankle sprains has not yet been prospectively investigated in youth soccer players.This prospective study aimed to examine whether hip muscle strength is a risk factor for sustaining a lateral ankle sprain in youth soccer players. We hypothesized that decreased hip muscle strength would predispose youth soccer players to an increased risk of lateral ankle sprains.Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.This study included a total of 133 male youth soccer players (age divisions U11-U17) for analysis. At the beginning of the season, anthropometric characteristics were collected and hip muscle strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Injury registration was performed by the team medical staff during 3 consecutive seasons. A principal-component, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for sustaining a lateral ankle sprain.Twelve participants (18% of all reported injuries) sustained a lateral ankle sprain (0.36 per 1000 athletic-exposure hours). After adjustment for body size dependencies and other hip muscle forces, an increase in hip muscle extension force was associated with a significant decrease in the hazard of the injury (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.9; P = .028). No other study variable could be identified as a risk factor for lateral ankle sprains.Reduced hip extension muscle strength is an independent risk factor for lateral ankle sprains in male youth soccer players. Other hip muscle strength outcomes were not identified as risk factors. Replication in larger samples with more injured cases is warranted to further ascertain the importance of this risk factor.","This study investigates the role of hip muscle strength as a potential intrinsic risk factor for lateral ankle sprains in male youth soccer players, emphasizing the lack of prior prospective research in this area. The findings indicate that reduced hip extension muscle strength significantly increases the risk of sustaining such injuries, while other hip strength variables did not show a correlation."
Nonmodifiable risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament injury,2016-11-16,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Current Opinion in Pediatrics,"Meghan J. Price, Maria Tuca, Frank A. Cordasco, Daniel W. Green","Purpose of review As anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is becoming increasingly prevalent in the population of active children and young adolescents, it is crucial to be aware of both the modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that place this population at increased ACL injury risk. Historically, there has not been a definitive consensus on all of these risk factors—particularly the nonmodifiable ones. Recent findings The present review has accumulated the most recent evidence for the nonmodifiable risk factors in ACL injury focusing particularly on female gender, generalized joint laxity, knee recurvatum, increased lateral tibial slope, decreased intercondylar notch width, structural lower extremity valgus, limb length discrepancy, family history, and history of contralateral knee ACL injury. Summary Physicians should be aware of the nonmodifiable risk factors for ACL tears in active children and adolescents and should also encourage avoidance of modifiable risk factors in this population. Young athletes with nonmodifiable risk factors are at a particularly increased risk of recurrent injury following ACL reconstruction (ACLR). We believe that a primary extra-articular augmentation via iliotibial band tenodesis at the same time of ACLR may decrease the rate of reinjury for the high risk athlete with multiple nonmodifiable risk factors.","The paper discusses the increasing prevalence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries among active children and adolescents, highlighting both modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. Key nonmodifiable factors identified include female gender, generalized joint laxity, and structural lower extremity characteristics, emphasizing the need for awareness and preventive strategies among physicians to reduce the risk of ACL injuries in this population."
Treatment of muscle injuries in football,2016-11-16,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Peter Ueblacker, Lutz Haensel, Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt","Muscle injuries are frequent and represent one of the most substantial medical problems in professional football. They can have both traumatic and overuse causes with direct practical consequence due to differences in terms of the post-primary care regimen and prognosis. An accurate diagnosis is the first step towards a specific treatment and usually allows to predict return to play (RTP). Current treatment principles have no firm scientific basis; they are practiced largely as empirical medicine due to a lack of prospective randomised studies. Immediate treatment usually follows the PRICE-principle (protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation). Depending on the type of the muscle injury, specific physical and physiotherapeutical procedures as well as rehabilitative exercises and gradual training therapy are used to recondition the injured structure, to restore coordination and proprioception, and to normalise movement patterns. Injection therapy with various substances is frequently used, with positive results empirically, but evidence in form of prospective randomised studies is lacking. A precise rehabilitation plan should be developed for every muscle injury, including recommendations for sport-specific training with increasing intensity. Since there are no guidelines regarding safe RTP, regular follow-up examinations on the current muscle status are crucial to evaluate the progress made in terms of healing and to determine when the injured muscle can be exposed to the next step of load. This narrative review describes the various factors that a medical team should consider during assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of a muscle injury with particular focus on professional football.","This paper reviews the treatment and rehabilitation of muscle injuries in professional football, highlighting the frequency and causes of such injuries. It emphasizes the need for accurate diagnosis, individualized rehabilitation plans, and the importance of follow-up examinations for safe return to play, while noting the lack of scientific basis for current treatment principles."
Sex Differences in Anthropometrics and Heading Kinematics Among Division I Soccer Athletes,2016-11-15,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"Abigail C. Bretzin, Jamie L. Mansell, Ryan T. Tierney, Jane K. McDevitt","Soccer players head the ball repetitively throughout their careers; this is also a potential mechanism for a concussion. Although not all soccer headers result in a concussion, these subconcussive impacts may impart acceleration, deceleration, and rotational forces on the brain, leaving structural and functional deficits. Stronger neck musculature may reduce head-neck segment kinematics.The relationship between anthropometrics and soccer heading kinematics will not differ between sexes. The relationship between anthropometrics and soccer heading kinematics will not differ between ball speeds.Pilot, cross-sectional design.Level 3.Division I soccer athletes (5 male, 8 female) were assessed for head-neck anthropometric and neck strength measurements in 6 directions (ie, flexion, extension, right and left lateral flexions and rotations). Participants headed the ball 10 times (25 or 40 mph) while wearing an accelerometer secured to their head. Kinematic measurements (ie, linear acceleration and rotational velocity) were recorded at 2 ball speeds.Sex differences were observed in neck girth ( t = 5.09, P < 0.001), flexor and left lateral flexor strength ( t = 3.006, P = 0.012 and t = 4.182, P = 0.002, respectively), and rotational velocity at both speeds ( t = -2.628, P = 0.024 and t = -2.227, P = 0.048). Neck girth had negative correlations with both linear acceleration ( r = -0.599, P = 0.031) and rotational velocity at both speeds ( r = -0.551, P = 0.012 and r = -0.652, P = 0.016). Also, stronger muscle groups had lower linear accelerations at both speeds ( P < 0.05).There was a significant relationship between anthropometrics and soccer heading kinematics for sex and ball speeds.Neck girth and neck strength are factors that may limit head impact kinematics.","The paper examines sex differences in anthropometric measurements and heading kinematics among Division I soccer athletes, focusing on the relationship between neck girth and neck strength with head impact kinematics during heading activities. It highlights that stronger neck musculature is associated with reduced linear acceleration and rotational velocity, suggesting that these factors play a role in limiting head impact kinematics during soccer headers."

Very-Heavy Sled Training for Improving Horizontal-Force Output in Soccer Players,2016-11-11,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Jean-Benoît Morin, George Petrakos, Pedro Jiménez-Reyes, Scott R. Brown, Pierre Samozino, Matt R. Cross","Background: Sprint running acceleration is a key feature of physical performance in team sports, and recent literature shows that the ability to generate large magnitudes of horizontal ground-reaction force and mechanical effectiveness of force application are paramount. The authors tested the hypothesis that very-heavy loaded sled sprint training would induce an improvement in horizontal-force production, via an increased effectiveness of application. Methods: Training-induced changes in sprint performance and mechanical outputs were computed using a field method based on velocity–time data, before and after an 8-wk protocol (16 sessions of 10- × 20-m sprints). Sixteen male amateur soccer players were assigned to either a very-heavy sled (80% body mass sled load) or a control group (unresisted sprints). Results: The main outcome of this pilot study is that very-heavy sled-resisted sprint training, using much greater loads than traditionally recommended, clearly increased maximal horizontal-force production compared with standard unloaded sprint training (effect size of 0.80 vs 0.20 for controls, unclear between-groups difference) and mechanical effectiveness (ie, more horizontally applied force; effect size of 0.95 vs –0.11, moderate between-groups difference). In addition, 5-m and 20-m sprint performance improvements were moderate and small for the very-heavy sled group and small and trivial for the control group, respectively. Practical Applications: This brief report highlights the usefulness of very-heavy sled (80% body mass) training, which may suggest value for practical improvement of mechanical effectiveness and maximal horizontal-force capabilities in soccer players and other team-sport athletes. Results: This study may encourage further research to confirm the usefulness of very-heavy sled in this context.","This paper investigates the impact of very-heavy sled training on horizontal-force output in soccer players, hypothesizing that this training method would enhance mechanical effectiveness in force application. The findings indicate that this training significantly improves both maximal horizontal-force production and sprint performance compared to standard training, suggesting its potential benefits for soccer players and other team athletes."
Investigating Center-of-Pressure Based Parameters to Quantify Athlete and Non-Athlete Balance,2016-11-11,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,Volume 3: Biomedical and Biotechnology Engineering,"Lara A. Thompson, Mehdi Badache","Through ground reaction (foot) forceplate-based, center-of-pressure (COP) parameters, we aimed to investigate differences in standing balance for young, healthy individuals from both athlete (soccer) and non-athlete subject populations. We investigated five, COP displacement and velocity parameters derived from the COP position time series. Soccer athlete and non-athlete subjects performed standing balance for postural tasks of increasing difficulty levels, by varying visual cues (eyes-open/eyes-closed) and base of support (wide/tandem foot placement), leading to four test conditions: 1) wide/eyes-open, 2) wide/eyes-closed, 3) tandem/eyes-open, 4) tandem/eyes-closed. By investigating position and velocity characteristics of the COP position time series, we observed that the soccer athletes had generally lower COP displacement and velocity parameters (meaning they were more stable and perhaps better able to control their body sway) than the non-athletes. This study lends new insights as to how parameters derived from the COP position can be utilized to determine differences in balance between normal subject populations (e.g., athletes versus non-athletes).","This paper investigates the balance differences between soccer athletes and non-athletes using center-of-pressure (COP) parameters derived from ground reaction force measurements. The study finds that soccer athletes exhibit lower COP displacement and velocity parameters, indicating greater stability and better body sway control compared to non-athletes across various postural tasks."
Return to sport activity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature athletes with manual drilling original all inside reconstruction at 8 years follow-up,2016-11-03,AVES YAYINCILIK A.Ş.,Acta Orthopaedica et Traumatologica Turcica,"Giacomo Placella, Matteo Bartoli, Marco Peruzzi, Andrea Speziali, Valerio Pace, Giuliano Cerulli","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common injuries in adolescent athletes, especially in those who bear high stress on their knees due to shearing forces. The goal of the surgical procedures in skeletally immature patients is to restore joint stability avoiding the adverse effects on the growth process. The aim of this study was to verify the return of the skeletally immature professional athletes to sports in the long-term, following ACL reconstruction with the original all-inside technique and with manual drilling.This study included 24 athletes (14 boys, 10 girls; mean age: 13.15 years, range: 9-14 years) who had radiographic evidence of open physes, were less than 14 years of age at the time of surgery and those with a minimum follow-up of eight years. All patients completed a questionnaire, the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form, and Tegner Activity Scale. Biomechanical outcomes of the KT-1000 arthrometer, gait analysis, and stabilometric and isokinetic results were also evaluated. A plain radiograph of both lower limbs was taken to obtain a precise measurement of the limb length and mechanical axis angles.The patients returned to sport activities in a mean time of 6.43 months. No rerupture or resurgery due to growth abnormalities was observed. The mean difference in length between the operated and contralateral legs was 0.4 (range: -0.2 to 0.7) cm. The mean side-to-side difference measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer was 5.2 (range: 3.5 to 7) mm in the preoperative and 0.8 (range: 0 to 2.5) mm in the postoperative measurements.In conclusion, the original all-inside technique with manual drilling with a half tunnel and short graft seems to be a very effective technique for the surgical management of ACL injuries in pediatric/adolescent athletes. A good rate of return to sports at pre-injury levels or higher, high patient satisfaction and a decent motor and proprioceptive function is possible as shown by our analysis.Level IV, Therapeutic study.","This study investigates the long-term return to sports activity in skeletally immature athletes following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the original all-inside technique with manual drilling.

Normative Tandem Gait in Collegiate Student-Athletes: Implications for Clinical Concussion Assessment,2016-11-01,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"Jessie R. Oldham, Melissa S. DiFabio, Thomas W. Kaminski, Ryan M. DeWolf, Thomas A. Buckley","Background: Impaired balance is common after concussion. The third edition of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) recommends the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) and/or tandem gait for postconcussion balance assessment. The limitations of the BESS are well documented; however, tandem gait has received little attention throughout concussion literature. The purpose of this study was to provide normative data for tandem gait in collegiate student-athletes based on sport type, concussion history, and gender. Hypothesis: Tandem gait will be influenced by concussion history, sport, and gender. Study Design: Cohort study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: Four hundred collegiate student-athletes from both collision/contact (n = 200) and limited contact/noncontact (n = 200) sports performed 4 tandem gait trials, consistent with SCAT-3 guidelines. The dependent variables included the best of the 4 trials (BEST), the mean of the 4 trials (MEAN), and the mean of each of the trials individually (ORDER). Separate multivariate analyses of variance were performed for each of the independent variables to determine effect on BEST and MEAN trial times. Significant main effects were followed up with a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A separate 1-way ANOVA was used to assess ORDER differences. Results: The mean BEST was 10.37 ± 1.76 seconds, and the MEAN was 11.32 ± 0.70 seconds. There were no significant differences in BEST or MEAN tandem gait times, respectively, between those with and without concussion history ( P = 0.41 and P = 0.69, respectively), sport type ( P = 0.57 and P = 0.42, respectively), or gender ( P = 0.73 and P = 0.49, respectively). There were significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) between ORDER of the 4 tandem gait trials across the population, with improved times at each trial. Conclusion: The results of this study provide a normative data set for tandem gait in healthy collegiate student-athletes and suggest that common determinants of balance, including concussion history, collision sport participation, and gender do not appear to influence performance, but ORDER could have significant clinical implications. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians may use these data to distinguish important determinants of tandem gait performance and improve awareness when returning an individual to play after a concussion.","This paper focuses on providing normative data for tandem gait performance in collegiate student-athletes, specifically examining the effects of concussion history, sport type, and gender.

BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS WITH OPTIMAL COMBINATION BY USING FOOT AND DISTANCE WHEN THE FUTSAL PLAYER PASSING THE BALL AGAINST THE ACCURACY OF THE TARGET,2016-11-01,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"S Fikri, F Pradhila, D Dirganta","Futsal is one kind of soccer game. Recently, futsal become more popular around the world and also in Indonesia. In the futsal game, passing the ball is an important activity. However, many inaccuracies occurs when the futsal player pass the ball towards the target. Therefore, understanding the biomechanics analysis and the factors that affects the accuracy of the pass is important. The purpose of this study is to obtain the biomechanics analysis, understanding the factors that affect the accuracy of the target when futsal player pass the ball based on using the foot and the distance, and to obtain optimal combination between those factors. We performed an experiment in which 10 futsal playing men from Industrial Engineering, Universitas Indonesia to participate. Their average mass was 63±13 kg and the average height was 172±6 cm. The experiment was designed by using two-way factorial design. Each respondent was instructed to pass the ball to a target on four different conditions based on using the foot (inside foot and instep foot) and the distance (2 m and 3 m from the target). Platform 1 in AMTI Biomechanics Force Platforms BP400600H was used to collect the kinematics data from Ground Reaction Force (GRF) and Required Coefficient of Friction (RCOF). The results showed that the distance factor influences the accuracy of the pass with p-value=0.001 and the interaction between those factors by using the foot and the distance also has an effect on the GRF with p-value=0.005. The optimal combination from those factors when futsal player pass the ball by using the inside foot and the distance was 2 m with percentage of accuracy is 91±7 %. In this experiment the respondents were limited to using just one brand of futsal shoes with two different sizes. This results the compressive force and coefficient of friction forces obtained tend to be the same for every conditions. For the development of next researches, it is recommended to use more brands of shoes so that the factors mentioned before can be compared and so the optimum shoes condition on the physical performance of the player can be determined.","This paper examines the biomechanics of futsal passing accuracy, analyzing how foot usage (inside foot vs. instep foot) and distance from the target affect performance. The study finds that the distance significantly influences passing accuracy, identifying an optimal combination of using the inside foot from 2 meters away, resulting in a 91% accuracy rate."

Twenty four of them were treated three years before because of the unilateral injuries of the ankle joint. Group I – 12 players after arthroscopically treated symptomatic anterior body impingement (ABI) as a complication of recurrent ankle sprains what was confirmed in the orthopaedic examination. Group II −12 players after conservative treatment of ankle sprains (grade I/II). The time of postoperative physiotherapy in the Group I was 14–16 weeks. The physiotherapy in the Group II lasted for 3-5 weeks after the injury. After that they returned to individual training. The first game in the Group I was played after 2–6 weeks of individual training and in the Group II after 1–2 weeks of individual training. The Group III was a control group of players without any ankle joint injuries. In the three studied groups there was performed evaluation based on the orthopaedic examination, pain assessment with the use of visual analogue scale (VAS), ankle joints range of motion measurements, ankle joints circumferences measurements, ankle dorsi- and plantar-flexion muscles relative torques (RT) measurements under isokinetic conditions. There were also performed vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) measurements during one-legged and two-legged jumps. The run-test with maximal speed and change of direction manoeuvres was performed. The return to competitive sport was assessed with the use of FAAM and basing on the game-related statistic of players. The intra-group and inter-group statistical analysis was performed. <h3>Results</h3> There were found no statistically significant differences between the involved and uninvolved leg and the control group in the joint circumferences and in the RT of ankle dorsi- and plantar-flexion muscles. The comparison between the three groups also didn't reveal any statistically significant differences between the results of the run test, vGRF during two-legged jump values, FAAM results and in the level of professional sport participation. No pain was noted during or after the performed test. In the day of measurement, all of the players were playing on the same competitive level pre-operatively and pre-injury. There were found statistically significant differences in vGRF during one-legged jumps between involved leg in Group I and dominant leg in Group III. There was also noted limited range of foot dorsiflexion in the involved leg comparing to uninvolved one in the Group I. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The evaluation performed three years after treatment of ankle joint injuries revealed good results in the clinical assessment, most of biomechanical tests, physical activity level and return to competitive sport assessment in players treated conservatively as well as in players after surgical intervention. Nevertheless, in players after ankle joint arthroscopy because of the ABI the range of foot dorsiflexion in the involved leg was limited which may have a meaning in ankle joint arthritis development in the future.","This paper evaluates the long-term functional outcomes of ankle joint injuries in professional soccer players over a three-year period, comparing results from surgical and conservative treatments. Key findings indicate that while most clinical assessments were positive, significant limitations in foot dorsiflexion were observed in players who underwent arthroscopic treatment, which may have future implications for joint health."

Aetiological factors are suggested to be direct trauma, biomechanical imbalances, poor mobility, strength imbalances and training load. A group of 28 elite female soccer players were assessed each morning during international team camps in the following objective physical markers: Sit and reach distance, Knee to wall distance and Thomas test hip range of movement. Average scores were used to educate players and individually tasked with completing specific self-management modalities to improve these scores before entering a risk environment. <h3>Results</h3> All players completed the self-directed objective tests. The physical markers were averaged out and players given individual red, amber and green scores. The markers were discussed amongst the sports medicine team and concerns regarding a player's health and fitness relayed to the coaching staff. The player was tasked with completing self directed individualised exercises to improve any flagged scores. They were also tasked with completing this in their club environment and improvement in physical markers scores was noted on subsequent camp entries. <h3>Conclusion</h3> By using specific physical markers which were individual to each player we were able to track and inform of any flagged scores during the camp morning health check. This enabled us to give a clear understanding of player readiness to train as well as informing and educating the player on how they could improve their scores through self management modalities therefore decreasing injury risk.

Prevention programs have been shown to reduce injury rates, but the mechanisms behind these programs are largely unknown. Few studies have investigated biomechanical changes after injury prevention programs in children. Purpose/Hypothesis: To investigate the effects of the F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-up program on changes to biomechanical risk factors for an ACL injury in preadolescent female soccer players. We hypothesized that the primary ACL injury risk factor of peak knee valgus moment would improve after training. In addition, we explored other kinematic and kinetic variables associated with ACL injuries.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 51 female athletes aged 10 to 12 years were recruited from soccer clubs and were placed into an intervention group (n = 28; mean [±SD] age, 11.8 ± 0.8 years) and a control group (n = 23; mean age, 11.2 ± 0.6 years). The intervention group participated in 15 in-season sessions of the F-MARC 11+ program (2 times/wk). Pre- and postseason motion capture data were collected during preplanned cutting, unanticipated cutting, double-leg jump, and single-leg jump tasks. Lower extremity joint angles and moments were estimated using OpenSim, a biomechanical modeling system.Athletes in the intervention group reduced their peak knee valgus moment compared with the control group during the double-leg jump (mean [±standard error of the mean] pre- to posttest change, -0.57 ± 0.27 %BW×HT vs 0.25 ± 0.25 %BW×HT, respectively; P = .034). No significant differences in the change in peak knee valgus moment were found between the groups for any other activity; however, the intervention group displayed a significant pre- to posttest increase in peak knee valgus moment during unanticipated cutting ( P = .044). Additional analyses revealed an improvement in peak ankle eversion moment after training during preplanned cutting ( P = .015), unanticipated cutting ( P = .004), and the double-leg jump ( P = .016) compared with the control group. Other secondary risk factors did not significantly improve after training, although the peak knee valgus angle improved in the control group compared with the intervention group during unanticipated cutting ( P = .018).The F-MARC 11+ program may be effective in improving some risk factors for an ACL injury during a double-leg jump in preadolescent athletes, most notably by reducing peak knee valgus moment.This study provides motivation for enhancing injury prevention programs to produce improvement in other ACL risk factors, particularly during cutting and single-leg tasks.","This paper investigates the impact of the F-MARC 11+ injury prevention program on biomechanical risk factors associated with ACL injuries in preadolescent female soccer players.

Visual search behaviors of association football referees during assessment of foul play situations,2016-10-28,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications,"Jochim Spitz, Koen Put, Johan Wagemans, A. Mark Williams, Werner F. Helsen","It is well reported that expert athletes have refined perceptual-cognitive skills and fixate on more informative areas during representative tasks. These perceptual-cognitive skills are also crucial to performance within the domain of sports officials. We examined the visual scan patterns of elite and sub-elite association football referees while assessing foul play situations. These foul play situations (open play and corner kick situations) were presented on a Tobii T120 Eye Tracking monitor. The elite referees made more accurate decisions and differences in their visual search behaviors were observed. For the open play situations, referees in the elite group spent significantly more time fixating the most informative area of the attacking player (contact zone) and less time fixating the body part that was not involved in the infringement (non-contact zone). Furthermore, the average total fixation time in the contact zone and non-contact zone tended to differ between the elite and sub-elite referees in corner kick situations. In conclusion, elite level referees have learned to discern relevant from less-relevant information in the same way as expert athletes. Findings have implications for the development of perceptual training programs for sport officials.","This paper investigates the visual search behaviors of elite and sub-elite association football referees during foul play assessments using eye tracking technology.

Influence of previous groin pain on hip and pelvic instep kick kinematics,2016-10-27,Informa UK Limited,Science and Medicine in Football,"Anna C. Severin, Daniel B. Mellifont, Mark G. L. Sayers","This study analyzed differences in pelvic and hip joint kinematics during maximal instep kicks from two different approach angles in football players with and without previous groin pain (Group C and PGP Group, respectively). Kinematic data were recorded at 500 Hz, from 22 semiprofessional, male football players (age 23 [19–26] years) performing 12 instep kicks from 45° and 60° approach angles. Two-way analysis of variance identified differences between groups, and Cohen's d determined the magnitude of effect sizes. Foot velocity at impact did not differ significantly between the groups for kicks from the 45° approach angle (P = 0.458, d = 0.13), although both groups slowed significantly at 60° (Group C: P < 0.001, d = 0.87; PGP Group: P < 0.001, d = 0.65). For kicks from the 45° approach angle, numerous significant differences existed between groups in pelvic and hip joint orientations, range of motion and maximal velocities. When kicking from the more acute 60° approach angle, Group C modified multiple aspects of pelvis and hip kinematics, while the PGP Group failed to adapt their technique. During maximal instep, kicking football players with previous groin pain employed different hip and pelvis kinematics to uninjured controls. The kicking kinematics adopted by the PGP group were consistent with aberrant kinetic chain utilization.","This paper investigates how previous groin pain affects hip and pelvic kinematics during instep kicks in football players. The study found that players with a history of groin pain exhibited distinct differences in joint movements and technique adaptation compared to uninjured players, particularly at acute approach angles."
Predictors of knee joint loading after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,2016-10-17,Wiley,Journal of Orthopaedic Research,"Elizabeth Wellsandt, Ashutosh Khandha, Kurt Manal, Michael J. Axe, Thomas S. Buchanan, Lynn Snyder‐Mackler","ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury results in altered knee joint mechanics which frequently continue even after ACL reconstruction. The persistence of altered mechanical loading of the knee is of concern due to its likely role in the development of post‐traumatic osteoarthritis (OA). Joint contact forces are associated with post‐traumatic OA development, but evaluation of factors influencing the magnitude of contact forces after ACL injury is needed to advance current strategies aimed at preventing post‐traumatic OA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors of knee joint contact forces after ACL reconstruction. Thirty athletes completed standard gait analysis with surface electromyography 6 months after ACL reconstruction. An electromyographic‐driven musculoskeletal model was used to estimate joint contact forces. External knee adduction moment was a significant predictor of medial compartment contact forces in both limbs, while vertical ground reaction force and co‐contraction only contributed significantly in the uninvolved limb. The large influence of the knee adduction moment on joint contact forces provides mechanistic clues to understanding the mechanical pathway of post‐traumatic OA after ACL injury. Statement of Clinical Significance: This study provides critical information in improving the understanding of mechanisms influencing the development of post‐traumatic OA after ACL injury. Further work is needed to identify additional driving factors of joint loading in the ACL‐injured limb and develop treatment strategies to avert the deleterious consequences of post‐traumatic OA. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Ringleb, J. A. Onate, B. L. Van Lunen","Previous studies have shown conflicting information regarding leg dominance as an etiological factor for the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. It remains unclear if lower extremity neuromechanical limb asymmetries exist in experienced athletes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate lower extremity neuromechanical effects of leg dominance in female collegiate soccer athletes during an unanticipated side-step cutting task. Twenty female collegiate soccer players completed an unanticipated side-step cutting task, using their dominant and non-dominant legs. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected to quantify joint angles and forces, with wireless electromyography (EMG) quantifying muscle activity. MANOVA's were conducted to determine the effect of leg dominance on hip and knee mechanics at and between pre-contact, initial contact, peak knee adduction moment, and peak stance periods. Dependent variables consisted of peak time occurrences, hip and knee rotations and moments, ground reaction force, EMG amplitudes, stance time, and approach velocity. No significant differences were found for any variables at or between the periods of interest. Collegiate female soccer athletes exhibit similar movement patterns between dominant and non-dominant legs while performing a side-step cutting task, suggesting that leg dominance does not adversely influence known biomechanical non-contact ACL risk factors.","The paper investigates the impact of leg dominance on the biomechanical performance of female collegiate soccer athletes during a side-step cutting task.

Regression analysis showed that OA in knee/ankle and physical complaints (PC) in knee/ankle/head were significantly predicted by number and severity of previous injuries (P < 0.05). Further, increases in age, training volume, and level of play were associated with an increased likelihood of presenting with OA (P < 0.05), but not PC. In conclusion, a football career may lead to specific long-term health problems in elite female players. Prevention strategies should focus on knee, ankle, and head injuries. Future studies are needed to clinically assess the prevalence rates of OA and possible neurocognitive changes.","This study investigates the prevalence of health issues and associated risk factors among former elite female football players, using a cross-sectional design and survey data from 152 participants. Key findings indicate a significant prevalence of knee problems and osteoarthritis, with factors such as age, training volume, and injury history contributing to these health concerns, highlighting the need for targeted prevention strategies and further research on long-term health impacts."
Predicting the Functional Roles of Knee Joint Muscles from Internal Joint Moments,2016-10-15,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"TERESA E. FLAXMAN, TINE ALKJÆR, ERIK B. SIMONSEN, MICHAEL R. KROGSGAARD, DANIEL L. BENOIT","INTRODUCTION: Knee muscles are commonly labeled as flexors or extensors and aptly stabilize the knee against sagittal plane loads. However, how these muscles stabilize the knee against adduction-abduction and rotational loads remains unclear. Our study sought 1) to classify muscle roles as they relate to joint stability by quantifying the relationship between individual muscle activation patterns and internal net joint moments in all three loading planes and 2) to determine whether these roles change with increasing force levels. METHODS: A standing isometric force matching protocol required subjects to modulate ground reaction forces to elicit various combinations and magnitudes of sagittal, frontal, and transverse internal joint moments. Surface EMG measured activities of 10 lower limb muscles. Partial least squares regressions determined which internal moment(s) were significantly related to the activation of individual muscles. RESULTS: Rectus femoris and tensor fasciae latae were classified as moment actuators for knee extension and hip flexion. Hamstrings were classified as moment actuators for hip extension and knee flexion. Gastrocnemius and hamstring muscles were classified as specific joint stabilizers for knee rotation. Vastii were classified as general joint stabilizers because activation was independent of moment generation. Muscle roles did not change with increasing effort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate muscle activation is not dependent on anatomical orientation but perhaps on its role in maintaining knee joint stability in the frontal and transverse loading planes. This is useful for delineating the roles of biarticular knee joint muscles and could have implications in robotics, musculoskeletal modeling, sports sciences, and rehabilitation.","This paper investigates the roles of knee joint muscles in stabilizing the joint against various loads, specifically focusing on adduction-abduction and rotational forces. It identifies specific muscle activation patterns related to internal joint moments across multiple loading planes and reveals that these roles remain consistent regardless of increasing force levels, with implications for fields such as sports sciences and rehabilitation."
Role of Vertical Jumps and Anthropometric Variables in Maximal Kicking Ball Velocities in Elite Soccer Players,2016-10-15,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Lois Rodríguez-Lorenzo, Miguel Fernandez-del-Olmo, José Andrés Sanchez-Molina, Rafael Martín-Acero","Kicking is one of the most important skills in soccer and the ability to achieve ma ximal kicking velocity with both legs leads to an advantage for the soccer player. This study examined the relationship be tween kicking ball velocity with both legs using anthropometric measurements and vertical jumps (a squat jump (SJ); a countermovement jump without (CMJ) and with the arm swing (CMJA) and a reactive jump (RJ)). Anthropome tric measurements did not correlate with kicking ball velocity. Vertical jumps correlated significantly with kicking ball velocity using the dominant leg only (r = .47, r = .58, r = .44, r = .51, for SJ, CMJ, CMJA and RJ, respectively) . Maximal kicking velocity with the dominant leg was significantly higher than with the non-dominant leg (t = 18.0 4, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that vertical jumps may be an optimal test to assess neuromuscular skills involved in kicking at maximal speed. Lack of the relationship between vertical jumps and kicking velocity with the non-dominant leg may reflect a difficulty to exhibit the neuromuscular skills during dominant leg kicking.","This paper investigates the link between vertical jump performance and maximal kicking velocity in elite soccer players, focusing on both the dominant and non-dominant legs. The findings indicate a significant correlation between vertical jump metrics and kicking velocity with the dominant leg, while highlighting a lack of relationship with the non-dominant leg, suggesting that vertical jumps can effectively assess neuromuscular skills relevant to kicking."
Effect of Instructions Prioritizing Speed or Accuracy on Kinematics and Kicking Performance in Football Players,2016-10-14,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Motor Behavior,"Roland van den Tillaar, Pål Fuglstad","The authors' purpose was to investigate if there is a speed accuracy trade-off in soccer kicking by using instructions prioritizing velocity, accuracy, or both upon soccer kicking performance and kicking direction in experienced soccer players. In addition, kinematics were measured to investigate the eventual differences in performance. Thirteen experienced male footballers performed penalty kicks with different instructions prioritizing velocity, accuracy or both. Three-dimensional kinematics, together with maximal ball velocity and hitting accuracy, were measured on all kicks. The main findings were that when the main aim was accuracy, accuracy increased, while the velocity reduced, which supports Fitts' law (Fitts, 1954 Fitts, P. M. (1954). The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 47, 381–391.[Crossref], [PubMed] , [Google Scholar]). In addition, kicking accuracy was higher when kicking to the contralateral side. The slower ball velocity was caused by lower segmental and in run velocities. These lower segmental velocities were mainly caused by the lower maximal knee extension and pelvis rotation during the accuracy priority kicks.","This paper investigates the trade-off between speed and accuracy in soccer kicking by examining how different instructional priorities affect performance and kinematics in experienced players. Key findings indicate that prioritizing accuracy leads to improved accuracy but reduced ball velocity, as influenced by lower segmental velocities resulting from diminished knee extension and pelvis rotation during kicks."
"The influence of different soccer cleat type on kinetic, kinematic and neuromuscular ankle variables in artificial turf",2016-10-14,Informa UK Limited,Footwear Science,"Diogo C.F. Silva, Rubim Santos, J. Paulo Vilas-Boas, Rui Macedo, António Montes, Andreia S.P. Sousa","Lateral ankle sprain is the most prevalent injury in soccer athletes. Enhanced by the variety of soccer cleats and by increased use of artificial turf, the interaction between the ground and the footwear has taken high importance as a lateral ankle sprain risk factor. The higher incidence of injuries in the second half of the match reflects the need of studying this interaction during tasks involving muscle fatigue. To evaluate the influence of different soccer cleats on kinetic, kinematic and neuromuscular ankle variables in artificial turf under two conditions: with and without fatigue of lateral ankle dynamic stabilizers. Study design: Experimental study within-subjects design. Twenty-four healthy athletes participated in this study. All subjects performed three sets of five medial-lateral unipodal jumps, each one with one of three models of cleats (Turf, Hard and Firm ground) on two conditions: with and without fatigue induced by the isokinetic dynamometer. The electromyographic activity of long and short peroneal heads, ground reaction forces and the movement of the rear-foot were collected and used to calculate kinematic (ankle eversion/inversion, centre of pressure displacement and velocity), kinetic (loading rate of the ground reaction forces) and neuromuscular variables (activation time of peroneal muscles). With the exception of decreased peroneal activation time with the Hard ground model (without fatigue vs. with fatigue), no statistically significant differences were identified in the ankle variables, between cleats, neither between the two evaluated conditions. In healthy soccer athletes, the contributor variables for ankle sprain were not influenced by the kind of soccer cleat in a functional test on a third generation artificial turf.","The paper investigates the impact of various soccer cleat types on kinetic, kinematic, and neuromuscular ankle variables in soccer players on artificial turf, focusing on the risk of lateral ankle sprains. The study finds that the type of cleat does not significantly influence ankle variables during functional tests, regardless of whether the athletes were fatigued or not."
Effects of Muscle Fatigue Induced by Countermovement Jumps on Efficacy Parameters of Instep Ball Kicking in Soccer,2016-10-13,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Víctor Torreblanca-Martinez, Fernando M. Otero-Saborido, José A. Gonzalez-Jurado","The purpose was to study the effects of muscle fatigue induced by countermovement jumps (CMJ) on instep kick foot velocity in young male soccer players. Fifteen under-18 soccer players from a professional club performed maximal velocity instep kicks before and after a fatigue protocol that consisted of continuous CMJ. Foot velocity at impact without fatigue, foot velocity at impact with fatigue, CMJ height without fatigue, maximum jump height in fatigue test, and CMJ height change in fatigue test on a dynamometric platform were measured. There was a significant difference between jump height with and without fatigue (P = .00; ES = 0.8), but there were no significant differences between kicking with fatigue and without fatigue (P = .580, ES = 0.10). In conclusion, although the protocol was intense enough to generate fatigue in the muscles involved in CMJ, there were no significant differences in kicking velocity under fatigue conditions with respect to kicking without fatigue in the soccer players studied.","This paper investigates the impact of muscle fatigue from countermovement jumps on the kicking performance of young male soccer players. The study found that while fatigue significantly affected jump height, it did not result in a notable difference in kicking velocity, indicating that kicking performance may remain stable despite muscle fatigue from preceding physical exertion."
The influence of gravimetric moisture content on studded shoe–surface interactions in soccer,2016-10-11,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"James Clarke, Matt J. Carré","It is desirable for the studs of a soccer shoe to penetrate the sport surface and provide the player with sufficient traction when accelerating. Mechanical tests are often used to measure the traction of shoe–surface combinations. Mechanical testing offers a repeatable measure of shoe–surface traction, eliminating the inherent uncertainties that exist when human participant testing is employed, and are hence used to directly compare the performance of shoe–surface combinations. However, the influence specific surface characteristics has on traction is often overlooked. Examining the influence of surface characteristics on mechanical test results improves the understanding of the traction mechanisms at the shoe–surface interface. This allows footwear developers to make informed decisions on the design of studded outsoles. The aim of this paper is to understand the effect gravimetric moisture content has on the tribological mechanisms at play during stud–surface interaction. This study investigates the relationships between: the gravimetric moisture content of a natural sand-based soccer surface; surface stiffness measured via a bespoke impact test device; and surface traction measured via a bespoke mechanical test device. Regression analysis revealed that surface stiffness decreases linearly with increased gravimetric moisture content (p = 0.04). Traction was found to initially increase and then decrease with gravimetric moisture content. It was observed that: a surface of low moisture content provides low stud penetration and therefore reduced traction; a surface of high moisture content provides high stud penetration but also reduced traction due to a lubricating effect; and surfaces with moisture content in between the two extremes provide increased traction. In this study a standard commercially available stud was used and other studs may provide slightly different results. The results provide insight into the traction mechanisms at the stud–surface interface which are described in the paper. The variation between traction measurements shows the influence gravimetric moisture content will have on player performance. This highlights the requirement to understand surface conditions prior to making comparative shoe–surface traction studies and the importance of using a studded outsole that is appropriate to the surface condition during play.","This paper investigates how gravimetric moisture content affects the interaction between studded soccer shoes and playing surfaces, emphasizing the importance of surface characteristics on traction. The study finds that traction varies with moisture levels, highlighting a complex relationship where optimal surface conditions can enhance player performance through appropriate stud design."
A Multicenter Study of Early Anti-inflammatory Treatment in Patients With Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear,2016-10-07,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Christian Lattermann, Cale A. Jacobs, Mary Proffitt Bunnell, Laura J. Huston, Lee G. Gammon, Darren L. Johnson, Emily K. Reinke, Janet L. Huebner, Virginia B. Kraus, Kurt P. Spindler","It is increasingly recognized that biochemical abnormalities of the joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage.The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the ability to alter this biochemical cascade.Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 (corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ρ. Outcomes and biomarkers were also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests.No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group (1.32 ± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 0.23 ± 0.27 ng/mL [ P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 ± 0.34 ng/mL [ P = .01]).PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration and intra-articular intervention.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01692756.","This paper investigates the effect of early anti-inflammatory treatment on patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and their progression to posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA).

Athletic groin pain (part 2): a prospective cohort study on the biomechanical evaluation of change of direction identifies three clusters of movement patterns,2016-10-06,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"A Franklyn-Miller, C Richter, E King, S Gore, K Moran, S Strike, E C Falvey","Background Athletic groin pain (AGP) is prevalent in sports involving repeated accelerations, decelerations, kicking and change-of-direction movements. Clinical and radiological examinations lack the ability to assess pathomechanics of AGP, but three-dimensional biomechanical movement analysis may be an important innovation. Aim The primary aim was to describe and analyse movements used by patients with AGP during a maximum effort change-of-direction task. The secondary aim was to determine if specific anatomical diagnoses were related to a distinct movement strategy. Methods 322 athletes with a current symptom of chronic AGP participated. Structured and standardised clinical assessments and radiological examinations were performed on all participants. Additionally, each participant performed multiple repetitions of a planned maximum effort change-of-direction task during which whole body kinematics were recorded. Kinematic and kinetic data were examined using continuous waveform analysis techniques in combination with a subgroup design that used gap statistic and hierarchical clustering. Results Three subgroups (clusters) were identified. Kinematic and kinetic measures of the clusters differed strongly in patterns observed in thorax, pelvis, hip, knee and ankle. Cluster 1 (40%) was characterised by increased ankle eversion, external rotation and knee internal rotation and greater knee work. Cluster 2 (15%) was characterised by increased hip flexion, pelvis contralateral drop, thorax tilt and increased hip work. Cluster 3 (45%) was characterised by high ankle dorsiflexion, thorax contralateral drop, ankle work and prolonged ground contact time. No correlation was observed between movement clusters and clinically palpated location of the participant's pain. Conclusions We identified three distinct movement strategies among athletes with long-standing groin pain during a maximum effort change-of-direction task These movement strategies were not related to clinical assessment findings but highlighted targets for rehabilitation in response to possible propagative mechanisms.

Sayers","In Australian rules football structured increases in ball size during development end with the transition to the Size 5 (adult) ball at the Under-15 age group. This study assessed changes in kick technique and performance in experienced junior performers when using Size 4 and 5 Australian rules footballs. Participants (n = 22, 13.77 ± 0.61 years) performed drop punt kicks in 2 representative tasks; a Decision-Making Test (DMT) (n = 14) and Set-Shot Test (SST) (n = 14 + 8). Results indicate participants sustained their level of kick performance (accuracy and quality of ball spin) in both tests when using a Size 5 football. Sustained kick performance in the DMT primarily resulted from adaptations to time-point technical measures at ball release. No significant differences were detected for technical measures between ball sizes in the SST. A dynamic kicking task (DMT) in combination with ball size manipulation may have placed greater demand on skill execution in comparison to a self-paced kicking task (SST). Results provide initial support for the utility of challenging representative dynamic and self-paced tasks, such as the DMT and SST used here for Australian football, for skill testing and practice in sport","This paper investigates the effects of football size on kicking performance among youth Australian rules footballers, particularly focusing on the transition from Size 4 to Size 5 balls.

The purpose of this study was thus to investigate changes in strength/power/speed characteristics of elite soccer players in response to either classic strength-power periodization (TSP) or optimum power load (OPL). 23 professional soccer players were randomly assigned to TSP or OPL for 6 weeks in-season regular training (3 times per week). TSP involved half squats or jump squats, depending on the respective training block, while OPL involved only jump squats at the optimum power load. Results revealed that both groups presented similar significant (P<0.05) improvements in squat one repetition maximum, squat and countermovement jump heights and change of direction speed. In addition, although both groups reported significant increases in sprinting speed (P<0.05); delta change scores demonstrated a superior effect of OPL to improve 10- and 20-m speed. Similarly, OPL presented greater delta change in mean propulsive power in the jump squat. Therefore, training continuously at the optimum power zone resulted in superior performance improvements compared to training under classic strength-power periodization.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of traditional strength-power training periodization versus an optimum power load training scheme on elite soccer players' neuromuscular abilities.

DiPietro","We extend previous analyses and examined sex-differences in the rate and severity of knee injuries among collegiate soccer players between 2004 and 2009. Data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance System (NCAA ISS) were used to calculate injury incidence density (ID) per 1 000 athletic exposures (AE). Multivariable regression modeling then tested the relation between sex and knee injury incidence and severity among all injured soccer players, while controlling for contact, setting, and division level, as well as for the interactions among these variables. The rate of knee injuries was 1.19 per 1 000 AEs in women and 0.91 per 1 000 AEs in men (RR=1.31, 95% Wald CI=[1.16, 1.47]). In the multivariable modeling, women continued to experience significantly higher odds of knee injury compared with men (aOR=1.44, 95% CI=[1.27,1.63]). Also, the adjusted odds of a knee injury that resulted in surgery remained higher in women compared with men (aOR=1.61 (1.00, 2.58), as well as the amount of time lost from participation (beta=0.129; p=0.05).

The purposes of this study were to (1) compare BSIPs predicted by the method introduced by de Leva 1 with DXA-derived BSIPs in collegiate female soccer players, and (2) examine the effects of these BSIP estimation methods on joint moment and power calculations during a drop vertical jump (DVJ). Twenty female NCAA Division I soccer players were recruited. BSIPs of the shank and thigh (mass, COM location, and radius of gyration) were determined using de Leva’s method and analysis of whole-body DXA scans. These estimates were used to determine peak knee joint moments and power during the DVJ. Compared with DXA, de Leva’s method located the COM more distally in the shank ( P = .008) and more proximally in the thigh ( P &lt; .001), and the radius of gyration of the thigh to be further from the thigh COM ( P &lt; .001). All knee joint moment and power measures were similar between methods. These findings suggest that BSIP estimation may vary between methods, but the impact on joint moment calculations during a dynamic task is negligible.","This study compares body segment inertial parameter (BSIP) estimation methods in collegiate female soccer players and examines their effect on joint moment and power during a drop vertical jump.

Elkin, James M. Elliott, Gunter P. Siegmund","Study Design Finite element modeling of experimental data. Background The clinical presentations of whiplash injury and concussion have considerable overlap. Both diagnoses are generally based on presenting signs and symptoms, and a history of neck or head trauma. With incomplete knowledge of the trauma, differentiating between whiplash injury and concussion can be clinically challenging. Objectives To estimate the brain strains that develop during rear-end car crashes, evaluate how these strains vary with different head kinematic parameters, and compare these strains to those generated during potentially concussive football helmet impacts. Methods Head kinematic data were analyzed from 2 prior studies, one that focused on head restraint impacts in rear-end crash tests and another that focused on football helmet impacts. These data were used as inputs to a finite element model of the human brain. Brain strains were calculated and compared to different peak kinematic parameters and between the 2 impact conditions. Results Brain strains correlated best with the head's angular velocity change for both impact conditions. The 4 crashes with head angular velocity changes greater than 30 rad/s (greater than 1719°/s) generated the highest brain stains. One crash, in which the head wrapped onto the top of the head restraint, generated brain strains similar to a 9.3-m/s rear football helmet impact, a level previously associated with concussion. Conclusion This work provides new insight into a potential biomechanical link between whiplash injury and concussion, and advances our understanding of how head restraint interaction during a rear-end crash may cause an injury more typically associated with sports-related head impacts.

The effect of LBP on the trunk and hip muscles in this group is unknown. The relationship between LBP and trunk muscle size and function in football players across the preseason was examined. A secondary aim was to assess hip muscle strength. Twenty-five elite soccer players participated in the study, with assessments conducted on 23 players at both the start and end of the preseason. LBP was assessed with questionnaires and ultrasound imaging was used to assess size and function of trunk muscles at the start and end of preseason. Dynamometry was used to assess hip muscle strength at the start of the preseason. At the start of the preseason, 28% of players reported the presence of LBP and this was associated with reduced size of the multifidus, increased contraction of the transversus abdominis and multifidus muscles. LBP decreased across the preseason, and size of the multifidus muscle improved over the preseason. Ability to contract the abdominal and multifidus muscles did not alter across the preseason. Asymmetry in hip adductor and abductor muscle strength was found between players with and without LBP.

Subgroup analysis indicated that tendon abnormalities at baseline were associated with an increased risk of both Achilles (RR=7.33, 95% CI 2.95 to 18.24) and patellar (RR=4.35, 95% CI 2.62 to 7.23) tendinopathy.This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that tendon abnormalities visualised using US in asymptomatic tendons are predictive of future tendinopathy and are associated with at least a fourfold increased risk.Identification of at-risk athletes using screening tools such as US may allow preventative programmes to be implemented. However, it is clear that other factors beyond tissue structure are involved in the development of lower limb tendinopathy.","This paper investigates the predictive capability of ultrasound imaging for future symptoms of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy in asymptomatic individuals. The systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that structural abnormalities identified through ultrasound are associated with a significantly increased risk of developing both types of tendinopathy, suggesting the potential for using ultrasound as a screening tool in athletic populations to implement preventative measures."
Differential contribution of reaction time and movement velocity to the agility performance reflects sport-specific demands,2016-09-14,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Human Movement,Erika Zemková,"Purpose This study estimates the contribution of reaction time and movement velocity to the reactive agility time while covering varied distances. Methods A total of 95 athletes of karate, hockeyball and soccer participated in a simple reaction, two choice reaction, step initiation and reactive agility test. Results Agility time was significantly better in karate-kumite than karate-kata practitioners when covering a distance of 0.8 m (8.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045), better in hockeyball players than goalies when covering a distance of 1.6 m (10.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.028) and better in soccer players than goalies when covering a distance of 3.2 m (14.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009). Movement velocity to agility time contributed to a lesser degree in the case of karate-kata competitors, hockeyball and soccer players (33.5%, 28.3%, and 19.9% respectively) than the karate-kumite competitors, hockeyball and soccer goalies (44.2%, 42.7%, and 39.4% respectively). Furthermore, both simple and two choice reaction times were highly related to the agility time when covering distances of 0.8 m, 1.6 m, and 3.2 m (r in range from 0.72 to 0.88). Movement velocity also significantly correlated with the agility time in the test with a distance of 0.8 m (r = 0.76) but not with longer movement distances of 1.6 (r = 0.61) and 3.2 m (r = 0.52). Conclusions Reaction time and movement velocity differentially contribute to the agility time in athletes of varied specializations. This reflects their specific demands on agility skills, and therefore should be addressed in agility testing in order to identify an athlete’s weakness.","This study analyzes the contributions of reaction time and movement velocity to agility performance in various sports, specifically karate, hockey, and soccer. Results highlight that agility is influenced by sport-specific demands, with differences in performance observed across different athlete specializations and distances, suggesting the need for tailored agility testing to identify athletes' weaknesses."

Myer, Kevin R. Ford, Mark V. Paterno, Carmen E. Quatman","Economic and societal pressures influence modern medical practice to develop and implement prevention strategies. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury devastates the knee joint leading to short term disability and long term sequelae. Due to the high risk of long term osteoarthritis in all treatment populations following ACL injury, prevention is the only effective intervention for this life-altering disruption in knee health. The ""Sequence of Prevention"" Model provides a framework to monitor progress towards the ultimate goal of preventing ACL injuries. Utilizing this model, our multidisciplinary collaborative research team has spent the last decade working to delineate injury mechanisms, identify injury risk factors, predict which athletes are at-risk for injury, and develop ACL injury prevention programs. Within this model of injury prevention, modifiable factors (biomechanical and neuromuscular) related to injury mechanisms likely provide the best opportunity for intervention strategies aimed to decrease the risk of ACL injury, particularly in female athletes. Knowledge advancements have led to the development of potential solutions that allow athletes to compete with lowered risk of ACL injury. Design and integration of personalized clinical assessment tools and targeted prevention strategies for athletes at high risk for ACL injury may transform current prevention practices and ultimately significantly reduce ACL injury incidence.

Your personal movie producer,2016-09-07,ACM,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers,"Dominik Schuldhaus, Carolin Jakob, Constantin Zwick, Harald Koerger, Bjoern M. Eskofier","Manually browsing through high amount of sports videos, selecting interesting highlight scenes, and applying video effects are time-consuming and one major burden these days. Automatic approaches are preferred, but currently require high-quality TV broadcast material which is usually not available in recreational sports. Thus, the purpose of this paper was to develop a personal low-cost movie producer for highlight videos using wearables. The feasibility of the proposed approach was shown for soccer scenarios. The automatic highlight video generation included three contributions: (i) sensor-based full-instep kick detection and extraction of corresponding video segments, (ii) sensor-based ball speed estimation for provision of highlight-related metadata shown in the final video, and (iii) sensor-driven video effect generation. The proposed system was evaluated on eleven subjects which were equipped with inertial sensors in the cavity of soccer shoes. A mean sensitivity of 95.6 % and a mean absolute error of 7.7 km/h were achieved for the full-instep kick classification and the ball speed estimation, respectively. This personal movie producer based on wearables is a novel idea to provide recreational athletes with attractive automatically generated highlight videos in sports.","The paper presents a novel approach for generating highlight videos in recreational soccer using wearable technology, addressing the challenges of manual video selection and editing.

Reducing purposeful headers from goal kicks and punts may reduce cumulative exposure to head acceleration,2016-09-06,Informa UK Limited,Research in Sports Medicine,"Jaclyn B. Caccese, Lindsey C. Lamond, Thomas A. Buckley, Thomas W. Kaminski","The purpose of this study was to measure peak linear and rotational head acceleration in women’s collegiate soccer and explore the variations in acceleration across different strategic scenarios. Game videos from 14 games were used to identify the strategic scenario in which the athlete headed the ball. Strategic scenarios included: bounce, secondary header, punt, throw-in, goal kick, corner kick, and kick. Peak linear and rotational accelerations were measured using the Smart Impact Monitor (Triax Technologies Inc., Norwalk, CT). Goal kick (38.8 ± 19.4 g, p = 0.001, ß = 8.9; 9.3 ± 3.9 krad/s2, p = 0.004, ß = 1.9) and punt (36.0 ± 15.1 g, p = 0.055, ß = 6.3; 10.1 ± 4.8 krad/s2, p = 0.002, ß = 2.5) impacts resulted in higher linear and rotational head accelerations than the base variable, kick (30.0 ± 19.5 g; 7.5 ± 4.1 krad/s2). This suggests that limiting headers from goal kicks and punts in younger athletes who are still learning proper heading technique may limit cumulative linear and rotational accelerations.","This study investigates peak linear and rotational head acceleration in women's collegiate soccer during various strategic scenarios, particularly focusing on goal kicks and punts.

"Mechanical Player Load™ using trunk-mounted accelerometry in football: Is it a reliable, task- and player-specific observation?",2016-09-06,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Paulo Barreira, Mark A. Robinson, Barry Drust, Niels Nedergaard, Raja Mohammed Firhad Raja Azidin, Jos Vanrenterghem","The aim of the present study was to examine reliability and construct convergent validity of Player Load™ (PL) from trunk-mounted accelerometry, expressed as a cumulative measure and an intensity measure (PL · min-1). Fifteen male participants twice performed an overground football match simulation that included four different multidirectional football actions (jog, side cut, stride and sprint) whilst wearing a trunk-mounted accelerometer inbuilt in a global positioning system unit. Results showed a moderate-to-high reliability as indicated by the intra-class correlation coefficient (0.806-0.949) and limits of agreement. Convergent validity analysis showed considerable between-participant variation (coefficient of variation range 14.5-24.5%), which was not explained from participant demographics despite a negative association with body height for the stride task. Between-task variations generally showed a moderate correlation between ranking of participants for PL (0.593-0.764) and PL · min-1 (0.282-0.736). It was concluded that monitoring PL® in football multidirectional actions presents moderate-to-high reliability, that between-participant variability most likely relies on the individual's locomotive skills and not their anthropometrics, and that the intensity of a task expressed by PL · min-1 is largely related to the running velocity of the task.","The paper investigates the reliability and construct validity of Player Load™ (PL) measurements obtained from trunk-mounted accelerometry during simulated football matches.

"Abstract: Comparative Impact Resistance of Titanium Mesh (Ti), Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) in an in vitro Cranioplasty Model",2016-09-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery - Global Open,"Matthew J. Murphy, Ian Sunderland, Glenn Edwards, James Mainprize, Cari Whyne, Oleh Antonyshyn","PURPOSE: To determine in vitro biomechanical properties (impact resistance and shape retention) of common cranioplasty materials. METHODOLOGY: A virtual skull model with two topographically distinct defects was created. Defects (8x6cm) were designed to represent one highly contoured site (frontoorbital - FO) and one relatively flat site (temporoparietal - TP). Three cranioplasty materials (Ti, PMMA and PEEK) were used to manufacture custom skull-specific implants for rigid fixation to the two defects on the skull model. Impact testing used a falling weight design with increasing kinetic energies (KE), as per the American Society of Testing and Materials. Known impact forces associated with common etiologies of blunt head trauma were referenced to define input KE for increasing levels of impact. Implants were successively tested at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 joules of energy. Post impact inspection defined failure as implant fracture, >3mm deformation or fixation failure. A load cell measured impact force while a high-speed camera determined impact duration. Group outcomes were measured per site as the average impact force and mechanism of failure. RESULTS: Initial impact testing (0.5 J) resulted in failure of all Ti implants (>3mm deformation) at both defect sites. PMMA and PEEK implants were unchanged. Impact force was significantly different in all groups for TP defects (Ti = 121.7 N, PEEK = 676.7 N, PMMA = 872.3 N) and was significantly less for Ti (154.7 N) when compared with PEEK (954.5 N) and PMMA (932.8 N) for FO defects. Completion of FO defect testing (PEEK, PMMA) yielded no failures and had no significant differences in force profiles at 1.0 J (1440.5 N, 1371.8 N), 3.0 J (2613.1 N, 2492.5 N) or 5.0 J (3126.1 N, 3163.3 N). Completion of TP defect testing (PEEK, PMMA) yielded significant differences in force profiles at 1.0 J (1022.9 N, 1297.0 N). At 3.0 J, all PMMA implants fractured while PEEK tolerated impact with an average force of 1760.4N. At 5.0J, PEEK failed secondary to fixation failure only. CONCLUSIONS: Ti failed at energies calculated to reproduce the force of a soccer head ball.1 PMMA and PEEK were significantly stronger, with FO defects experiencing forces similar to a professional boxer punch2 or impact into a rigid steering hub at 31mph.3 These findings will guide implant material selection and patient safety.

Latest Clinical Research Published by ACSM,2016-09-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Current Sports Medicine Reports,Carrie A. Jaworski,"Quadriceps Strength Predicts Self-Reported Function Post ACL Reconstruction Research demonstrates that a patient’s self-reported function after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) influences their likelihood of returning to their desired level of physical activity postoperatively. Additionally, quadriceps strength status post-ACLR is a useful clinical predictor of self-reported function. It remains unknown whether the quadriceps strength normalized to body mass (QBM) or the quadriceps strength limb symmetry index (QLSI) is the best predictor of self-reported function in individuals with ACLR. The authors of this article in the September 2016 issue of Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise®, sought to determine if QBM and QLSI were able to predict individuals with ACLR who self-report high function defined as ≥90% on the International Knee Documentation Committee Index (IKDC) (2). The study looked at 96 individuals (62 women and 34 men) with a history of primary unilateral ACLR. The majority of participants had a patellar tendon autograft (58.3%), whereas 38.5% had a hamstring autograft and only 3.1% reported allograft for their ACLR. The participants completed the subjective portion of the IKDC and were considered to have high self-reported function if they scored ≥90%. Quadriceps strength testing was conducted using two types of isokinetic dynamometers and included sufficient practice trials before maximal effort testing trial measurements were taken. Bilateral isometric strength was collected at 90° of knee flexion to calculate QBM and QLSI. The area under the curve values were calculated to determine the capacity of QBM and QLSI to predict individuals with high self-reported function on the IKDC. The results demonstrated that QBM displayed high accuracy for identifying participants with an IKDC ≥90%. A QBM cutoff score of 3.10 Nm·kg−1 was found to maximize sensitivity and specificity and displayed 8.15 times higher odds of reporting high function. QLSI only displayed a moderate degree of accuracy where a cutoff score of 96.5% maximized sensitivity and specificity and represented 2.78 times higher odds of reporting high function. Bottom Line: QBM was found to be a stronger predictor of high self-reported function compared with QLSI in individuals with ACLR. It may be beneficial to include QBM measurements in the rehabilitation programs of individuals who have undergone ACLR to improve self-reported function. In fact, it may be an important clinical benchmark to strive to achieve a QBM of ≥3.10 Nm·kg−1 to maximize self-reported function post-ACLR. Head Impact Biomechanics in Women’s Collegiate Soccer Women’s collegiate soccer has the fifth highest concussion rate amongst National Collegiate Athletic Association sports. Epidemiological data suggest that female collegiate soccer players are at a two times greater concussion injury risk than their male counterparts and that females may take longer to recover. The purpose of this study also in the September 2016 issue of Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise® was to quantify head impact frequency and magnitude during National Collegiate Athletic Association women’s soccer practices and games and to characterize the data across event type, position played, year on the team, and segment of the game (1). A prospective cohort design was used to study head impact frequency and magnitude for a particular women’s collegiate soccer team over one season. Data were collected using a helmetless head impact measurement device known as the ×2 Biosystems × Patch that measured peak linear and rotational accelerations from practices and games. The device was affixed over the right mastoid process and was able to collect data for up to 6 h. A 10-g threshold was set for measurements based on previous data demonstrating soccer heading to be between 10 and 25 g and activities, such as running and jumping, to not exceed 9.54 g of linear acceleration. Linear accelerations (g) were categorized as 10 to 19.9, 20 to 29.9, 30 to 39.9, and 40+. Rotational accelerations (rad·s2) were categorized as follows: <2499.9, 2,500 to 7,499.9, 7,500 to 12,499.9, and 12,500+. Data were analyzed from 22 participants across 18 competition and 39 practice events. There were a total of 16,775 min and 1,335 head impacts recorded across all games for a rate of 74.17 impacts per game and 7.16 head impacts per player per 90 min played. During practices, 1,564 head impacts were recorded for a rate of 40.10 impacts per practice. The median number of impacts per player for all practices was 36, ranging from 5 to 296 impacts per player. The median head impact linear acceleration was 12.51 g for games and 12.78 g for practices. The 90th percentile head impacts for games was 18.59 g of linear acceleration and 4, 015.85 rad·s2 of rotational acceleration. During practices, it was 21.84 g and 4,844.23 rad·s2, respectively. Midfielders experienced 1.23 and 1.15 times the rate of head impacts during games and practices. Freshman and sophomores experienced 2.77 times the rate of head impacts compared with juniors and seniors. The second half of games had a greater proportion of high categorized linear accelerations. The overwhelming majority of all head impacts (~90%) fell into the mildest linear acceleration impact classification of 10 g to 20 g. The authors observed that there were a higher percentage of practice impacts in the 20 g to 40 g range compared with games. (11% vs 7%). Of note, no impacts leading to a clinical concussion diagnosis were captured during this observation period. Bottom Line: Although limited based on this being the study of only one team during one season, the preliminary data suggest that higher magnitude head impacts occur during practices compared with games in women’s collegiate soccer. This is an opportunity for further study and perhaps adjustments to the number of drills in soccer practices that could put athletes at risk of head injury. By increasing one’s understanding of the biomechanics associated with concussions in women’s soccer further, this will help in the development of future intervention studies to increase sport safety.","1. **Quadriceps Strength Predicts Self-Reported Function Post ACL Reconstruction**: This paper investigates the relationship between quadriceps strength and self-reported functional outcomes in individuals post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It finds that quadriceps strength normalized to body mass is a strong predictor of high self-reported function, suggesting its importance in rehabilitation protocols.

2. **Head Impact Biomechanics in Women’s Collegiate Soccer**: This study quantifies the frequency and magnitude of head impacts experienced by women’s collegiate soccer players during games and practices. It reveals that players experience a higher rate of head impacts during practices compared to games, with implications for understanding concussion risks and potential adjustments in training protocols to enhance athlete safety."

A multidisciplinary clinical team independently made concussion diagnoses (n = 24). We dichotomized each impact using diagnosis (yes = 24, no = 283,324) and across a range of plausible impact indicator thresholds (10g increments beginning with a resultant linear head acceleration of 50g and ending with 120g).Some thresholds had adequate sensitivity, specificity, and PV-. All thresholds had low PV+, with the best recorded PV+ less than 0.4% when accounting for all head impacts sustained by our sample. Even when conservatively adjusting the frequency of diagnosed concussions by a factor of 5 to account for unreported/undiagnosed injuries, the PV+ of head impact indicators at any threshold was no greater than 1.94%.Although specificity and PV- appear high, the low PV+ would generate many unnecessary evaluations if these indicators were the sole diagnostic criteria. The clinical diagnostic value of head impact indicators is considerably questioned by these data. Notwithstanding, valid sensor technologies continue to offer objective data that have been used to improve player safety and reduce injury risk.","This paper examines the clinical utility of biomechanical head impact indicators in diagnosing concussions among football players by analyzing various thresholds of head impacts. The findings reveal that while the specificity and negative predictive value are high, the low positive predictive value casts significant doubt on the effectiveness of these indicators as standalone diagnostic tools, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in their application for player safety."

This was a cross-sectional survey of pediatric sports coaches in the United States designed to assess the impact of the CDC ""Heads Up!"" ""Heads Up!"" Concussion in Youth Sports is a free, online course available to coaches, parents, and others helping to keep athletes safe from concussions. The ""Heads Up!"" fact sheet provides important information on preventing, recognizing, and responding to a concussion. Half the cohort had heard of the CDC ""Heads Up!"" campaign. Fifty-five percent of the cohort thought that pediatric concussions in youth sports was a ""big deal"" (rated on a Likert scale from 1-10). Coaches who were also parents (58%) were significantly more likely to have heard of the campaign (P=0.0032, 95% CI=0.1153-0.5513). Having heard of the ""Heads Up!"" campaign was significantly associated with how important coaches thought pediatric concussions are (P=0.0133, 95% CI=0.0590-0.4960), as was higher income of the coaches (P=0.0100), and this was significantly correlated with the coach being more likely to call the athlete's parent at injury (P=0.0030, 95% CI=0.1160-0.5471). Coaches of football/soccer were significantly more likely to think pediatric concussions were a ""big deal"" (P=0.0021,95% CI=0.1374-0.5947). More than a third of coaches 35% reported that the ""Heads Up!"" campaign decreased the number of concussions on their team.","This study evaluates the awareness and impact of the CDC ""Heads Up!"" campaign among pediatric sports coaches regarding concussion prevention in youth sports. It reveals that while half of the coaches were aware of the guidelines, their recognition is linked to perceptions of concussion severity and changes in practice, with a significant number reporting a decrease in concussions attributed to the campaign."

Izquierdo","The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a jump training program, with or without haltere type handheld loading, on maximal intensity exercise performance. Youth soccer players (12.1±2.2 y) were assigned to either a jump training group (JG, n=21), a jump training group plus haltere type handheld loading (LJG, n=21), or a control group following only soccer training (CG, n=21). Athletes were evaluated for maximal-intensity performance measures before and after 6 weeks of training, during an in-season training period. The CG achieved a significant change in maximal kicking velocity only (ES=0.11–0.20). Both jump training groups improved in right leg (ES=0.28–0.45) and left leg horizontal countermovement jump with arms (ES=0.32–0.47), horizontal countermovement jump with arms (ES=0.28–0.37), vertical countermovement jump with arms (ES=0.26), 20-cm drop jump reactive strength index (ES=0.20–0.37), and maximal kicking velocity (ES=0.27–0.34). Nevertheless, compared to the CG, only the LJG exhibited greater improvements in all performance tests. Therefore, haltere type handheld loading further enhances performance adaptations during jump training in youth soccer players.","This study investigates the impact of jump training, with and without haltere type handheld loading, on the performance of youth soccer players. It finds that incorporating haltere type loading results in greater improvements in various performance metrics, including jumping ability and kicking velocity, compared to standard jump training alone."
Assessment of Gait Symmetry Improvements in National Athletes after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction during Rehabilitation,2016-08-23,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"M. Hadizadeh, S. Amri, S. Roohi, H. Mohafez","This study aimed to quantify changes in gait parameters and their symmetries among athletes with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions during a rehabilitation program. Twenty-two national players with ACL reconstructions and 15 healthy athletes were recruited. The gait data were collected between postoperative weeks 4-5, 8-9 and 12-13 using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. The spatio-temporal gait parameters and symmetry indexes (SIs) were evaluated for the patients and the control group. One-way and repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. The results demonstrated significant differences among spatio-temporal (P<0.001) and SIs (P=0.007) of patients for Test 1 and the control group. Repeated measure analysis revealed significant changes in the linear combinations of spatio-temporal gait variables (P=0.002) and SIs (P=0.043) over time. The injured limb's step length, cadence and weight acceptance time presented significant improvement across time (P<0.001). Moreover, the SI of the stance time was reduced significantly by 46.48% (P=0.004) among SI parameters. After three months, no significant differences were found between patients and healthy controls for the measured gait components (P>0.05). The rehabilitation program allowed national athletes to restore symmetry in spatio-temporal gait parameters toward the control group's range 12-13 weeks post-reconstruction.","This study evaluates gait symmetry improvements in national athletes undergoing rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Key findings indicate that significant enhancements in spatio-temporal gait parameters and symmetry indexes were observed over time, ultimately resulting in no substantial differences between patients and healthy controls by 12-13 weeks post-reconstruction."
Effects of horizontal plyometric training volume on soccer players’ performance,2016-08-22,Informa UK Limited,Research in Sports Medicine,"Javier Yanci, Asier Los Arcos, Jesús Camara, Daniel Castillo, Alberto García, Carlo Castagna","The aim of this study was to examine the dose response effect of strength and conditioning programmes, involving horizontally oriented plyometric exercises, on relevant soccer performance variables. Sixteen soccer players were randomly allocated to two 6-week plyometric training groups (G1 and G2) differing by imposed (twice a week) training volume. Post-training G1 (4.13%; d = 0.43) and G2 (2.45%; d = 0.53) moderately improved their horizontal countermovement jump performance. Significant between-group differences (p < 0.01) in the vertical countermovement jump for force production time (T2) were detected post-training. No significant and practical (p > 0.05, d = trivial or small) post-training improvements in sprint, change of direction ability (CODA) and horizontal arm swing countermovement jump were reported in either group. Horizontal plyometric training was effective in promoting improvement in injury prevention variables. Doubling the volume of a horizontal plyometric training protocol was shown to have no additional effect over functional aspects of soccer players' performance.","This study investigates the impact of different volumes of horizontal plyometric training on soccer performance metrics in players. Results indicate that while plyometric training improved specific jump performance, increasing the training volume did not enhance other functional abilities such as sprinting or change of direction."
Comparative Analysis of Head Impact in Contact and Collision Sports,2016-08-19,Mary Ann Liebert Inc,Journal of Neurotrauma,"Bryson B. Reynolds, James Patrie, Erich J. Henry, Howard P. Goodkin, Donna K. Broshek, Max Wintermark, T. Jason Druzgal","As concerns about head impact in American football have grown, similar concerns have started to extend to other sports thought to experience less head impact, such as soccer and lacrosse. However, the amount of head impact experienced in soccer and lacrosse is relatively unknown, particularly compared with the substantial amount of data from football. This pilot study quantifies and compares head impact from four different types of sports teams: college football, high school football, college soccer, and college lacrosse. During the 2013 and 2014 seasons, 61 players wore mastoid patch accelerometers to quantify head impact during official athletic events (i.e., practices and games). In both practices and games, college football players experienced the most or second-most impacts per athletic event, highest average peak resultant linear and rotational acceleration per impact, and highest cumulative linear and rotational acceleration per athletic event. For average peak resultant linear and rotational acceleration per individual impact, college football was followed by high school football, then college lacrosse, and then college soccer, with similar trends in both practices and games. In the four teams under study, college football players experienced a categorically higher burden of head impact. However, for cumulative impact burden, the high school football cohort was not significantly different from the college soccer cohort. The results suggest that head impact in sport substantially varies by both the type of sport (football vs. soccer vs. lacrosse) and level of play (college vs. high school).","This paper analyzes head impact across contact and collision sports, particularly focusing on football, soccer, and lacrosse. The findings indicate that college football players experience the highest levels of head impacts compared to their high school football, college lacrosse, and college soccer counterparts, with significant variations in impact burden based on sport type and level of play."

Ethnic Differences in Bony Hip Morphology in a Cohort of 445 Professional Male Soccer Players,2016-08-05,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Andrea B. Mosler, Kay M. Crossley, Jan H. Waarsing, Nabil Jomaah, Adam Weir, Per Hölmich, Rintje Agricola","Background: Participation in high-impact athletic activities has recently been associated with a higher prevalence of cam deformity. Bony hip morphology has also emerged as an important factor in the development of hip osteoarthritis. However, it is unknown whether bony morphology differs between ethnicities in athletes participating in high-impact sports. Purpose: To investigate whether the prevalence of specific bony hip morphological abnormalities differed between professional male soccer players of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Professional male soccer players from an entire league attending preparticipation screening were invited to participate in this study. Ethnicity was registered, and standardized radiographs of anteroposterior pelvic and Dunn views were obtained. Cam and pincer deformity, and acetabular dysplasia were quantified using the alpha angle, triangular index, and lateral center-edge angle (LCEA). Regression analyses with generalized estimating equations were used to determine prevalence differences in bony hip morphology. Results: A total of 445 male soccer players (890 hips; mean age ± SD, 25 ± 4.9 years) participated in the study, representing the following ethnic groups: Arabic (59%), black (24%), Persian (7%), white (6%), East Asian (2%), and other (2%). The prevalence of cam deformity (alpha angle &gt;60°) ranged from 57.5% to 71.7% across 4 of the groups, but East Asians had a significantly lower prevalence (18.8%; P ≤ .032). A large cam deformity (alpha angle &gt;78°) was more prevalent in white (33.3%) compared with black soccer players (17.8%; P = .041) and was absent in East Asian players. Pincer deformity (LCEA &gt;40°) was uncommon (3%) in all ethnicities. The prevalence of acetabular dysplasia (LCEA &lt;20°) ranged from 8.0% to 16.7%, apart from the white group, in which prevalence was only 1.9% ( P = .03). Conclusion: The prevalence of a cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia differed between ethnicities in this cohort of professional male soccer players. These findings suggest that there may be ethnic differences in both acetabular morphology and femoral bony response to athletic load.","This study investigates the prevalence of specific bony hip morphological abnormalities, such as cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia, among 445 professional male soccer players from diverse ethnic backgrounds.

Scientific evidence is just the starting point: A generalizable process for developing sports injury prevention interventions,2016-08-04,Elsevier BV,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Alex Donaldson, David G. Lloyd, Belinda J. Gabbe, Jill Cook, Warren Young, Peta White, Caroline F. Finch","The 2 most cited sports injury prevention research frameworks incorporate intervention development, yet little guidance is available in the sports science literature on how to undertake this complex process. This paper presents a generalizable process for developing implementable sports injury prevention interventions, including a case study applying the process to develop a lower limb injury prevention exercise training program (FootyFirst) for community Australian football.The intervention development process is underpinned by 2 complementary premises: (1) that evidence-based practice integrates the best available scientific evidence with practitioner expertise and end user values and (2) that research evidence alone is insufficient to develop implementable interventions.The generalizable 6-step intervention development process involves (1) compiling research evidence, clinical experience, and knowledge of the implementation context; (2) consulting with experts; (3) engaging with end users; (4) testing the intervention; (5) using theory; and (6) obtaining feedback from early implementers. Following each step, intervention content and presentation should be revised to ensure that the final intervention includes evidence-informed content that is likely to be adopted, properly implemented, and sustained over time by the targeted intervention deliverers. For FootyFirst, this process involved establishing a multidisciplinary intervention development group, conducting 2 targeted literature reviews, undertaking an online expert consensus process, conducting focus groups with program end users, testing the program multiple times in different contexts, and obtaining feedback from early implementers of the program.This systematic yet pragmatic and iterative intervention development process is potentially applicable to any injury prevention topic across all sports settings and levels. It will guide researchers wishing to undertake intervention development.","This paper outlines a systematic six-step process for developing implementable sports injury prevention interventions, demonstrated through the creation of the FootyFirst program for lower limb injury prevention in Australian football.

Hamstring Architectural and Functional Adaptations Following Long vs. Short Muscle Length Eccentric Training,2016-08-03,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Kenny Guex, Francis Degache, Cynthia Morisod, Matthieu Sailly, Gregoire P. Millet","Most common preventive eccentric-based exercises, such as Nordic hamstring do not include any hip flexion. So, the elongation stress reached is lower than during the late swing phase of sprinting. The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of hamstring architectural (fascicle length and pennation angle) and functional (concentric and eccentric optimum angles and concentric and eccentric peak torques) parameters following a 3-week eccentric resistance program performed at long (LML) vs. short muscle length (SML). Both groups performed eight sessions of 3-5 × 8 slow maximal eccentric knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer: the SML group at 0° and the LML group at 80° of hip flexion. Architectural parameters were measured using ultrasound imaging and functional parameters using the isokinetic dynamometer. The fascicle length increased by 4.9% (p < 0.01, medium effect size) in the SML and by 9.3% (p < 0.001, large effect size) in the LML group. The pennation angle did not change (p = 0.83) in the SML and tended to decrease by 0.7° (p = 0.09, small effect size) in the LML group. The concentric optimum angle tended to decrease by 8.8° (p = 0.09, medium effect size) in the SML and by 17.3° (p < 0.01, large effect size) in the LML group. The eccentric optimum angle did not change (p = 0.19, small effect size) in the SML and tended to decrease by 10.7° (p = 0.06, medium effect size) in the LML group. The concentric peak torque did not change in the SML (p = 0.37) and the LML (p = 0.23) groups, whereas eccentric peak torque increased by 12.9% (p < 0.01, small effect size) and 17.9% (p < 0.001, small effect size) in the SML and the LML group, respectively. No group-by-time interaction was found for any parameters. A correlation was found between the training-induced change in fascicle length and the change in concentric optimum angle (r = -0.57, p < 0.01). These results suggest that performing eccentric exercises lead to several architectural and functional adaptations. However, further investigations are required to confirm the hypothesis that performing eccentric exercises at LML may lead to greater adaptations than a similar training performed at SML.","The paper investigates the effects of eccentric resistance training at long (LML) versus short muscle length (SML) on hamstring muscle architecture and function. The results indicate that LML training significantly increased fascicle length and eccentric peak torque compared to SML training, suggesting that different muscle lengths during training may elicit varying adaptations in hamstring muscles."
Fluoromicrometry: A Method for Measuring Muscle Length Dynamics with Biplanar Videofluoroscopy,2016-08-01,Wiley,Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological Genetics and Physiology,"Ariel L. Camp, Henry C. Astley, Angela M. Horner, Thomas J. Roberts, Elizabeth L. Brainerd","Accurate measurements of muscle length changes are essential for understanding the biomechanics of musculoskeletal systems, and can provide insights into muscular work, force, and power. Muscle length has typically been measured in vivo using sonomicrometry, a method that measures distances by sending and receiving sound pulses between piezoelectric crystals. Here, we evaluate an alternative method, fluoromicrometry, which measures muscle length changes over time by tracking the three-dimensional positions of implanted, radio-opaque markers via biplanar videofluoroscopy. To determine the accuracy and precision of fluoromicrometry, we simultaneously measured length changes of an isolated muscle, the frog sartorius, in an in vitro setup using both fluoromicrometry and a servomotor. For fluoromicrometry to perfectly match the results of the servomotor, the relationship between the two measurements should be linear, with a slope of 1. Measurements of muscle shortening from fluoromicrometry and the motor were compared across 11 isotonic contractions. The precision of fluoromicrometry was ±0.09 mm, measured as the root mean square error of the regression of fluoromicrometry versus servomotor muscle lengths. Fluoromicrometry was also accurate: the mean slope of the fluoromicrometry–servomotor regressions did not differ significantly from the ideal line once off-axis motion was removed. Thus, fluoromicrometry provides a useful alternative for measuring muscle length, especially in studies of live animals, as it permits long-term marker implantation, wireless data collection, and increased spatial sampling. Fluoromicrometry can also be used with X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology to simultaneously measure muscle shortening and skeletal kinematics, providing a potent new tool for biomechanics research.","The paper presents fluoromicrometry as an innovative method for measuring muscle length dynamics using biplanar videofluoroscopy, which offers advantages over traditional sonomicrometry. It demonstrates that fluoromicrometry is both accurate and precise for tracking muscle length changes, making it a valuable tool for biomechanics research, particularly in live animals."

Specifically, we hypothesized that a priori selected biomechanical and neuromuscular factors would characterize participants into distinct at-risk profiles.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 624 female athletes who participated in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports underwent testing before their competitive season. During testing, athletes performed drop-jump tasks from which biomechanical measures were captured. Using data from these tasks, latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted to identify distinct profiles based on preintervention biomechanical and neuromuscular measures. As a validation, we examined whether the profile membership was a significant predictor of the KAM.LPA using 6 preintervention biomechanical measures selected a priori resulted in 3 distinct profiles, including a low (profile 1), moderate (profile 2), and high (profile 3) risk for ACL injuries. Athletes with profiles 2 and 3 had a significantly higher KAM compared with those with profile 1 (P < .05).This is the first study to use LPA of biomechanical landing data to create ACL injury risk profiles.

Exposure and injuries data from 1 448 players over 6 consecutive seasons were collected from a media-based register. In total, 3 358 injuries were documented. The incidence rate for match and training injuries was 11.5 per 1 000 match-hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.9–12.2), and 61.4 per 100 player-seasons (95% CI: 58.8–64.1), respectively. Strains (30.3%) and sprains (16.7%) were the major injury types, with the latter causing significantly longer lay-off times than the former. Significant differences between the playing positions were found regarding injury incidence and injury burden (lay-off time per incidence-rate), with wing-defenders sustaining significantly lower incidence-rates of groin injuries compared to forwards (rate ratio: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.17–0.96). Wing-midfielders had the highest incidence-rate and injury burden from match injuries, whereas central-defenders sustained the highest incidence-rate and injury burden from training injuries. There were also significant differences in match availability due to an injury across the playing positions, with midfielders sustaining the highest unavailability rates from a match and training injury. Injury-risk and patterns seem to vary substantially between different playing positions.

Forty-seven elite junior soccer players (age 17.7 ± 0.5 years, height 175.3 ± 3.6 cm, body mass 68.1 ± 7.4 kg) were randomized into 1 of 3 groups, the NHE group (n = 16), RB group (n = 15), or the control group (CG) (n = 16). The eccentric training intervention consisted of 27 supervised training sessions over 10 weeks. Within-group analysis showed significant improvements (p < 0.001) in right SLHB (+25.52% for NHE and +18.33% for RB) and left SLHB (+28.92% for NHE and +20.08% for RB) from pretest to posttest in NHE and RB. However, no significant pre-post changes were observed for the CG in any variable. In addition, a significant time effect (p = 0.028) was also observed for NHE in bilateral asymmetry decreasing from pre- to posttest. In the between-groups analysis, significant better results were found in right SLHB and left SLHB, in the NHE group and RB group in comparison with CG. However, there were no differences between the eccentric training groups (NHE vs. RB). The RB seems to be a viable alternative to the NHE to developing posterior lower-limb muscle strength based on SLHB.","This study evaluates the impact of two eccentric training exercises, the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) and Russian belt (RB) training, on lower-limb muscle strength and bilateral asymmetry in elite junior soccer players. Results indicate significant strength improvements in both training groups compared to the control group, with both NHE and RB being effective for enhancing posterior lower-limb muscle strength without notable differences between the two training methods."

A Novel mass-spring-damper model analysis to identify landing deficits in athletes returning to sport after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. J Strength Cond Res 31(9): 2590-2598, 2017-A mass-spring-damper (MSD) model may serve as an extension of biomechanical data from 3-dimensional motion analysis and epidemiological data which helps to delineate populations at risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate such a model. Thirty-six ACL reconstruction (ACLR) group subjects and 67 controls (CTRL) completed single-leg drop landing and single-leg broad jump tasks. Landing ground reaction force data were collected and analyzed with an MSD model. Medians, interquartile ranges, and limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated and comparisons were made within and between groups. During a single-leg drop landing, the ACLR group had a lower spring LSI than the CTRL group (p = 0.015) and landed with decreased stiffness in the involved limb relative to the uninvolved limb (p = 0.021). The ACLR group also had an increased damping LSI relative to the CTRL group (p = 0.045). The ACLR subjects landed with increased stiffness (p = 0.006) and decreased damping (p = 0.003) in their involved limbs compared to CTRL subjects' nondominant limbs. During a single-leg forward broad jump, the ACLR group had a greater spring LSI value than the CTRL group (p = 0.045). The CTRL group also recorded decreased damping values in their nondominant limbs compared with the involved limbs of the ACLR group (p = 0.046). Athletes who have undergone ACLR display different lower-limb dynamics than healthy controls, according to an MSD model. Quadriceps dominance and leg dominance are components of ACLR athletes' landing strategies and may be identified with an MSD model and addressed during rehabilitation.","This paper presents a novel mass-spring-damper (MSD) model to analyze the landing mechanics of athletes recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction compared to healthy controls. Key findings indicate differences in lower-limb dynamics, including reduced stiffness and increased damping in the involved limbs of ACLR athletes, highlighting the potential for the MSD model to identify landing deficits and inform rehabilitation strategies."
The Effects of Helmet Weight on Hybrid III Head and Neck Responses by Comparing Unhelmeted and Helmeted Impacts,2016-07-26,ASME International,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,"Ron Jadischke, David C. Viano, Joe McCarthy, Albert I. King","Most studies on football helmet performance focus on lowering head acceleration-related parameters to reduce concussions. This has resulted in an increase in helmet size and mass. The objective of this paper was to study the effect of helmet mass on head and upper neck responses. Two independent test series were conducted. In test series one, 90 pendulum impact tests were conducted with four different headform and helmet conditions: unhelmeted Hybrid III headform, Hybrid III headform with a football helmet shell, Hybrid III headform with helmet shell and facemask, and Hybrid III headform with the helmet and facemask with mass added to the shell (n = 90). The Hybrid III neck was used for all the conditions. For all the configurations combined, the shell only, shell and facemask, and weighted helmet conditions resulted in 36%, 43%, and 44% lower resultant head accelerations (p < 0.0001), respectively, when compared to the unhelmeted condition. Head delta-V reductions were 1.1%, 4.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. In contrast, the helmeted conditions resulted in 26%, 41%, and 49% higher resultant neck forces (p < 0.0001), respectively. The increased neck forces were dominated by neck tension. In test series two, testing was conducted with a pneumatic linear impactor (n = 178). Fourteen different helmet makes and models illustrate the same trend. The increased neck forces provide a possible explanation as to why there has not been a corresponding reduction in concussion rates despite improvements in helmets ability to reduce head accelerations.","This paper investigates the impact of helmet weight on head and upper neck responses during collisions, revealing that while increased helmet mass effectively reduces head accelerations, it concurrently raises resultant neck forces. The findings suggest a complex relationship between helmet design and injury prevention, as higher neck forces may contribute to unchanged concussion rates despite advancements in helmet technology."
"Longitudinal Changes in Hip Strength and Range of Motion in Female Youth Soccer Players: Implications for ACL Injury, A Pilot Study",2016-07-21,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Anh-Dung Nguyen, Emma F. Zuk, Andrea L. Baellow, Kate R. Pfile, Lindsay J. DiStefano, Michelle C. Boling","Risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in young female athletes increases with age, appearing to peak during maturation. Changes in hip muscle strength and range of motion (ROM) during this time may contribute to altered dynamic movement patterns that are known to increase risk of ACL injuries. Understanding the longitudinal changes in hip strength and ROM is needed to develop appropriate interventions to reduce the risk of ACL injuries.To examine the longitudinal changes in hip strength and ROM in female youth soccer players.Longitudinal descriptive study.Field setting.14 female youth soccer athletes (14.1 ± 1.1 y, 165.8 ± 5.3 cm, 57.5 ± 9.9 kg) volunteered as part of a multiyear risk factor screening project.Clinical measures of hip strength and ROM were collected annually over 3 consecutive years. Passive hip internal rotation (IR), external rotation (ER), abduction (ABD), and adduction (ADD) ROM were measured with a digital inclinometer. Isometric hip ABD and extension (EXT) strength were evaluated using a hand-held dynamometer. Separate repeated-measures ANOVAs compared hip strength and ROM values across 3 consecutive years (P < .05).As youth female soccer players increased in age, there were no changes in normalized hip ABD (P = .830) or EXT strength (P = .062) across 3 consecutive years. Longitudinal changes in hip ROM were observed with increases in hip IR (P = .001) and ABD (P < .001), while hip ADD (P = .009) and ER (P < .001) decreased.Anatomical changes at the hip occur as youth female soccer players increase in age. While there are no changes in hip strength, there is an increase in hip IR and ABD ROM with a concomitant decrease in hip ER and ADD ROM. The resulting asymmetries in hip ROM may decrease the activation and force producing capabilities of the hip muscles during dynamic activities, contributing to altered lower extremity mechanics known to increase the risk of ACL injuries.","This study examines longitudinal changes in hip strength and range of motion in female youth soccer players and their potential implications for ACL injury risk. The findings indicate that while hip strength remains stable, there are significant changes in hip range of motion, with increased internal rotation and abduction accompanied by decreases in external rotation and adduction, potentially impacting lower extremity mechanics and injury risk."

The morphologic characteristics and range of motion in the hips of athletes and non-athletes,2016-07-15,Oxford University Press (OUP),Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery,"Páll Jónasson, Olof Thoreson, Mikael Sansone, Karin Svensson, Anna Swärd, Jon Karlsson, Adad Baranto","The cam deformity may cause impingement and probably leads to osteoarthritis of the hip. The aetiology of the cam deformity is incompletely understood. Vigorous training during skeletal growth can lead to the development of cam and symptoms of femoro-acetabular impingement and subsequent osteoarthritis of the hip. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiographic characteristics and range of motion between a group of athletes and a non-athletic control group. Thirty-two male athletes (17 soccer players and 15 ice-hockey players) and thirty non-athletes, used as a control group, were examined clinically and radiographically. Hip range of motion was measured and the FADIR and FABER tests were performed. Standard radiographs of both hips were taken. The centre-edge angle, alpha angle, caput-collum-diaphysis angle, head-neck offset and Tönnis grade were registered. The athletes had a higher Tönnis grade (right P = 0.009, left P = 0.004), more pain on the FADIR test (right P = 0.006, left P = 0.001) and lower ROM in internal (right P = 0.003, left P = 0.025) and external rotation (P < 0.001). A superiorly placed cam deformity (seen on an AP pelvis view) was correlated with reduced external rotation (right P = 0.001, left P = 0.004) and mild osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 1), (P = 0.015, left P = 0.020), while a more anteriorly placed cam deformity (seen on a modified Lauenstein view) was correlated with reduced internal rotation (right P = 0.029, left P = 0.013).

How do training and competition workloads relate to injury? The workload—injury aetiology model,2016-07-14,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Johann Windt, Tim J Gabbett","Injury aetiology models that have evolved over the previous two decades highlight a number of factors which contribute to the causal mechanisms for athletic injuries. These models highlight the pathway to injury, including (1) internal risk factors (eg, age, neuromuscular control) which predispose athletes to injury, (2) exposure to external risk factors (eg, playing surface, equipment), and finally (3) an inciting event, wherein biomechanical breakdown and injury occurs. The most recent aetiological model proposed in 2007 was the first to detail the dynamic nature of injury risk, whereby participation may or may not result in injury, and participation itself alters injury risk through adaptation. However, although training and competition workloads are strongly associated with injury, existing aetiology models neither include them nor provide an explanation for how workloads alter injury risk. Therefore, we propose an updated injury aetiology model which includes the effects of workloads. Within this model, internal risk factors are differentiated into modifiable and non-modifiable factors, and workloads contribute to injury in three ways: (1) exposure to external risk factors and potential inciting events, (2) fatigue, or negative physiological effects, and (3) fitness, or positive physiological adaptations. Exposure is determined solely by total load, while positive and negative adaptations are controlled both by total workloads, as well as changes in load (eg, the acute:chronic workload ratio). Finally, we describe how this model explains the load-injury relationships for total workloads, acute:chronic workload ratios and the training load-injury paradox.","This paper proposes an updated injury aetiology model that incorporates training and competition workloads as significant factors influencing injury risk in athletes. It highlights the dynamic nature of injury risk through internal (modifiable and non-modifiable) and external risk factors, and explains how workload affects injury through exposure to risk factors, fatigue, and fitness adaptations."
Light-load maximal lifting velocity full squat training program improves important physical and skill characteristics in futsal players,2016-07-14,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Julio Torres-Torrelo, David Rodríguez-Rosell, Juan José González-Badillo","This study aimed to compare the effect of 6 weeks of resistance training or combined resistance training and change of direction exercises on physical performance and motor skills in futsal players. Thirty-four futsal players were divided into full squat group (SG, n = 12), combined full squat and change of direction exercises group (S+CDG, n = 12) and control group (CG, n = 10). The resistance training for SG consisted of full squat with low load (~45-58% 1RM) and low volume (4-6 repetitions), whereas the S+CDG performed the same resistance training program combined with loaded change of direction. Sprint time in 10 and 20 m, change of direction test, countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) height, maximal strength and force-velocity relationship in full squat exercise, kicking speed ball (BSmean) and repeated sprint ability (RSAmean) were selected as testing variables. Both experimental groups showed significant improvements for CMJ, BSmean and all strength parameters. Only SG resulted in significant sprint gains, whereas S+CDG also achieved significant improvements in RSAmean. The CG remained unchanged after training period. No significant differences were found between both experimental groups. These findings suggest that only 12 sessions of either lightweight resistance training alone, lifting the load at maximal intended velocity or combined with change of direction exercises is enough to improve several physical and skills capacities critical to futsal performance in adult players.","This study evaluates the effects of a 6-week training program combining resistance training and change of direction exercises on the physical performance and motor skills of futsal players.

Can subjective comfort be used as a measure of plantar pressure in football boots?,2016-07-11,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Katrine Okholm Kryger, Vicky Jarratt, Séan Mitchell, Steph Forrester","Comfort has been shown to be the most desired football boot feature by players. Previous studies have shown discomfort to be related to increased plantar pressures for running shoes which, in some foot regions, has been suggested to be a causative factor in overuse injuries. This study examined the correlation between subjective comfort data and objective plantar pressure for football boots during football-specific drills. Eight male university football players were tested. Plantar pressure data were collected during four football-specific movements for each of three different football boots. The global and local peak pressures based on a nine-sectioned foot map were compared to subjective comfort measures recorded using a visual analogue scale for global discomfort and a discomfort foot map for local discomfort. A weak (rs = -0.126) yet significant (P < 0.05) correlation was shown between the peak plantar pressure experienced and the visual analogue scale rated comfort. The model only significantly predicted (P > 0.001) the outcome for two (medial and lateral forefoot) of the nine foot regions. Subjective comfort data is therefore not a reliable measure of increased plantar pressures for any foot region. The use of plantar pressure measures is therefore needed to optimise injury prevention when designing studded footwear.","This paper investigates the relationship between subjective comfort and objective plantar pressure in football boots during specific drills. The study finds a weak correlation between peak plantar pressures and self-reported comfort, suggesting that relying on subjective comfort data alone is insufficient for assessing plantar pressures, highlighting the importance of objective measures in footwear design for injury prevention."

J Strength Cond Res 31(8): 2119–2130, 2017—Team-based neuromuscular training programs for injury prevention have been tested primarily in female and adolescent athletes in soccer, handball, and basketball with limited research in adult male field sports. This study explored whether the GAA 15, a multifaceted 8-week neuromuscular training program developed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), could improve risk factors for lower limb injury in male Gaelic footballers and hurlers. Four Gaelic sports collegiate teams were randomized into intervention or control groups. Two teams ( n = 41), one football and one hurling, were allocated to the intervention, undertaking a 15 minutes program of neuromuscular training exercises at the start of team training sessions, twice weekly for 8 weeks. Two matched teams ( n = 37) acted as controls, participating in usual team training. Lower extremity stability (Y-Balance test [YBT]) and jump-landing technique using the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) were assessed preintervention and postintervention. There were moderate effect sizes in favor of the intervention for right ( d = 0.59) and left ( d = 0.69) composite YBT scores, with adjusted mean differences between intervention and control of 3.85 ± 0.91% and 4.34 ± 0.92% for right and left legs, respectively ( p &lt; 0.001). There was a greater reduction in the mean LESS score in favor of the intervention group after exercise training (Cohen's d = 0.72, adjusted mean difference 2.49 ± 0.54, p &lt; 0.001). Clinically and statistically significant improvements in dynamic balance and jump-landing technique occurred in collegiate level Gaelic football and hurling players who adopted the GAA 15, when compared with usual training. These findings support application and evaluation of the GAA 15 in other player groups within the Gaelic games playing population.","This paper investigates the impact of the Gaelic Athletic Association 15 training program on neuromuscular outcomes among male Gaelic football and hurling players. The randomized cluster trial demonstrates that the program significantly improves lower extremity stability and jump-landing technique compared to usual team training, underscoring its potential for injury prevention in this athlete population."
Aerial Rotation Effects on Vertical Jump Performance Among Highly Skilled Collegiate Soccer Players,2016-07-09,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Leland A. Barker, John R. Harry, Janet S. Dufek, John A. Mercer","Barker, LA, Harry, JR, Dufek, JS, and Mercer, JA. Aerial rotation effects on vertical jump performance among highly skilled collegiate soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 932-938, 2017-In soccer matches, jumps involving rotations occur when attempting to head the ball for a shot or pass from set pieces, such as corner kicks, goal kicks, and lob passes. However, the 3-dimensional ground reaction forces used to perform rotational jumping tasks are currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare bilateral, 3-dimensional, and ground reaction forces of a standard countermovement jump (CMJ0) with those of a countermovement jump with a 180° rotation (CMJ180) among Division-1 soccer players. Twenty-four participants from the soccer team of the University of Nevada performed 3 trials of CMJ0 and CMJ180. Dependent variables included jump height, downward and upward phase times, vertical (Fz) peak force and net impulse relative to mass, and medial-lateral and anterior-posterior force couple values. Statistical significance was set a priori at α = 0.05. CMJ180 reduced jump height, increased the anterior-posterior force couple in the downward and upward phases, and increased upward peak Fz (p ≤ 0.05). All other variables were not significantly different between groups (p > 0.05). However, we did recognize that downward peak Fz trended lower in the CMJ0 condition (p = 0.059), and upward net impulse trended higher in the CMJ0 condition (p = 0.071). It was concluded that jump height was reduced during the rotational jumping task, and rotation occurred primarily via AP ground reaction forces through the entire countermovement jump. Coaches and athletes may consider additional rotational jumping in their training programs to mediate performance decrements during rotational jump tasks.","This paper investigates the effects of aerial rotation on vertical jump performance in highly skilled collegiate soccer players, specifically comparing standard and rotational countermovement jumps. The study finds that while rotational jumps reduce jump height and alter ground reaction forces, the results suggest that incorporating rotational jumping into training may help athletes manage performance declines during such tasks."
Agility in Young Athletes: Is It a Different Ability From Speed and Power?,2016-07-06,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,"Yassine Negra, Helmi Chaabene, Mehréz Hammami, Samiha Amara, Senda Sammoud, Bessem Mkaouer, Younés Hachana","Negra, Y, Chaabene, H, Hammami, M, Amara, S, Sammoud, S, Mkaouer, B, and Hachana, Y. Agility in young athletes: is it a different ability from speed and power? J Strength Cond Res 31(3): 727-735, 2017-Agility is an important physical attribute for successful participation in team sports events. Illinois agility test (IAT) and T-test have been widely used within adult team sports players to assess agility performance. The purposes of this investigation are (a) to study the reliability and the sensitivity of both IAT and T-test scores and (b) to explore to what extend the agility is an independent physical ability from speed time and jumping ability. Competitive-level young soccer (n = 95) and handball players (n = 92) participated in this study (i.e., approximately 12 years old). Reliability analyses were established by determining intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(3,1)) and typical error of measurement (TEM). The sensitivity of agility tests was revealed by comparing TEM to the value of the smallest worthwhile change (SWC). The second aim was examined by means of the principal component analysis. Results revealed that the scores of both IAT and T-test showed a high reliability (all ICC(3,1) > 0.90 and TEM < 5%) and sensitivity (all TEM < SWC). Principal component analysis resulted in one significant component for the soccer and handball group each that explained 72.18 and 80.16% of the total variance, respectively. Significant relationships were recorded between all the selected tests (r = -0.72 to 0.85, p < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that both IAT and T-test provided reliable and sensitive scores. Therefore, these tests could be strongly recommended to evaluate agility within young male competitive-level team sports athletes. In addition, it seems that agility, speed time, and jumping ability assess the same physical attribute in young competitive-level team sports players.","The paper investigates the reliability and sensitivity of the Illinois Agility Test (IAT) and T-test in assessing agility in young athletes, specifically targeting competitive-level soccer and handball players. Results confirm that both tests are reliable and sensitive measures, and the analysis suggests that agility is closely related to speed time and jumping ability, indicating they may assess the same physical attribute in this age group."
Football Players' Head-Impact Exposure After Limiting of Full-Contact Practices,2016-07-01,National Athletic Trainers' Association,Journal of Athletic Training,"Steven P. Broglio, Richelle M. Williams, Kathryn L. O'Connor, Jason Goldstick","Context: Sporting organizations limit full-contact football practices to reduce concussion risk and based on speculation that repeated head impacts may result in long-term neurodegeneration. Objective: To directly compare head-impact exposure in high school football players before and after a statewide restriction on full-contact practices. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: High school football field. Patients or Other Participants: Participants were varsity football athletes from a single high school. Before the rule change, 26 athletes (age = 16.2 ± 0.8 years, height = 179.6 ± 6.4 cm, weight = 81.9 ± 13.1 kg) participated. After the rule change, 24 athletes (age = 15.9 ± 0.8 years, height = 178.3 ± 6.5 cm, weight = 76.2 ± 11.6 kg) participated. Nine athletes participated in both years of the investigation. Main Outcome Measure(s): Head-impact exposure was monitored using the Head Impact Telemetry System while the athletes participated in football games and practices in the seasons before and after the rule change. Head-impact frequency, location, and magnitude (ie, linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and Head Impact Telemetry severity profile [HITsp], respectively) were measured. Results: A total of 15 398 impacts (592 impacts per player per season) were captured before the rule change and 8269 impacts (345 impacts per player per season) after the change. An average 42% decline in impact exposure occurred across all players, with practice-exposure declines occurring among linemen (46% decline); receivers, cornerbacks, and safeties (41% decline); and tight ends, running backs (including fullbacks), and linebackers (39% decline). Impact magnitudes remained largely unchanged between the years. Conclusions: A rule change limiting full-contact high school football practices appears to have been effective in reducing head-impact exposure across all players, with the largest reduction occurring among linemen. This finding is likely associated with the rule modification, particularly because the coaching staff and offensive scheme remained consistent, yet how this reduction influences concussion risk and long-term cognitive health remains unknown.","This paper investigates the impact of a statewide rule change that limited full-contact practices in high school football on players' head-impact exposure.

Hamstring and Gluteal Muscle Activation During the Assessment of Dynamic Movements,2016-07-01,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Athletic Therapy and Training,"Gretchen D. Oliver, Audrey Stone, Jessica Washington","Recently, sports medicine professionals have shown interest in using dynamic movement assessments to help identify biomechanical risk factors for musculoskeletal injury. Thus the purpose of this study was to propose two movements (single leg step down and single leg lateral hop) that could predict injury and determine if these proposed movements elicited muscle activation of the hamstrings and gluteals. Surface electromyography was employed and muscle activations of the hamstrings and gluteus medius muscles were classified as strong during both the single leg step down (SLSD) and single leg lateral hop (SLLH). Both the hamstrings and gluteus medius muscles are associated with musculoskeletal injury. The SLSD and SLLH cause significantly high muscle activation of both these muscle groups and should be considered for use in dynamic movement assessments.","This study investigates the activation of hamstring and gluteal muscles during dynamic movement assessments, specifically focusing on the single leg step down and single leg lateral hop.

Preseason Aerobic Capacity Is an Independent Predictor of In-Season Injury in Collegiate Soccer Players,2016-06-26,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Andrew Watson, Jacob Brindle, Stacey Brickson, Tyler Allee, Jennifer Sanfilippo","Purpose: To determine whether preseason aerobic capacity is independently associated with in-season injury among collegiate soccer players. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: University athletic department. Participants: Forty-three NCAA Division I soccer athletes (male = 23). Independent Variables: Gender and preseason lean body mass (LBM), body fat percentage (BF%), and maximal aerobic capacity (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max). Main Outcome Measures: In-season injuries were recorded during the season, and body composition and fitness variables were compared between injured and uninjured players. Multivariate regression models were developed to predict injury during the entire season and during the first 4 weeks of the season. Results: Thirty-five injuries among 25 players were recorded during the season. Players injured at any point during the season had lower V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (57.7 vs 63.4 mL·kg−1·min−1, P = 0.014) and Tmax (15.8 vs 17.2 minutes, P = 0.035), compared with uninjured players, but no differences were noted in age, gender, LBM, or BF%. Players injured during the first 4 weeks of the season had lower LBM (49.7 vs 56.0 kg, P = 0.038) and Tmax (15.1 vs 16.7 minutes, P = 0.043) than uninjured players. For injuries occurring throughout the entire season, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max was an independent predictor of injury (P = 0.043), whereas gender, LBM, and BF% were not. During the first 4 weeks of the season, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (P = 0.035) and LBM (P = 0.049) were related to injury, whereas gender and BF% were not. Conclusions: Aerobic fitness is an independent predictor of in-season injury. Early-season injuries are related to aerobic fitness and LBM. Clinical Relevance: Efforts to increase aerobic capacity and LBM among soccer players in the off-season may help reduce in-season injury.","The paper investigates the relationship between preseason aerobic capacity and in-season injuries in collegiate soccer players, highlighting that lower maximal aerobic capacity (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max) and lean body mass (LBM) are associated with a higher incidence of injuries.

At baseline, we recorded player demographics, playing and ACL injury history, and measured peak concentric isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring torques (60°·s), hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, isometric hip abduction strength, and one-repetition maximum in a seated leg press. We followed a predefined statistical protocol where we generated five separate logistic regression models, one for each of the proposed strength risk factors and adjusted for confounding factors. New ACL injury was the outcome, using the leg as the unit of analysis.A total of 57 (6.6%) of 867 players (age = 21 ± 4 yr, height = 170 ± 6 cm, body mass = 66 ± 8 kg) suffered from a noncontact ACL injury after baseline testing (1.8 ± 1.8 yr). The OR of sustaining a new injury among those with an ACL injury history was 3.1 (95% confidence interval = 1.6-6.1). None of the five strength variables selected were statistically associated with an increased risk of ACL rupture when adjusted for sport, dominant leg, ACL injury history, and height.Peak lower extremity strength was not associated with an increased ACL injury risk among female elite handball and football players.

Biomechanical Analysis of the Effects of Bilateral Hinged Knee Bracing,2016-06-16,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Hangil Lee, Dokyeong Ha, Yeoun-Seung Kang, Hyung-Soon Park","This research analyzed the effect of bilateral hinged knee braces on a healthy knee from a biomechanical frame in vivo. This was accomplished by fitting a knee brace with two customized wireless force/torque (F/T) sensors that could readily record force and torque during live motion, while the kinetics at the knee were computed using the inverse dynamics of the motion capture and force plate data. Four tasks to test the brace's effects were drop vertical jumping, pivoting, stop vertical jumping, and cutting. The results showed that the hinges in the knee brace can absorb up to 18% of the force and 2.7% of the torque at the knee during various athletic motions. Thus, the hinges demonstrated minimal effect in reducing the mechanical load on the knee. There were limitations concerning the consistency of the motions performed by the subjects during the trials and the influence of the other portions of the brace to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the brace as a whole. Future works may incorporate a fatigue protocol and injured subjects to better determine the effects of the brace. There is still a need for more research on the biomechanical influence of knee braces to develop safer and more effective products.","This study investigates the effects of bilateral hinged knee braces on healthy knees through a biomechanical analysis, utilizing customized wireless force/torque sensors during athletic tasks.

Few studies have analyzed the role of a combination of osseous morphologic characteristics in matched case control studies. The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between osseous morphologic characteristics and ACL injury in male college American-football players.Ninety male U.S. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division-I college football players who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for a knee injury between 2005 and 2014 were included. Subjects with an ACL injury (ACL-injured group) were matched for age, height, weight, and body mass index to subjects without an ACL injury (control group). Several osseous morphologic characteristics including medial and lateral condylar width, medial and lateral plateau width, notch width, bicondylar width, notch width index, and medial and lateral tibial slopes were measured and were compared between groups. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Significance was set at p < 0.05.According to univariable analysis, a narrower lateral femoral condyle (odds ratio, 0.82 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.68 to 0.97]), increased medial tibial plateau slope (odds ratio, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.85]), and increased lateral tibial plateau slope (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.15 to 1.78]) were significantly associated with ACL injury. Multivariable analysis revealed that increased lateral tibial slope (odds ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.70]) was the sole independent predictor of ACL injury.Based on this study, osseous morphology, specifically increased lateral tibial slope, is associated with ACL injury in male college football players.

Current ACL injury risk screening methods are yet to be evaluated for their ability to identify athletes' who exhibit high‐risk lower limb mechanics during sport‐specific maneuvers associated with ACL injury occurrences. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of two ACL injury risk screening methods in identifying high‐risk lower limb mechanics during a sport‐specific landing task. Thirty‐two female athletes were screened using the Landing Error Scoring System ( LESS ) and Tuck Jump Assessment. Participants' also completed a sport‐specific landing task, during which three‐dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected. One‐dimensional statistical parametric mapping was used to examine the relationships between screening method scores, and the three‐dimensional hip and knee joint rotation and moment data from the sport‐specific landing. Higher LESS scores were associated with reduced knee flexion from 30 to 57 ms after initial contact ( P = 0.003) during the sport‐specific landing; however, no additional relationships were found.

Outcome measures were determined in 18 youth players (age 14.4 ± 0.5 years; stature 169.4 ± 9.9 cm; mass 59.3 ± 8.9 kg; maturity offset 0.86 ± 0.88 years) pre and post simulated soccer match play (SAFT90 ). There was no fatigue-related change in the H/QFUNC ; however, reactive strength and leg stiffness were both compromised (P < 0.001) after soccer-specific fatigue. Muscle activation was also locally compromised (P < 0.001) in the medial hamstring and quadriceps but not in the lateral muscles. Where statistically significant changes were observed, the effect sizes ranged from small to large (0.33-0.97). Compromised stiffness when fatigue is present suggests an increased yielding action, greater ground contact times, greater center of mass displacement, and less efficient movement when the limb comes into contact with the ground. This combined with a reduction in medial quadriceps muscle activation may reflect poor kinetic chain control at the hip and an increase in knee injury risk.","This paper investigates the impact of soccer-specific fatigue on neuromuscular control and injury risk mechanisms in elite male youth soccer players. The study found that while the functional hamstring/quadriceps ratio remained unchanged, soccer-specific fatigue led to significant compromises in reactive strength, leg stiffness, and muscle activation, potentially increasing knee injury risk."

The aim of this study is to develop and validate the Football Turf Performance Questionnaire which measures the performance of an artificial turf soccer pitch and to identify predictors for both the overall performance and sliding friendliness based on the players’ perceptions. Three types of artificial turf configurations were evaluated by an elite soccer team in five different trials. Statistical analyses were performed to check the reliability, the classification into factors and identification of predictors, respectively. The best predictors of the total judgement are the descriptors ‘hardness of the field during falling and during sprinting’ and ‘traction during stopping’ and the indicators ‘traction’ and ‘shock absorption’. For sliding friendliness solely, the best predictors are the descriptor ‘burning feeling of the skin after a sliding movement’ and the indicators ‘skin irritation’ and ‘traction’.","This paper develops and validates the Football Turf Performance Questionnaire to assess the performance of artificial turf in soccer, focusing on players' perceptions of both overall field performance and sliding friendliness.

Biomechanical Comparison of Single- and Double-Leg Jump Landings in the Sagittal and Frontal Plane,2016-06-01,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Jeffrey B. Taylor, Kevin R. Ford, Anh-Dung Nguyen, Sandra J. Shultz","Background: Double-leg forward or drop-jump landing activities are typically used to screen for high-risk movement strategies and to determine the success of neuromuscular injury prevention programs. However, research suggests that these tasks that occur primarily in the sagittal plane may not adequately represent the lower extremity biomechanics that occur during unilateral foot contact or non–sagittal plane movements that are characteristic of many multidirectional sports. Purpose: To examine the extent to which lower extremity biomechanics measured during a jump landing on a double leg (DL) after a sagittal plane (SAG) movement is representative of biomechanics measured during single-leg (SL) or frontal plane (FRONT) jump landing tasks. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Lower extremity biomechanics were measured in 15 recreationally active females (mean age [±SD], 19.4 ± 2.1 years; mean height, 163.3 ± 5.9 cm; mean weight, 61.1 ± 7.1 kg) while performing SAG DL , SAG SL , FRONT DL , and FRONT SL jump landing tasks. Repeated-measures analyses of variance examined differences in lower extremity biomechanics between the 4 tasks, and linear regressions examined the extent to which an individual’s biomechanics during SAG DL were representative of their biomechanics during SAG SL , FRONT DL , and FRONT SL . Results: Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics differed by condition, with the SAG DL task generally eliciting greater hip and knee flexion angles and lower hip and knee forces than the other tasks ( P &lt; .05). Although biomechanics during the SAG DL task were strongly associated with those during the FRONT DL task ( R 2 , 0.41-0.82), weaker associations were observed between SAG DL and single-leg tasks for hip kinematics ( R 2 , 0.03-0.25) and kinetics ( R 2 , 0.05-0.20) and knee abduction moments ( R 2 , 0.06-0.18) ( P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Standard double-leg sagittal plane jump landing tasks used to screen for ACL injury risk and the effectiveness of ACL injury prevention programs may not adequately represent the lower extremity biomechanics that occur during single-leg activities. Clinical Relevance: These results support further investigation of single-leg multidirectional landings to identify high-risk movement strategies in female athletes playing multidirectional sports.","This paper examines the differences in lower extremity biomechanics between single-leg and double-leg jump landings in both sagittal and frontal planes. The study finds that double-leg sagittal plane landing tasks may not accurately reflect the biomechanics of single-leg landings, highlighting the need for more focused assessments in multidirectional sports, particularly for ACL injury risk in female athletes."

Effects of a combined inversion and plantarflexion surface on knee and hip kinematics during landing,2016-05-31,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Kevin A. Valenzuela, Divya Bhaskaran, Cicily Hummer, Antonio Schefano, Songning Zhang","Although landing in a plantarflexion and inversion position is a well-known characteristic of lateral ankle sprains, the associated kinematics of the knee and hip is largely unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the changes in knee and hip kinematics during landings on an altered landing surface of combined plantarflexion and inversion. Participants performed five drop landings from 30 cm onto a trapdoor platform in three different conditions: flat landing surface, 25° inversion, or a combined 25° plantarflexion and 25° inversion. Kinematic data were collected using a seven camera motion capture system. A 2 × 3 (leg × surface) repeated measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. The combined surface showed decreased knee and hip flexion range of motion (ROM) and increased knee abduction ROM (p < 0.05). The altered landing surface creates a stiff landing pattern where reductions in sagittal plane motion are transferred to the frontal plane, resulting in increased knee abduction. A stiff landing pattern is frequently related to increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury. It may be beneficial for athletes at risk to train for alternate methods of increasing their sagittal plane motion of the knee and hip with active knee or trunk flexion.","This study investigates the effects of landing on a surface that induces combined inversion and plantarflexion on knee and hip kinematics, particularly in the context of lateral ankle sprains. The findings indicate that such surfaces lead to a reduction in knee and hip flexion range of motion and an increase in knee abduction, suggesting potential implications for injury risk and training strategies for athletes."

We analyzed 103 goals scored by Messi between over a decade in three competitions: La Liga (n = 74), Copa del Rey (n = 8), and the UEFA Champions League (n = 21). We used an ad-hoc observation instrument (OSMOS-soccer player) comprising 10 criteria and 50 categories; polar coordinate analysis, a powerful data reduction technique, revealed significant associations for body part and orientation, foot contact zone, turn direction, and locomotion. No significant associations were observed for pitch area or interaction with opponents. Our analysis confirms significant associations between different aspects of motor skill use by Messi immediately before scoring, namely use of lower limbs, foot contact zones, turn direction, use of wings, and orientation of body to move toward the goal. Studies of motor skills in soccer could shed light on the qualities that make certain players unique.","This paper investigates Lionel Messi's motor skills and laterality during individual goal-scoring actions in soccer, analyzing 103 goals across multiple competitions. Using polar coordinate analysis, the study identifies significant associations between Messi's use of lower limbs, foot contact zones, turn direction, and body orientation prior to scoring, highlighting the distinctive motor skills that contribute to his success."
EFFECTS OF FOOTWEAR VARIATIONS ON THREE-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS AND TIBIAL ACCELERATIONS OF SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS IN AMERICAN FOOTBALL,2016-05-25,World Scientific Pub Co Pte Lt,Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology,"J SINCLAIR, E ROONEY, R NAEMI, S ATKINS, N CHOCKALINGAM","American football is associated with a high rate of non-contact chronic injuries. Players are able to select from both high and low cut footwear. The aim of the current investigation was to examine the influence of high and low cut American football specific footwear on tibial accelerations and three-dimensional (3D) kinematics during three sport specific movements. Twelve male American football players performed three movements, run, cut and vertical jump whilst wearing both low and high cut footwear. 3D kinematics of the lower extremities were measured using an eight-camera motion analysis system alongside tibial acceleration parameters which were obtained using a shank mounted accelerometer. Tibial acceleration and 3D kinematic differences between the different footwear were examined using either repeated measures or Friedman’s ANOVA. Tibial accelerations were significantly greater in the low cut footwear in comparison to the high cut footwear for the run and cut movements. In addition, peak ankle eversion and tibial internal rotation parameters were shown to be significantly greater in the low cut footwear in the running and cutting movement conditions. The current study indicates that the utilization of low cut American football footwear for training/performance may place American footballers at increased risk from chronic injuries.","This paper investigates the impact of high and low cut footwear on tibial accelerations and three-dimensional kinematics during specific movements in American football. The findings reveal that low cut footwear results in higher tibial accelerations and increased peak ankle eversion and tibial internal rotation during running and cutting, suggesting a potential increased risk of chronic injuries for players using such footwear."

The Prevalence of Selected Intrinsic Risk Factors for Ankle Sprain Among Elite Football and Basketball Players,2016-05-23,Brieflands,Asian Journal of Sports Medicine,"Farzin Halabchi, Hooman Angoorani, Maryam Mirshahi, Mohammad Hosein Pourgharib Shahi, Mohammad Ali Mansournia","Lateral ankle sprains (LAS) are among the most common sports- related injuries and the reinjury rate is very high.This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of some intrinsic risk factors among professional football and basketball players with or without history of acute or recurrent ankle sprain.One hundred and six professional football and basketball players who were referred for pre-participation examinations were recruited in this study. Prepared checklist was completed for each participant. Athletes were asked for any history of previous ankle sprain and the severity (based of self-description of signs and symptoms by the athlete), level and number of injuries in the last two years. All players were assessed for measures of foot posture index- 6, foot length and width, Beighton generalized joint laxity score, anterior drawer and talar tilt tests, star excursion and single leg balance tests and goniometric assessment of ankle plantarflexion, ankle dorsiflexion and first metatarsophalangeal dorsiflexion.Forty eight basketball players (45.3%) and 58 football players (54.7%) with mean (SD) age of 19.8 (4.5) years participated. About 58.5% and 14.2% of athletes had a history of ankle sprain and recurrent sprain in at least one extremity, respectively. Sprains were more prevalent in basketball players and in dominant leg. There was no significant difference in assessed risk factors between athletes with and without history of ankle sprain, except for positive single leg balance test which was more prevalent in athletes with history of ankle sprain and also for positive talar tilt test and decreased ankle plantarflexion range of motion in acute and recurrent injury of left ankle.Some intrinsic risk factors including lateral ankle ligaments laxity, balance and ankle plantarflexion seem to be related to acute or recurrent LAS in athletes. Further research is needed to reveal the role of different arthrokinematics following lateral ankle sprain.","This paper evaluates the prevalence of intrinsic risk factors for lateral ankle sprains (LAS) in elite football and basketball players. Key findings include a high occurrence of ankle sprains, particularly in basketball players, and the identification of factors such as balance and ankle plantarflexion range of motion as potential contributors to acute or recurrent injuries."

This is surprising given soccer's global popularity. Epidemiological data suggest that female college soccer players are at a greater concussion injury risk than their male counterparts. Therefore, the purposes of our study were to quantify head impact frequency and magnitude during women's soccer practices and games in the National Collegiate Athletic Association and to characterize these data across event type, playing position, year on the team, and segment of game (first and second halves).Head impact biomechanics were collected from female college soccer players (n = 22; mean ± SD age = 19.1 ± 0.1 yr, height = 168.0 ± 3.5 cm, mass = 63.7 ± 6.0 kg). We employed a helmetless head impact measurement device (X2 Biosystems xPatch) before each competition and practice across a single season. Peak linear and rotational accelerations were categorized based on impact magnitude and subsequently analyzed using appropriate nonparametric analyses.Overall, women's college soccer players experience approximately seven impacts per 90 min of game play. The overwhelming majority (~90%) of all head impacts were categorized into our mildest linear acceleration impact classification (10g-20g). Interestingly, a higher percentage of practice impacts in the 20g-40g range compared with games (11% vs 7%) was observed.Head impact biomechanics studies have provided valuable insights into understanding collision sports and for informing evidence-based rule and policy changes. These have included changing the football kickoff, ice hockey body checking ages, and head-to-head hits in both sports. Given soccer's global popularity, and the growing public concern for the potential long-term neurological implications of collision and contact sports, studying soccer has the potential to impact many athletes and the sports medicine professionals caring for them.","This paper investigates head impact frequency and magnitude in women’s college soccer, highlighting the increased concussion risk among female players.

Traditional vs. sport-specific vertical jump tests: reliability, validity, and relationship with the legs strength and sprint performance in adult and teen soccer and basketball players. J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 196-206, 2017-The vertical jump is considered an essential motor skill in many team sports. Many protocols have been used to assess vertical jump ability. However, controversy regarding test selection still exists based on the reliability and specificity of the tests. The main aim of this study was to analyze the reliability and validity of 2 standardized (countermovement jump [CMJ] and Abalakov jump [AJ]) and 2 sport-specific (run-up with 2 [2-LEGS] or 1 leg [1-LEG] take-off jump) vertical jump tests, and their usefulness as predictors of sprint and strength performance for soccer (n = 127) and basketball (n = 59) players in 3 different categories (Under-15, Under-18, and Adults). Three attempts for each of the 4 jump tests were recorded. Twenty-meter sprint time and estimated 1 repetition maximum in full squat were also evaluated. All jump tests showed high intraclass correlation coefficients (0.969-0.995) and low coefficients of variation (1.54-4.82%), although 1-LEG was the jump test with the lowest absolute and relative reliability. All selected jump tests were significantly correlated (r = 0.580-0.983). Factor analysis resulted in the extraction of one principal component, which explained 82.90-95.79% of the variance of all jump tests. The 1-LEG test showed the lowest associations with sprint and strength performance. The results of this study suggest that CMJ and AJ are the most reliable tests for the estimation of explosive force in soccer and basketball players in different age categories.","This paper compares the reliability and validity of traditional and sport-specific vertical jump tests in assessing explosive force in soccer and basketball players across various age categories.

Specific biomechanical and neuromuscular variables have been used to estimate the risk of incurring a non-contact injury in athletes. Objective The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidences for the effectiveness of injury prevention protocols to modify biomechanical and neuromuscular anterior cruciate and/or hamstring injuries associated risk factors in uninjured team sport athletes. Data Sources PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Libraries, U.S. National Institutes of Health clinicaltrials.gov, Sport Discuss and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant journal articles published until March 2015. A manual review of relevant articles, authors, and journals, including bibliographies was performed from identified articles. Main Results Nineteen studies were included in this review. Four assessment categories: i) landing, ii) side cutting, iii) stop-jump, and iv) muscle strength outcomes, were used to analyze the effectiveness of the preventive protocols. Eight studies using multifaceted interventions supported by video and/or technical feedback showed improvement in landing and/or stop-jump biomechanics, while no effects were observed on side-cutting maneuver. Additionally, multifaceted programs including hamstring eccentric exercises increased hamstring strength, hamstring to quadriceps functional ratio and/or promoted a shift of optimal knee flexion peak torque toward a more open angle position. Conclusions Multifaceted programs, supported by proper video and/or technical feedback, including eccentric hamstring exercises would positively modify the biomechanical and or neuromuscular anterior cruciate and/or hamstring injury risk factors.","This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of injury prevention programs in modifying risk factors for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring injuries in uninjured team sports athletes.

This systematic review synthesises movement and muscle function findings to better understand deficits and guide rehabilitation. Prospective and retrospective cross-sectional studies investigating muscle strength, flexibility, cross-sectional area, electromyographic activation onset and magnitude in patients with SRGP were included. Four databases (MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, EBSCOhost and EMBASE) were searched in June 2014. Studies were critiqued using a modified version of the Downs and Black Quality Index, and a meta-analysis was performed. Seventeen studies (14 high quality, 3 low quality; 8 prospective and 9 retrospective) were identified. Prospective findings: moderate evidence indicated decreased hip abduction flexibility as a risk factor for SRGP. Limited or very limited evidence suggested that decreased hip adduction strength during isokinetic testing at ~119°/s was a risk factor for SRGP, but no associations were found at ~30°/s or ~210°/s, or with peak torque angle. Decreased hip abductor strength in angular velocity in ~30°/s but not in ~119°/s and ~210°/s was found as a risk factor for SRGP. No relationships were found with hip internal or external rotation range of movement, nor isokinetic knee extension strength. Decreased isokinetic knee flexion strength also was a potential risk factor for SRGP, at a speed ~60°/s. Retrospective findings: there was strong evidence of decreased hip adductor muscle strength during a squeeze test at 45°, and decreased total hip external rotation range of movement (sum of both legs) being associated with SRGP. There was strong evidence of no relationship to abductor muscle strength nor unilateral hip internal and external rotation range of movement. Moderate evidence suggested that increased abduction flexibility and no change in total hip internal rotation range of movement (sum of both legs) were retrospectively associated with SRGP. Limited or very limited evidence (significant findings only) indicated decreased hip adductor muscle strength during 0° and 30° squeeze tests and during an eccentric hip adduction test, but a decrease in the isometric adductors-to-abductors strength ratio at speed 120°/s; decreased abductors-to-adductors activation ratio in the early phase in the moving leg as well as in all three phases in the weight-bearing leg during standing hip flexion; and increased hip flexors strength during isokinetic and decrease in transversus abdominis muscle resting thickness associated with SRGP. There were a number of significant movement and muscle function associations observed in athletes both prior to and following the onset of SRGP. The strength of findings was hampered by the lack of consistent terminology and diagnostic criteria, with there being clear guides for future research. Nonetheless, these findings should be considered in rehabilitation and prevention planning.","This systematic review analyzes movement patterns and muscle function associated with sports-related groin pain (SRGP) in athletes, particularly in football, rugby, and hockey.

Fourteen experienced soccer players performed 45° cut test. They selected soccer boots with artificial ground design (AG), turf cleats boots (TF) and indoor boots (IN) randomly. A Vicon three dimension motion analysis system was used to capture kinematic data and Kistler force platform was used to record the ground reaction force. Novel Pedar-X insole plantar pressure measurement system was utilized to collect the plantar pressure synchronized. During 45° cut, artificial ground design (AG) showed significantly smaller peak knee flexion (p&lt;0.001) and greater abduction angles (p&lt;0.001) than indoor boots (IN). AG showed significantly greater vertical average loading rate (VALR) compared with TF (p=0.005) and IN (p=0.003). The results of plantar pressure found that AG showed the highest peak pressure and force-time integral in the heel (H) and medial forefoot (MFF).

Siegmund, Kevin R. Ford, Anh-Dung Nguyen, Jeffrey B. Taylor","Agility tests are a common component of athlete performance testing that incorporate straight line and lateral movement over short distances; however, the distribution of sagittal and frontal plane demands and the extent to which these tests accurately determine side-to-side asymmetries is currently unknown. PURPOSE: To obtain and report normative values for each component of the T-test and analyze its ability to reliably identify side-to-side asymmetries. METHODS: Fifty-five healthy, adolescent female soccer players (age: 15.6±1.3 years, height: 1.64±0.05 m, mass: 57.3±7.0 kg) completed four repetitions of the agility T-test on a standard laboratory floor. Wireless timing gates measured the time spent in each component of the agility T-test relative to the total duration which included: reaction to a visual starting cue (R), straight-line sprint (SP), initial short shuffle (SSh1), long shuffle (LSh), last short shuffle (SSh2), and backpedal (BP) phases. The direction of the SSh1 alternated between leading towards their dominant (kicking) and non-dominant (stance) limbs, with two trials performed in each direction. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to analyze the relative difference between the total time taken to complete each test and the relative time for each individual phase when leading toward the dominant and non-dominant limb. RESULTS: The following relative times were calculated for each phase: R=2.4%, SP=18.0%, SSh1=14.7%, LSh=25.4%, SSh2=14.9%, and BP=24.9%. No differences were shown in total time between trials leading with the dominant (14.62±0.8 s) or non-dominant (14.56±0.8 s, p=0.32) limb. The only significant differences between directions were identified during the SSh2 phase, where repetitions leading with the dominant limb (14.8±0.6%) were faster than the non-dominant (15.1±0.5%) limb (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: The agility T-test promotes relatively large distributions of both sagittal and frontal plane movements. If attempting to identify side-to-side differences, timing of the SSh2 may best differentiate lateral movement efficiency and is dependent on the direction of movement.","This paper investigates the normative values and side-to-side asymmetries in the Agility T-test among high school female soccer players.

DeLang, Paige Medley, Danielle Arsenault, Zachary Colesa, Tamara Hew-Butler","Comparing two prevalent types of soccer kicks, instep kick (dorsum of foot, at laces) and pass kick (medial foot, at longitudinal arch), can highlight functionality and effectiveness during play. PURPOSE: Identify biomechanical differences between instep kick and pass kick during soccer play, comparing dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) kicking foot. METHODS: 17 male NCAA D1 collegiate soccer players (age 19.6±1.5years; BMI 23.9±1.4kg/m2) performed 3 instep and 3 pass kicks with each foot aimed at a 1.2x1.2m target with center 9m away, raised 0.3m from ground. Maximal kick of each type was used. Self-reported footedness determined D and ND. Ball velocity was captured via motion analysis (Simi Aktisys 2D) and accuracy quantified in two measures: distance from center target and angle of deviation from target. RESULTS: Instep kicks (D and ND combined) demonstrated higher velocity than pass kicks (25.6±2.8 m/s; 23.4±2.3 m/s; p<0.001). D foot kicks had greater instep velocity (27.0±2.1 m/s) than pass kick velocity (24.2±2.2 m/s; p<0.001), but ND footed kicks did not demonstrate significance (24.1±2.7 m/s; 22.6±2.2 m/s; p=0.09). Accuracy by angle of deviation demonstrated pass kicks (D and ND combined) were more accurate than instep kicks (4.1±2.0°; 6.2±3.7°; p<0.005), with significance in accuracy also noted in ND kicks (4.3±2.2°; 6.8±4.0°; p<0.05). D foot kicks were nearly significant (3.9±1.8°; 5.6±3.4°; p=0.07). Accuracy by distance from center (D and ND combined) showed pass kicks (0.9±0.5 m) were significantly more accurate than instep kicks (1.16±0.7 m; p<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Instep kicks function for shooting; pass kicks for precision. Instep kicks have greater velocity than pass kicks, but not in ND limb, which may be harder to develop and thus disparities are not achieved. Pass kicks have greater overall accuracy than instep kicks, but not necessarily dependent on D or ND: more even distribution of pass kicks between D and ND may be exhibited due to their high prevalence of use during play. D versus ND limb capabilities should be further examined.","This paper investigates the biomechanical differences between instep and pass kicks in collegiate male soccer players, focusing on velocity and accuracy parameters.

Hip Abductor Strength Predicts Lateral Non-contact Ankle Sprains in Male Soccer Players,2016-05-01,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Rachel K. Straub, Khaili Khayambashi, Navid Ghoddosi, Christopher M. Powers","PURPOSE: Deficits in hip abductor strength have been linked to increased risk of lower-extremity injury. We aimed to prospectively determine whether preseason hip abductor strength predicts future lateral non-contact ankle sprains in competitive athletes. METHODS: Prior to the start of the sports season, isometric hip abductor strength was assessed bilaterally in competitive soccer players (210 males) using a hand-held dynamometer. During the sport seasons, lateral ankle sprain status was recorded, and injured athletes were further classified based on the mechanism of injury (non-contact vs. contact). Postseason, a logistic model was constructed to determine whether baseline hip abductor strength predicted future lateral non-contact ankle sprains. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for hip abductor strength to determine the clinical cut-off value that distinguished between a high-risk and low-risk outcome. RESULTS: A total of 25 lateral non-contact ankle sprains were confirmed for an overall annual incidence of 11.9%. Baseline hip abductor strength was significantly lower in injured athletes compared to non-injured athletes (35.7 ± 5.6 vs. 39.5 ± 6.6 %BW, p = 0.008). Logistic regression indicated impaired hip abductor strength increased future injury risk [OR = 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.18), p = 0.010]. The clinical cutoff to define high risk was established as hip abductor strength ≤ 33.8 %BW. Using this cutoff, athletes classified as high risk have their probability of injury increase from 11.9% to 26.7%; whereas; athletes classified as low risk have their probability of injury decrease from 11.9% to 8.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired isometric hip abductor strength predisposes competitive male soccer players to lateral non-contact ankle sprains. Screening procedures should consider evaluating isometric hip abductor strength (specifically for high-level male athletes participating in soccer) as preseason hip abductor predicts future lateral non-contact ankle sprains.","The paper investigates the relationship between hip abductor strength and the incidence of lateral non-contact ankle sprains in male soccer players.

These two aspects can contribute to enhance neuromuscular control of de lower limbs. PURPOSE: To determine the effect of FIFA 11+ on the neuromuscular control related to the lower limbs muscle power in professional soccer players (Colombia’s 2nd division). METHODS: Twenty subjects belonging to the same team participated in this study: ten were allocated to the FIFA 11+ group (age 18,6+1,17 years; weight 65,9 + 8,50 kg; height 1,76+0,06 m; body index mass 21,16+1,86) and the remaining ten to the control group (age 19,4+0,97 years; weight 68,1+5,65 kg; height 1,75+0,07; body index mass 22,04+1,12). FIFA 11+ training was performed three times per week during two months; every session had a duration of twenty minutes (additional to the normal routine).Control group training was the same than the players were used to (just the normal routine). Vertical jumps used to evaluate the effect of FIFA 11+ in the muscle power were countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ) and Abalakov jump (ABK). BTS P-6000 force plattform was used for the experiment (Area = 60cm x 40cm; fsample = 1kHz). Ground reaction force (GRF) was measured and the following variables were calculated for both the dominant and non-dominant limbs: a) maximum landing force, b) maximum impulse force, c) flight time and d) time to stabilization after landing. Three trials were carried out for every jump (CMJ, SJ and ABK) and parametric statistics (Mann Whitney test) were used to analyze the registered data. RESULTS: Obtained results indicate a statistically significant reduction of the non-dominant limb maximum landing force for SJ (FIFA 11+ group 2579,69+902,19 N; control group 2976,45+995,44 N; p=0,04) and CMJ (FIFA 11+ group 2422,51+1159,21 N); control group 3034,57+1273,49 N; p=0,05) in the FIFA 11+ group. CONCLUSION: Two months of FIFA 11+ training contributes to the minimization of the injury risk related to impacts suffered by the non-dominant lower limb. These results show the great potential of FIFA 11+ program as a protection tool for the most common lower limbs injuries that affect soccer players.","This paper investigates the impact of the FIFA 11+ training program on neuromuscular control and muscle power of the lower limbs in professional soccer players. The findings demonstrate that participation in the FIFA 11+ program significantly reduces maximum landing force in the non-dominant limb, suggesting its effectiveness in minimizing injury risks associated with lower limb impacts."
Accelerated rehabilitation after arthroscopic Bankart repair in professional footballers,2016-04-30,SAGE Publications,Shoulder &amp; Elbow,"Jo Gibson, Jim Kerss, Chris Morgan, Peter Brownson","Advances in arthroscopic surgery have resulted in biomechanically stronger repairs that might allow for accelerated rehabilitation protocols and hence faster return to play. Evidence for such regimes in the shoulder, particularly in elite athletes, is lacking.This prospective single surgeon (PB) series included 34 professional footballers undergoing an accelerated rehabilitation programme following arthroscopic soft tissue stabilization subsequent to traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Data were collected on time to regain elevation range, external rotation range, return to play and rate of recurrence.Mean follow-up time was 4.8 years (range 2 years to 10 years). Full range of forward elevation was regained at a mean of 5 weeks (range 3 weeks to 7 weeks) and external rotation range (in neutral) at a mean of 6 weeks (range 4 weeks to 8 weeks). Mean return to play time was 11 weeks (range 9 weeks to 14 weeks). Three players (9%) reported a recurrent episode of dislocation at a mean of 19 months.An accelerated rehabilitation programme resulted in a return to play time of 11 weeks compared to previously reported times of between 5 months and 9 months in the contact sports population. A recurrence rate of 9% compares favourably to other published studies following similar surgery (5.1% to 28.6%) but which employed more conservative postoperative rehabilitation regimes.","This paper investigates the impacts of an accelerated rehabilitation program on professional footballers following arthroscopic Bankart repair for shoulder dislocation. The findings indicate a significant reduction in return to play time to an average of 11 weeks, alongside a relatively low recurrence rate of 9%, suggesting that advanced surgical techniques may facilitate quicker recovery in elite athletes."
Coach decision-making and the relative age effect on talent selection in football,2016-04-24,Informa UK Limited,European Sport Management Quarterly,"Brad Hill, Popi Sotiriadou","Research Question(s): Talent selection is a stepping stone to sporting success at national and international levels. The research questions that guided this study were: (a) What is the decision-making (DM) process that coaches (as key selectors) use during talent selection? and (b) In what ways does awareness of the relative age effect (RAE) influence their DM?Research Methods: This study employed an action research approach in order to raise coach awareness of RAE on talent selection to examine the decisions surrounding selection of players. From a sample of 263 male football (soccer) players (age range 12–15) and 4 coaches, qualitative and quantitative data were collected on coach decisions for selection of players and frequencies of selected players in birth-months. Secondary data were also gathered from previous year's selections.Results and Findings: Logistic regression showed that coaches' awareness of RAE did not eliminate nor reduce it. In-depth interviews revealed that coaches' DM was influenced by preconceptions and various pressures to select certain players. Pressures resonated within the volatile nature of their profession and career goals, the existence of competing decision-makers such as peers and parents, and the tension to select players for immediate success.Implications: The results lead to the consideration of various practical recommendations on coach organisation, coach education and alternative interventions in DM such as an alternative staged approach to talent selection that lends itself open for future research.","This paper examines the decision-making processes of coaches in talent selection within football, particularly focusing on the influence of the relative age effect (RAE). The findings indicate that while coaches may be aware of RAE, it does not significantly affect their selection decisions, which are instead shaped by personal biases and external pressures related to immediate success."
Sex and growth effect on pediatric hip injuries presenting to sports medicine clinic,2016-04-22,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics B,"Andrea Stracciolini, Yi-Meng Yen, Pierre A. d’Hemecourt, Cara L. Lewis, Dai Sugimoto","To compare sports-related hip injuries on the basis of sex and age in a cohort of young athletes. A 5% random probability sample of all new patients' charts over a 10-year time period was selected for investigation. The most common hip injury diagnoses, sport at time of injury, mechanism (acute/traumatic vs. overuse), and types (bony vs. soft tissue) were compared by sex and age (preadolescent vs. adolescent). Descriptive and χ-analyses were carried out. The interaction of sex and age with respect to hip injury over time was examined by two-way (sex, age) analysis of variance. A total of 2133 charts were reviewed; N=87 hip injuries. The main diagnoses for males included labral tear (23.1%), avulsion fracture (11.5%), slipped capital femoral epiphysis (11.5%), dislocation (7.7%), and tendonitis (7.7%). The main diagnoses for females were labral tear (59.0%), tendonitis (14.8%), snapping hip syndrome (6.6%), strain (4.9%), and bursitis (4.9%). The five most common sports/activities at the time of hip injury were dancing/ballet (23.0%), soccer (18.4%), gymnastics (9.2%), ice hockey (8.1%), and track and field (6.9%). Age by sex comparisons showed a greater proportion of the total hip injuries (38.5%) in males compared with females (8.2%) during preadolescence (5-12 years). However, in adolescence (13-17 years), the hip injury proportion was significantly higher in females (91.8%) compared with males (61.5%; P<0.001). Injury mechanism and type differed by sex, with females sustaining more chronic/overuse (95.1%) and soft tissue type injuries (93.4%) compared with males (50.0 and 53.8%, respectively; P<0.001). Females were found to have a sharper increase in hip injury proportion as they progressed through puberty compared with males (analysis of variance sex-by-age interaction; P<0.001). Hip injury mechanism and type differed significantly between males and females during growth. Notably, the proportion of hip injuries in the young female athletes showed a significantly greater increase with advancing age compared with males. Hip injuries in children and the interplay with growth, as it relates to injury predisposition, require further investigation to facilitate efforts aimed at prevention.","The paper investigates sports-related hip injuries in young athletes, focusing on the differences based on sex and age. Key findings include a higher incidence of hip injuries in males during preadolescence, while females experience a significant increase during adolescence, particularly with overuse and soft tissue injuries, highlighting the need for further research to inform prevention strategies."

Twenty-four male soccer players performed 2 different protocols: (a) regular soccer training with 5 sessions per week (n = 11; age = 12.7 ± 0.3 years) and (b) regular soccer training with 3 sessions per week and HVRT with 2 sessions per week (n = 13; age = 12.8 ± 0.2 years). The outcome measures included tests for the assessment of muscle strength (e.g., 1 repetition maximum [1RM] half-squat tests), jump ability (e.g., countermovement jump, squat jump [SJ], standing long jump [SLJ], and multiple 5-bound tests [MB5s]), linear speed (e.g., 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-m sprint tests), and change of direction (e.g., T-test and Illinois change of direction test). Results revealed significant group × test interactions for the SJ test (p ≤ 0.05, d = 0.59) and the SLJ test (p < 0.01, d = 0.83).

Analysis of positional training loads (ratings of perceived exertion) during various-sided games in European professional soccer players,2016-04-18,SAGE Publications,International Journal of Sports Science &amp; Coaching,"Adam L Owen, Gordon Dunlop, Mehdi Rouissi, Monoem Haddad, Bruno Mendes, Karim Chamari","The primary aim of the study was to perform a comparative analysis of the positional training loads during various game formats among European professional soccer players. Twenty-two male professional soccer players participated in the investigation and were divided into their tactical positional roles for analysis. Ratings of perceived exertion were collected daily and corresponded to specific formatted game types (small-sided games; large-sided games; large-sided games within a smaller area size) implemented as part of the weekly periodised training structure. Across the sample period, only one game per week training scenarios were analysed (9 × small-sided games; 9 × large-sided games; 9 × large-sided games within a smaller area size). Analysis of the mean ratings of perceived exertion between various game formats revealed significant differences between large-sided games within a smaller area size vs. small-sided games (5.53 vs. 7.79; p = 0.007); however, no differences were presented between small-sided games vs. large-sided games format types (7.9 vs. 7.35; p &gt; 0.05). No differences between mean ratings of perceived exertion and small-sided games and large-sided games, respectively, were found. Differences were shown between positional demands during large-sided games within a smaller area size game type formats, with wide forwards reporting higher mean ratings of perceived exertion values when compared against centre forwards ( p = 0.02). Therefore, within a periodised microcycle, variance of game formats can be used to manipulate training loads, manage accumulation of fatigue through a tapering method in order to facilitate optimal match preparation. Furthermore, players of certain position types may require additional training stimulus to induce the desired physical adaptations.","The paper conducts a comparative analysis of positional training loads, measured through ratings of perceived exertion, among European professional soccer players during various-sided game formats. It identifies significant differences in exertion levels based on game size and player positions, suggesting that varying training formats can help manage fatigue and enhance match preparation."
The Association Between Serum Biomarkers of Collagen Turnover and Subsequent Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture,2016-04-15,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Steven J. Svoboda, Brett D. Owens, Travis M. Harvey, Patrick M. Tarwater, William F. Brechue, Kenneth L. Cameron","Background: No study has attempted to associate the levels of preinjury serum biomarkers of collagen turnover with the subsequent risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Hypothesis: Preinjury serum biomarkers of collagen turnover would be associated with the subsequent risk of ACL injury. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We conducted a case-control study with 45 ACL-injured cases and 45 controls matched for sex, age, height, and weight. In addition to the matching criteria, controls had no history of major joint injury. Baseline preinjury serum samples were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository for all subjects. Samples were assessed for 2 serum biomarkers of collagen synthesis (CPII and CS846) and 2 markers of collagen degradation (C1,2C and C2C) through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. All ELISAs were performed in triplicate. Conditional logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Results: Univariate results suggested that both biomarkers for collagen degradation (C1,2C and C2C) were significantly associated with the subsequent likelihood of ACL injury. Serum C2C and C1,2C concentration at baseline were associated with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.05 (95% CI, 1.30-3.23; P = .001) and 3.02 (95% CI, 1.60-5.71; P = .002), respectively. Baseline serum CPII concentrations were also associated with subsequent ACL injury. Serum CPII concentration at baseline was associated with an OR of 4.41 (95% CI, 1.87-10.38; P = .001). Baseline serum CS846 levels approached significance (OR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.03; P = .080). Multivariable models suggested that preinjury CPII and C2C concentrations at baseline are important indicators of subsequent ACL injury risk. Conclusion: Preinjury differences in serum biomarker levels of collagen turnover suggest that collagen metabolism in individuals who go on to tear an ACL may be different when compared with a matched control group with no history of major joint injury. These differences may be reflective of different preinjury biochemical and/or biomechanical risk profiles or genetic factors that subsequently affect both collagen metabolism and ACL injury risk.","This paper investigates the relationship between preinjury serum biomarkers of collagen turnover and the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, utilizing a case-control study design. The findings indicate that higher levels of collagen degradation biomarkers are significantly associated with increased odds of ACL injury, suggesting a potential link between collagen metabolism and injury risk."
Strain Response of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament to Uniplanar and Multiplanar Loads During Simulated Landings,2016-04-14,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Ata M. Kiapour, Constantine K. Demetropoulos, Ali Kiapour, Carmen E. Quatman, Samuel C. Wordeman, Vijay K. Goel, Timothy E. Hewett","Background: Despite basic characterization of the loading factors that strain the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the interrelationship(s) and additive nature of these loads that occur during noncontact ACL injuries remain incompletely characterized. Hypothesis: In the presence of an impulsive axial compression, simulating vertical ground-reaction force during landing (1) both knee abduction and internal tibial rotation moments would result in increased peak ACL strain, and (2) a combined multiplanar loading condition, including both knee abduction and internal tibial rotation moments, would increase the peak ACL strain to levels greater than those under uniplanar loading modes alone. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A cadaveric model of landing was used to simulate dynamic landings during a jump in 17 cadaveric lower extremities (age, 45 ± 7 years; 9 female and 8 male). Peak ACL strain was measured in situ and characterized under impulsive axial compression and simulated muscle forces (baseline) followed by addition of anterior tibial shear, knee abduction, and internal tibial rotation loads in both uni- and multiplanar modes, simulating a broad range of landing conditions. The associations between knee rotational kinematics and peak ACL strain levels were further investigated to determine the potential noncontact injury mechanism. Results: Externally applied loads, under both uni- and multiplanar conditions, resulted in consistent increases in peak ACL strain compared with the baseline during simulated landings (by up to 3.5-fold; P ≤ .032). Combined multiplanar loading resulted in the greatest increases in peak ACL strain ( P &lt; .001). Degrees of knee abduction rotation ( R 2 = 0.45; β = 0.42) and internal tibial rotation ( R 2 = 0.32; β = 0.23) were both significantly correlated with peak ACL strain ( P &lt; .001). However, changes in knee abduction rotation had a significantly greater effect size on peak ACL strain levels than did internal tibial rotation (by ~2-fold; P &lt; .001). Conclusion: In the presence of impulsive axial compression, the combination of anterior tibial shear force, knee abduction, and internal tibial rotation moments significantly increases ACL strain, which could result in ACL failure. These findings support multiplanar knee valgus collapse as one the primary mechanisms of noncontact ACL injuries during landing. Clinical Relevance: Intervention programs that address multiple planes of loading may decrease the risk of ACL injury and the devastating consequences of posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis.","This paper investigates the strain response of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) under uniplanar and multiplanar loads during simulated landings to understand injury mechanisms. The study finds that combined multiplanar loading, particularly knee abduction and internal tibial rotation, significantly increases peak ACL strain, suggesting that such loading conditions contribute to noncontact ACL injuries and emphasizing the need for intervention programs targeting these factors."

Material and methods The study sample comprised 9 female soccer players and 19 non-training girls. They underwent three measurement sessions, one every six months. The applied tests included kinesthetic differentiation, rate of local movements, static balance, single-leg hop, rate of global movements, strength and speed, and functional asymmetry of the legs tests. Results The soccer players were better than the controls in their performance of the rate of local movements, rate of global movements, kinesthetic differentiation, single-leg 15m timed hop and static balance tests. Smaller differences between the results of the left and the right legs in soccer players, than in non-training girls, were noted in the rate of local movements, rate of global movements and kinesthetic differentiation tests. In the static balance test, the differences were greater in the group of soccer players. Conclusions Lateralization of the lower limbs is a highly complex characteristic with a different variability in athletes than in nontraining individuals. The results of the present study also point to the specialization of soccer players’ left legs in body balance and single-leg hop tests.","The paper investigates the laterality of the legs in young female soccer players compared to non-training counterparts, focusing on various physical performance metrics over three measurement sessions.

"Effects of Prophylactic Knee Bracing on Lower Limb Kinematics, Kinetics, and Energetics During Double-Leg Drop Landing at 2 Heights",2016-04-13,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Katie A. Ewing, Rezaul K. Begg, Mary P. Galea, Peter V.S. Lee","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries commonly occur during landing maneuvers. Prophylactic knee braces were introduced to reduce the risk of ACL injuries, but their effectiveness is debated. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that bracing would improve biomechanical factors previously related to the risk of ACL injuries, such as increased hip and knee flexion angles at initial contact and at peak vertical ground-reaction force (GRF), increased ankle plantar flexion angles at initial contact, decreased peak GRFs, and decreased peak knee extension moment. We also hypothesized that bracing would increase the negative power and work of the hip joint and would decrease the negative power and work of the knee and ankle joints. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional motion and force plate data were collected from 8 female and 7 male recreational athletes performing double-leg drop landings from 0.30 m and 0.60 m with and without a prophylactic knee brace. GRFs, joint angles, moments, power, and work were calculated for each athlete with and without a knee brace. Results: Prophylactic knee bracing increased the hip flexion angle at peak GRF by 5.56° ( P &lt; .001), knee flexion angle at peak GRF by 4.75° ( P = .001), and peak hip extension moment by 0.44 N·m/kg ( P &lt; .001). Bracing also increased the peak hip negative power by 4.89 W/kg ( P = .002) and hip negative work by 0.14 J/kg ( P = .001) but did not result in significant differences in the energetics of the knee and ankle. No differences in peak GRFs and peak knee extension moment were observed with bracing. Conclusion: The application of a prophylactic knee brace resulted in improvements in important biomechanical factors associated with the risk of ACL injuries. Clinical Relevance: Prophylactic knee braces may help reduce the risk of noncontact knee injuries in recreational and professional athletes while playing sports. Further studies should investigate different types of prophylactic knee braces in conjunction with existing training interventions so that the sports medicine community can better assess the effectiveness of prophylactic knee bracing.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of prophylactic knee bracing on lower limb kinematics and kinetics during double-leg drop landings to assess its potential in reducing the risk of ACL injuries. Results indicate that bracing significantly improved hip and knee flexion angles at peak ground-reaction force and increased hip negative power and work, while showing no notable effects on knee and ankle energetics."
Biomechanical modeling as a practical tool for predicting injury risk related to repetitive muscle lengthening during learning and training of human complex motor skills,2016-04-12,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,SpringerPlus,"Bingjun Wan, Gongbing Shan","Previous studies have shown that muscle repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) are often related to sport trainings among young participants. As such, understanding the mechanism of RSIs is essential for injury prevention. One potential means would be to identify muscles in risk by applying biomechanical modeling. By capturing 3D movements of four typical youth sports and building the biomechanical models, the current study has identified several risk factors related to the development of RSIs. The causal factors for RSIs are the muscle over-lengthening, the impact-like (speedy increase) eccentric tension in muscles, imbalance between agonists and antagonists, muscle loading frequency and muscle strength. In general, a large range of motion of joints would lead to over-lengthening of certain small muscles; Limb's acceleration during power generation could cause imbalance between agonists and antagonists; a quick deceleration of limbs during follow-throughs would induce an impact-like eccentric tension to muscles; and even at low speed, frequent muscle over-lengthening would cause a micro-trauma accumulation which could result in RSIs in long term. Based on the results, the following measures can be applied to reduce the risk of RSIs during learning/training in youth participants: (1) stretching training of muscles at risk in order to increase lengthening ability; (2) dynamic warming-up for minimizing possible imbalance between agonists and antagonists; (3) limiting practice times of the frequency and duration of movements requiring strength and/or large range of motion to reducing micro-trauma accumulation; and (4) allowing enough repair time for recovery from micro-traumas induced by training (individual training time). Collectively, the results show that biomechanical modeling is a practical tool for predicting injury risk and provides an effective way to establish an optimization strategy to counteract the factors leading to muscle repetitive stress injuries during motor skill learning and training.","The paper focuses on using biomechanical modeling to predict and prevent repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) in young athletes during training of complex motor skills. Key findings highlight risk factors such as muscle over-lengthening, eccentric tension, and muscle imbalances, and suggest preventive measures, including targeted stretching and dynamic warm-ups to mitigate these injuries."
Physiological demands of soccer: implications for training youth,2016-04-07,editor,"Youth sports: participation, trainability and readiness",Thomas Reilly,"A fundamental tenet of ergonomics is a focus on the human, whether male or female, young, adult or ageing.In the design of any activity, the tasks must be suited to the capability of the human.Such capabilities are limited, whether expressed in physical, physiological, psychological or perceptual motor terms.This notion of limited capacity is especially appropriate when youth soccer is concerned.The principle is that if the demands -of training or competitive match-play -exceed the individual's capacities, the result is excessive strain on that young person.Sport does not necessarily comply with ergonomics principles since competition is associated with pushing back limits.Sports training theory relies on the principle of overload.The reasoning is that by imposing an overload on the organism, it gradually adapts to the training stress to reach a new level of performance capability.The athlete goes through a sequence of stages incorporating overload, recovery and adaptation in an upwardly spiralling cycle of improvement.Once the individual adapts to a new level of training stress, performance may attain a plateau so that the training stimulus must again be upgraded to induce further improvements.This model of progressive overload becomes abstract when the individual fails to respond to training in the predicted way.Indeed performance may actually deteriorate even though the training stimulus is maintained.This phenomenon is known as 'overtraining' and sometimes referred to as 'overreaching'.Repeated scientific attempts to identify biological predictors of this state have proved inconclusive.In the context of the young soccer player, an 'overtrained' state would be highly undesirable.Negative consequences include absence from participation whilst reaching recovery, associated 'burnout' and a disaffection with playing the game.","This paper discusses the physiological demands placed on youth soccer players and emphasizes the importance of aligning training with the individual capabilities of young athletes to prevent excessive strain. It highlights the potential for overtraining and its negative consequences, such as burnout and reduced participation, underlining the need for careful consideration in training practices for youth in sports."

Stitzel, Joseph A. Maldjian","The purpose of this study was to determine whether the effects of cumulative head impacts during a season of high school football produce changes in diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussion. Subjects were recruited from a high school football team and were outfitted with the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) during all practices and games. Biomechanical head impact exposure metrics were calculated, including: total impacts, summed acceleration, and Risk Weighted Cumulative Exposure (RWE). Twenty-four players completed pre- and post-season magnetic resonance imaging, including DKI; players who experienced clinical concussion were excluded. Fourteen subjects completed pre- and post-season Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). DKI-derived metrics included mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (K axial), and radial kurtosis (K radial), and white matter modeling (WMM) parameters included axonal water fraction, tortuosity of the extra-axonal space, extra-axonal diffusivity (De axial and radial), and intra-axonal diffusivity (Da). These metrics were used to determine the total number of abnormal voxels, defined as 2 standard deviations above or below the group mean. Linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between RWE combined probability (RWECP) and MK. Secondary analysis of other DKI-derived and WMM metrics demonstrated statistically significant linear relationships with RWECP after covariate adjustment. These results were compared with the results of DTI-derived metrics from the same imaging sessions in this exact same cohort. Several of the DKI-derived scalars (Da, MK, K axial, and K radial) explained more variance, compared with RWECP, suggesting that DKI may be more sensitive to subconcussive head impacts. No significant relationships between DKI-derived metrics and ImPACT measures were found. It is important to note that the pathological implications of these metrics are not well understood. In summary, we demonstrate a single season of high school football can produce DKI measurable changes in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussion.","This study investigates the impact of cumulative head impacts on diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics among high school football players throughout a season, excluding those with clinically diagnosed concussion.

Sport-specific functional movement can simulate aspects of neuromuscular fatigue occurring in team sports,2016-04-02,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Jan Wilke, Johannes Fleckenstein, Frieder Krause, Lutz Vogt, Winfried Banzer","Fatigue protocols have been used over the years to examine muscular exhaustion. As an alternative to approaches in laboratory settings, functional agility protocols claiming to mimic the multifaceted loads of athletic activity have been proposed. This study aimed to examine the effects of a functional agility short-term fatigue protocol (FAST-FP) on neuromuscular function. Twenty-eight healthy sports students (15 males, aged 24.3 ± 2.4 years) completed the FAST-FP, which consists of four components: three counter-movement jumps (90% of individual maximum), a 20-s bout of step-ups, three bodyweight squats and an agility run. Tasks were repeated until the participants no longer achieved the required jump height in two consecutive sets. Outcomes (pre-post) encompassed subjective exhaustion (visual analogue scale [VAS]), maximum isometric voluntary force of the knee extensors (MIVF), reactive strength index (RSI), mean power frequency (MPF, measured using surface electromyography) and maximum knee range of motion (ROM). Post-intervention, VAS (+54 mm) increased significantly, while MIVF (-6.1%), RSI (-10.7%) and MPF (-4.1%) were reduced (p < 0.05). No changes were observed for ROM (p > 0.05). The FAST-FP induces small-to-moderate impairments in neuromuscular function and considerable self-perceived fatigue. Current evidence on exhaustion developing in team sports suggests that this magnitude of fatigue is similar. The protocol might thus be valuable in the evaluation of treatments counteracting post-match fatigue in team sports.","This study investigates a functional agility short-term fatigue protocol (FAST-FP) designed to simulate neuromuscular fatigue typical in team sports.

We aimed at identifying movement strategies which enhance the players' half-turning performance, by characterising technique kinematics and understanding the structure of biomechanical and anthropometrics variables. Ten Under-13 sub-elite male players were recorded with an optoelectronic motion analyser while performing a 5-m straight dribbling followed by a half-turn with the sole. Joints kinematics differences between faster and slower trials were found in support-side hip rotation, driving-side hip adduction, trunk flexion and rotation, and arms abduction. To unveil the data-set structure, a principal component (PC) analysis and a stepwise linear discriminant analysis were performed using 30 biomechanical parameters and four anthropometric variables for each trial. Seven retained PCs explained 79% of the overall variability, featuring combinations of original variables that help in understanding the factors facilitating fast half-turns: keeping short steps, minimising lateral and forward body movements, and centre-of-mass lowering, even with ample lower limbs ranges of motion (RoM); abducting the upper limbs while limiting trunk flexion and pelvic inclination RoM. Balance and task-constrained exercises may be proposed to improve this technique. Moreover, a quantitative knowledge of the movement structure could give coaches objective insights to better instruct young players.","This paper investigates the biomechanics of the half-turn movement in sub-elite youth soccer players, focusing on the kinematic strategies that enhance performance during this maneuver. Key findings include the identification of specific joint kinematics that differentiate faster from slower executions, along with suggestions for training improvements based on a detailed analysis of biomechanical and anthropometric factors."
Balance Maintenance in the Upright Body Position: Analysis of Autocorrelation,2016-04-01,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Jacek Stodolka¹, Marian Golema², Juliusz Migasiewicz","Abstract The present research aimed to analyze values of the autocorrelation function measured for different time values of ground reaction forces during stable upright standing. It was hypothesized that if recording of force in time depended on the quality and way of regulating force by the central nervous system (as a regulator), then the application of autocorrelation for time series in the analysis of force changes in time function would allow to determine regulator properties and its functioning. The study was performed on 82 subjects (students, athletes, senior and junior soccer players and subjects who suffered from lower limb injuries). The research was conducted with the use of two Kistler force plates and was based on measurements of ground reaction forces taken during a 15 s period of standing upright while relaxed. The results of the autocorrelation function were statistically analyzed. The research revealed a significant correlation between a derivative extreme and velocity of reaching the extreme by the autocorrelation function, described as gradient strength. Low correlation values (all statistically significant) were observed between time of the autocorrelation curve passing through 0 axis and time of reaching the first peak by the said function. Parameters computed on the basis of the autocorrelation function are a reliable means to evaluate the process of flow of stimuli in the nervous system. Significant correlations observed between the parameters of the autocorrelation function indicate that individual parameters provide similar properties of the central nervous system.","The paper investigates the autocorrelation function of ground reaction forces during stable upright standing among various subjects, including athletes and individuals with lower limb injuries. It highlights the relationship between the central nervous system's regulatory properties and the patterns of force changes over time, suggesting that autocorrelation analysis can serve as a reliable method for assessing neural stimulus processing."
"The influence of natural grass surface hardness on path changes, locomotive movements and game events in soccer: a case study",2016-04-01,Informa UK Limited,International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport,"Wes Sleat, Peter O’Donoghue, Mike Hughes, N. Ian Bezodis","Sporting performance and outcomes are affected by surface type and hardness. Natural grass surface characteristics can vary considerably at amateur level sport which can influence technical skills and locomotive movements. Surface hardness and human responses need to be objectively measured in order to fully understand movement responses and subsequent performance. In the present study, one academy u-19 soccer player played in eleven competitive matches. Surface hardness was measured using a Clegg Impact Hammer and pitches were categorised into either harder or softer groups (67.7 to 93.0 Gmax and 41.4 to 58.3 Gmax respectively). The frequency of high intensity shuffling was significantly greater on softer grass (11.2±2.1) when compared to harder grass (6.1±3.8) (p < 0.05). A large effect size was revealed with running, dribbling, low and high intensity activities as greater frequencies were evident on softer grass when compared to harder grass. There were no significant differences for any of the game events, but there was a large effect size for aerial challenges and headed clearances which were performed more often on softer surfaces than on harder surfaces. There was a greater frequency of moderate intensity, sharp path changes to the right and v-cut path change performed on softer surfaces than on harder surfaces and the effect sizes were large. To conclude, movement activity and game events performed were influenced by natural grass surface hardness. Future research should endeavour to explore differences in the physical work-rate in terms of the biomechanical and physiological demands.","This paper examines how the hardness of natural grass surfaces impacts player movements and game events in soccer. The findings indicate that softer grass facilitates higher intensities of shuffling and certain movement patterns, while suggesting that future research should investigate the underlying biomechanical and physiological demands associated with these interactions."

Cognitive Function as Related to Cumulative Head Impact Exposure in Football: Effects of Position,2016-04-01,Wiley,The FASEB Journal,"Danielle Brewer Deluce, Timothy D Wilson, Adrian M Owen","Repetitive sub‐clinical head impacts are linked to progressive cognitive decline and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) diagnoses in professional contact‐sport athletes post mortem. There exists a gap however in understanding when this long‐term damage occurs, and specifically in determining the career stage when signs of injury can be first detected or even the influence of a single season of play. In 2014, our group used a 12‐test online cognitive battery ( www.cambridgebrainsciences.com ) to study the cognitive function of a population of 35 male varsity football athletes in both the pre‐ and post‐season. In comparison to controls, the athletes showed decreased scores in the pre‐season with no pre‐ to post‐season differences. Additionally, athletes’ concussion histories were not correlated with any cognitive measure. Given the positional variation in head impact exposure profiles and CTE diagnoses in football, the objective of the current study is to determine the influence of player position, and thus head impact exposure profile, on cognitive function over the course of a single season as well as the athletes’ careers up until this point. Participants consisted of an overlapping sample of athletes from the same football team for the 2014 and 2015 athletic seasons. Cognitive function was determined using cognitive battery scores and reaction times of players in both the pre‐ and post‐ season. Preliminary results, both aggregated and stratified by position demonstrate there was no difference between pre‐ and post‐season battery scores or reaction times. In accordance with our previous results, this suggests that a single season of head impact exposure does not cause significant cognitive decline. However, when considering all data as a representation of career‐long exposure, results suggest that wide receivers have the fastest reaction times on cognitive tests and consistently outperform their defensive linemen counterparts in terms of battery score. Defensive linemen also demonstrate the most variable reaction times. Previous studies analysing impact magnitude and frequency suggest that defensive linemen sustain significantly more low force hits while the wide receivers endure fewer hits but of high collision forces. Additionally, studies assessing the frequency of CTE diagnosis by position suggest fewer diagnoses in former wide receivers than in defensive linemen. Collectively, these results align well with previously published biomechanical and clinical literature and suggest that there is a continuum of cognitive function impairments across positions and head impact exposure profiles. Better characterization of the relationship between sport‐and position‐specific head impact exposure profiles and cognitive function may help guide participation, coaching strategies, and safe play decisions in sport. Support or Funding Information Research supported by CERC funding awarded to AMO","The paper investigates the relationship between cumulative head impact exposure and cognitive function in football players across different positions. The study finds no significant difference in cognitive scores or reaction times from pre- to post-season, but indicates that wide receivers have better cognitive performance compared to defensive linemen, underscoring the need for tailored approaches in coaching and player safety based on position-specific head impact exposure."
The Prevalence of Depression and Concussions in a Sample of Active North American Semi-Professional and Professional Football Players,2016-03-31,Institute of Lifestyle Medicine,Journal of Lifestyle Medicine,"James Pryor, Abigail Larson, Mark DeBeliso","Background: Concussive events frequently occur in high impact sports such as North American football.The long term effects of concussive events on physical and psychological wellbeing are the focus of ongoing research.The purpose of this study was to determine if concussive events increase the incidence of depression in active semi-professional and professional North American football players.Methods: An anonymous online survey was sent to 200 players to collect the following self-reported data: position played, years played, number of concussions sustained and subsequent depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD-R) scale.An independent T-test was used to determine differences in the number of concussive events in those with CESD-R scores ＜16 vs. ≥16, where scores ≥16 are indicative of a depressed state.Likewise, an independent T-test was used to compare CESD-R scores between players with ≥3 concussions vs. ≤2.Results: Individuals with a CESD-R score ≥16, sustained a significantly greater number of concussions (3.8 vs. 1.6) than those who scored ＜16 (p ＜ 0.001).Further analysis also revealed significantly higher CESD-R scores in players who had sustained ≥3 concussions (24.0 vs. 15.6)than those with ≤2 (p ＜ 0.05). Conclusion:Within the parameters of this study, players that were classified as depressed had sustained significantly more concussions compared to those who were not classified as depressed.Further, multiple concussive events (≥3) appears to increase symptoms of depression.","This study investigates the relationship between concussive events and the incidence of depression among active semi-professional and professional North American football players.

Arthroscopic debridement of the ankle for mild to moderate osteoarthritis: a midterm follow-up study in former professional soccer players,2016-03-30,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Leonardo Osti, Angelo Del Buono, Nicola Maffulli","The aim of this study is to report the clinical and functional outcomes following arthroscopic management of anterior impingement, grade III–IV cartilage lesions, and mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the ankle in former soccer players. The study included 15 former male professional soccer players with mild to moderate degenerative changes of the ankle who had undergone arthroscopic debridement and management of secondary injuries of the ankle. Preoperatively and at the last follow-up, at an average of 7.4 years, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and the Kaikkonen scales and visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment were administered to all patients. Ankle osteoarthritis was assessed from weightbearing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of both ankles. At the last follow-up, the average AOFAS score had increased significantly from 48 (range, 29–69) to 86 (range, 63–94) (P < 0.0001), with good to excellent scores in 11 patients (74 %). The average Kaikkonen preoperative score of 43 (range, 28–70) had significantly improved to 85 (range, 61–95) (P < 0.0001), with good excellent scores in 11 patients (74 %). VAS values were also improved at the last follow-up. At the last appointment, only one (7 %) patient had abandoned altogether any sport, as he did not feel safe with his ankle and he felt too old to continue. Anterior ankle arthroscopy for management of mild to moderate ankle arthritis is safe, effective, and low cost and allows former athletes to safely return to ordinary daily activities and recreational sport activities.","The paper evaluates the clinical and functional outcomes of arthroscopic debridement in former professional soccer players with mild to moderate ankle osteoarthritis.

Sprint running: how changes in step frequency affect running mechanics and leg spring behaviour at maximal speed,2016-03-30,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Andrea Monte, Valentina Muollo, Francesca Nardello, Paola Zamparo","The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in selected biomechanical variables in 80-m maximal sprint runs while imposing changes in step frequency (SF) and to investigate if these adaptations differ based on gender and training level. A total of 40 athletes (10 elite men and 10 women, 10 intermediate men and 10 women) participated in this study; they were requested to perform 5 trials at maximal running speed (RS): at the self-selected frequency (SFs) and at SF ±15% and ±30%SFs. Contact time (CT) and flight time (FT) as well as step length (SL) decreased with increasing SF, while kvert increased with it. At SFs, kleg was the lowest (a 20% decrease at ±30%SFs), while RS was the largest (a 12% decrease at ±30%SFs). Only small changes (1.5%) in maximal vertical force (Fmax) were observed as a function of SF, but maximum leg spring compression (ΔL) was largest at SFs and decreased by about 25% at ±30%SFs. Significant differences in Fmax, Δy, kleg and kvert were observed as a function of skill and gender (P < 0.001).

The Relationship Between Whole-Body External Loading and Body-Worn Accelerometry During Team-Sport Movements,2016-03-22,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Niels J. Nedergaard, Mark A. Robinson, Elena Eusterwiemann, Barry Drust, Paulo J. Lisboa, Jos Vanrenterghem","To investigate the relationship between whole-body accelerations and body-worn accelerometry during team-sport movements.Twenty male team-sport players performed forward running and anticipated 45° and 90° side-cuts at approach speeds of 2, 3, 4, and 5 m/s. Whole-body center-of-mass (CoM) accelerations were determined from ground-reaction forces collected from 1 foot-ground contact, and segmental accelerations were measured from a commercial GPS accelerometer unit on the upper trunk. Three higher-specification accelerometers were also positioned on the GPS unit, the dorsal aspect of the pelvis, and the shaft of the tibia. Associations between mechanical load variables (peak acceleration, loading rate, and impulse) calculated from both CoM accelerations and segmental accelerations were explored using regression analysis. In addition, 1-dimensional statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to explore the relationships between peak segmental accelerations and CoM-acceleration profiles during the whole foot-ground contact.A weak relationship was observed for the investigated mechanical load variables regardless of accelerometer location and task (R2 values across accelerometer locations and tasks: peak acceleration .08-.55, loading rate .27-.59, and impulse .02-.59). Segmental accelerations generally overestimated whole-body mechanical load. SPM analysis showed that peak segmental accelerations were mostly related to CoM accelerations during the first 40-50% of contact phase.While body-worn accelerometry correlates to whole-body loading in team-sport movements and can reveal useful estimates concerning loading, these correlations are not strong. Body-worn accelerometry should therefore be used with caution to monitor whole-body mechanical loading in the field.","This paper investigates the relationship between whole-body accelerations and body-worn accelerometry during various team-sport movements, specifically focusing on forward running and side-cuts. The findings indicate that while body-worn accelerometry can provide insights into whole-body mechanical loading, the correlations are weak, suggesting it should be used cautiously for monitoring such loads in field settings."

Effects of Soccer Heading on Brain Structure and Function,2016-03-21,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Neurology,"Ana Carolina Rodrigues, Rodrigo Pace Lasmar, Paulo Caramelli","Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, with more than 265 million players worldwide, including professional and amateur ones. Soccer is unique in comparison to other sports, as it is the only sport in which participants purposely use their head to hit the ball. Heading is considered an offensive or defensive move whereby the player’s unprotected head is used to deliberately impact the ball and direct it during play. A soccer player can be subjected to an average of six to twelve incidents of heading the ball per competitive game, where the ball reaches high velocities. Moreover, in practice sessions, heading training, which involves heading the ball repeatedly at low velocities, is common. Although the scientific community, as well as the media, has focused on the effects of concussions in contact sports, the role of subconcussive impacts, as it can occur during heading, has recently gained attention, considering that it may represent an additional mechanism of cumulative brain injury. The purpose of this study is to review the existing literature regarding the effects of soccer heading on brain structure and function. Only in the last years some investigations have addressed the impact of heading on brain structure, by using neuroimaging techniques. Similarly, there have been some recent studies investigating biochemical markers of brain injury in soccer players. There is evidence of association between heading and abnormal brain structure, but the data are still preliminary. Also, some studies have suggested that subconcussive head impacts, as heading, could cause cognitive impairment, whereas others have not corroborated this finding. Questions persist as to whether or not heading is deleterious to cognitive functioning. Further studies, especially with longitudinal designs, are needed to clarify the clinical significance of heading as a cause of brain injury and to identify risk factors. Such investigations might contribute to the establishment of safety guidelines that could help to minimize the risk of possible adverse effects of soccer on brain structure and function.","This paper reviews existing literature on the effects of heading in soccer on brain structure and function, highlighting concerns over subconcussive impacts and their potential link to cognitive impairment. It emphasizes the need for further research to establish a clearer understanding of the risks associated with heading and to develop safety guidelines for players."

Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the influences of sex and limb dominance on lower extremity joint mechanics during unilateral land-and-cut manoeuvres. Twenty-one women and 21 men completed land-and-cut manoeuvres on their dominant limb as well as their nondominant limb. Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were calculated bilaterally for the entire stance phase of the manoeuvre. Women performed land-and-cut manoeuvres with altered hip motions and loads as well as greater knee abduction at touchdown compared to men. Dominant limb land-and-cut manoeuvres where characterised by decreased hip flexion at touchdown as well as decreased hip flexion and adduction range of motion compared to nondominant land-and-cuts regardless of sex. The observed sex differences are consistent with previous research regarding mechanisms underlying the sex disparity in anterior cruciate ligament injury rates. However, observed differences regarding limb dominances appear somewhat arbitrary and did not suggest that the dominant or nondominant limb would be at increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury.","This study investigates the effects of sex and limb dominance on lower extremity joint mechanics during unilateral land-and-cut manoeuvres, revealing that women exhibit greater kinematic and kinetic leg asymmetries than men, which may heighten their risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Tsushima, Olga Geling, Monica Arnold, Ross Oshiro","This exploratory study was designed to examine the neuropsychological effects of sports-related head trauma—specifically, repetitive subconcussive impacts or head blows that do not result in a diagnosable concussion. The researchers compared the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) neurocognitive test scores of 2 groups of nonconcussed youth athletes (n = 282), grouped according to the frequency of concussions in their respective sports, with the assumption that more subconcussive impacts occur in sports in which there are more reported concussions. The results indicated that high-contact-sport (football) athletes had significantly poorer performance in processing speed and reaction time compared with athletes in low-contact sports (wrestling, soccer, baseball, judo, and basketball). This study into the effects of repetitive subconcussive head trauma tentatively raises concern that participation in high-contact sports, even without evidence of a diagnosable concussion, could result in lowered neuropsychological functioning among high school athletes. Limitations of this exploratory research effort are discussed.","This exploratory study investigates the neuropsychological effects of non-concussive head impacts in youth athletes, focusing on high-contact sports like football compared to low-contact sports.

Support leg action can contribute to maximal instep soccer kick performance: an intervention study,2016-03-08,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Simon Augustus, Peter Mundy, Neal Smith","This investigation assessed whether a Technique Refinement Intervention designed to produce pronounced vertical hip displacement during the kicking stride could improve maximal instep kick performance. Nine skilled players (age 23.7 ± 3.8 years, height 1.82 ± 0.06 m, body mass 78.5 ± 6.1 kg, experience 14.7 ± 3.8 years; mean ± SD) performed 10 kicking trials prior to (NORM) and following the intervention (INT). Ground reaction force (1000 Hz) and three-dimensional motion analysis (250 Hz) data were used to calculate lower limb kinetic and kinematic variables. Paired t-tests and statistical parametric mapping examined differences between the two kicking techniques across the entire kicking motion. Peak ball velocities (26.3 ± 2.1 m · s−1 vs 25.1 ± 1.5 m · s−1) and vertical displacements of the kicking leg hip joint centre (0.041 ± 0.012 m vs 0.028 ± 0.011 m) were significantly larger (P < 0.025) when performed following INT. Further, various significant changes in support and kicking leg dynamics contributed to a significantly faster kicking knee extension angular velocity through ball contact following INT (70–100% of total kicking motion, P < 0.003). Maximal instep kick performance was enhanced following INT, and the mechanisms presented are indicative of greater passive power flow to the kicking limb during the kicking stride.","The paper investigates the impact of a Technique Refinement Intervention on maximal instep soccer kick performance, focusing on vertical hip displacement during the kicking stride.

Twenty-one futsal players participated in this study and performed a protocol to simulate the futsal demands. At pre-protocol, half-time and post-protocol, the athletes performed 10-m sprints that were recorded for kinematic analysis. Continuous relative phase (CRP) was calculated to assess the inter-segmental coordination. In addition, vertical (KVERT) and leg (KLEG) stiffness were calculated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used (P < 0.05). The main results showed that sprint time increased (P < 0.01) post-protocol when compared to pre- and half-time conditions. Lower values of the step rate (P = 0.01) and higher values of the leg angular velocity (P = 0.02) were verified at the end of the FIRP. The CRP of thigh–leg and leg–foot and the stiffness did not change over the protocol. In addition, the high correlation of CRP between the conditions revealed no changes in coordination pattern. We concluded that futsal related-fatigue induced a decrement on sprint time, changing the kinematics of the lower limbs (decreasing step rate and increasing leg angular velocity). However, neither stiffness nor intersegment coordination during sprints was affected by fatigue.","This paper investigates the impact of fatigue from a futsal-specific protocol on sprint performance and the kinematics of lower limbs in players. The results indicate that fatigue significantly increased sprint times and altered kinematic variables, such as step rate and leg angular velocity, while maintaining inter-segmental coordination and stiffness throughout the protocol."

A total of 17 youth completed the study (41% female, mean 12.6 years). There were 73 head impacts &gt;15 g measured (45% headers) and only 2 had a maximum peak linear acceleration &gt;50 g. No youth reported symptoms consistent with concussion. After correction for multiple comparisons and a sensitivity analysis excluding clear outliers, no significant associations were found between head impact exposure and neuropsychological testing or advanced neuroimaging. The authors conclude that head impacts were relatively uncommon and low in acceleration in youth playing a weekend soccer tournament. This study adds to the limited data regarding head impacts in youth soccer.","This paper investigates the frequency and magnitude of subconcussive head impacts in youth soccer during a weekend tournament, utilizing accelerometry to collect data. The findings reveal that head impacts were infrequent and low in acceleration, with no significant associations observed between head impact exposure and cognitive or neuroimaging outcomes, contributing to the limited understanding of head impact risks in youth soccer."

Test-retest reliability of physiological and performance responses to 120 minutes of simulated soccer match play. J Strength Cond Res 30(11): 3178–3186, 2016—This study investigated the test-retest reliability of physiological and performance responses to 120 minutes (90 minutes plus 30 minutes extra-time [ET]) of the soccer match simulation (SMS). Ten university-standard soccer players completed the SMS on 2 occasions under standardized conditions. Capillary and venous blood was taken pre-exercise, at half-time, and at 90 and 120 minutes, with further capillary samples taken every 15 minutes throughout the exercise. Core temperature (T core ), physical (20- and 15-m sprint speeds and countermovement jump height), and technical (soccer dribbling) performance was also assessed during each trial. All variables except blood lactate demonstrated no systematic bias between trials ( p &gt; 0.05). During the last 15 minutes of ET, test-rest reliability (coefficient of variation %, Pearson's r , respectively) was moderate to strong for 20-m sprint speed (3.5%, 0.71), countermovement jump height (4.9%, 0.90), dribble speed (2.8%, 0.90), and blood glucose (7.1%, 0.93), and very strong for T core (1.2%, 0.99). Moderate reliability was demonstrated for 15-m sprint speed (4.6%, 0.36), dribble precision (11.5%, 0.30), plasma insulin (10.3%, 0.96), creatine kinase ([CK] 28.1%, 0.38), interleukin-6 (24%, 0.99), nonesterified fatty acids ([NEFA] 13.2%, 0.73), glycerol (12.5%, 0.86), and blood lactate (18.6%, 0.79). In the last 15 minutes of ET, concentrations of blood glucose and lactate and sprint and jump performances were reduced, whereas T core , NEFA, glycerol, and CK concentrations were elevated ( p ≤ 0.05). The SMS is a reliable protocol for measuring responses across the full 120 minutes of soccer-specific exercise. Deleterious effects on performance and physiological responses occur during ET.","This study explores the test-retest reliability of physiological and performance responses in soccer during a 120-minute match simulation. Key findings indicate that while most performance variables showed moderate to strong reliability, notable declines in performance and physiological measures occurred during the extra-time phase."
Injury prediction in veteran football players using the Functional Movement Screen™,2016-03-03,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Daniel Hammes, Karen aus der Fünten, Mario Bizzini, Tim Meyer","The Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS™) is aimed at assessing fundamental movements and is often used to identify players' injury risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the FMS™ can be used to predict injuries in veteran footballers (aged > 32 years). Eighteen veteran football teams (n = 238) were recruited and prospectively followed for 9 months. The players (44 ± 7 years; 178 ± 7 cm, 84 ± 11 kg) performed the FMS™ at the start of the study period. Players' exposure hours and injuries were recorded. The difference of FMS™ overall score between injured and uninjured players was not significant (11.7 ± 2.9 vs 12.2 ± 2.8 points; Mann-Whitney U-test P = 0.17). Players scoring <10 (score < 1 standard deviation [SD]) below the mean) had a significantly higher injury incidence (z-statistics P < 0.05) compared to an intermediate reference group (mean ± 1 SD; scores of 10-14). No lower injury incidence for players with scores of >14 (score > 1 SD above the mean) was found. Further analyses of potential risk factors suggest higher age, lower body mass and a longer football career to be risk factors for injuries. The findings of this study suggest that the suitability of the FMS™ for injury prediction in veteran footballers is limited.","This study investigates the effectiveness of the Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS™) in predicting injuries among veteran football players aged over 32 years. The findings indicate that while lower FMS™ scores correlate with increased injury incidence, the overall suitability of the FMS™ for injury prediction in this population is limited, and higher age, lower body mass, and longer career duration are identified as potential injury risk factors."

Different visual stimuli affect body reorientation strategies during sidestepping,2016-03-01,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"M. J. C. Lee, D. G. Lloyd, B. S. Lay, P. D. Bourke, J. A. Alderson","Sidestepping in response to unplanned stimuli is a high‐risk maneuver for anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries. Yet, differences in body reorientation strategies between high‐ and low‐level soccer players prior to sidestepping in response to quasi‐game‐realistic vs non‐game‐realistic stimuli, remain unknown. Fifteen high‐level (semi‐professional) and 15 low‐level (amateur) soccer players responded to a quasi‐game‐realistic one‐defender scenario (1 DS ) and two‐defender scenario (2 DS ), and non‐game‐realistic arrow‐planned condition ( AP ) and arrow‐unplanned condition ( AUNP ). The AP , 1 DS , 2 DS to AUNP represented increasing time constraints to sidestep. Selected biomechanics from the penultimate step to foot‐off were assessed using a mixed‐model (stimuli × skill) ANOVA ( P &lt; 0.05). Step length decreased in the defender scenarios compared with the arrow conditions. Support foot placement increased laterally, away from mid‐pelvis, with increasing temporal constraints. Greater trunk lateral flexion in the 1 DS , 2 DS , and AUNP has been associated with ACL injury onsets. Higher level players pushed off closer to their pelvic midline at initial foot contact in the 2 DS especially. Higher level perception of game‐realistic visual information could have contributed to this safer neuromuscular strategy that, when understood better, could potentially be trained in lower level players to reduce ACL injury risk associated with dangerous sidestepping postures.","This paper investigates how different visual stimuli influence body reorientation strategies during sidestepping maneuvers, which are critical for preventing ACL injuries in soccer. It compares the biomechanics of high-level and low-level players under varying time constraints, revealing that higher-level players exhibit safer movement strategies that could be beneficial for training lower-level players to mitigate injury risks."

Validity and Reliability of a Digital Inclinometer to Assess Knee Joint-Position Sense in a Closed Kinetic Chain,2016-02-26,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Natalia Romero-Franco, Juan Antonio Montaño-Munuera, Pedro Jiménez-Reyes","Context: Knee joint-position sense (JPS) is a key parameter for optimum performance in many sports but is frequently negatively affected by injuries and/or fatigue during training sessions. Although evaluation of JPS may provide key information to reduce the risk of injury, it often requires expensive and/or complex tools that make monitoring proprioceptive deterioration difficult. Objective: To analyze the validity and reliability of a digital inclinometer to measure knee JPS in a closed kinetic chain (CKC). Design: The validity and intertester and intratester reliability of a digital inclinometer for measuring knee JPS were assessed. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Participants: 10 athletes (5 men and 5 women; 26.2 ± 1.3 y, 71.7 ± 12.4 kg; 1.75 ± 0.09 m; 23.5 ± 3.9 kg/m 2 ). Intervention: Knee JPS was measured in a CKC. Main Outcome Measures: Absolute angular error (AAE) of knee JPS in a CKC. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated to determine the validity and reliability of the inclinometer. Data showed that the inclinometer had a high level of validity compared with an isokinetic dynamometer (ICC = 1.0, SEM = 1.39, P &lt; .001), and there was very good intra- and intertester reliability for reading the inclinometer (ICC = 1.0, SEM = 0.85, P &lt; .001). Compared with AutoCAD video analysis, inclinometer validity was very high (ICC = 0.980, SEM = 3.46, P &lt; .001) for measuring AAE during knee JPS in a CKC. In addition, the intertester reliability of the inclinometer for obtaining AAE was very high (ICC = .994, SEM = 1.67, P &lt; .001). Conclusion: The inclinometer provides a valid and reliable method for assessing knee JPS in a CKC.

Previous research showed that collegiate athletes with ACL tears demonstrated slower time to stabilization during jump landing after reconstruction.Collegiate athletes with baseline deficiencies in time to stabilization are at increased risk of subsequent ACL rupture.Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.A total of 278 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I college athletes (166 men, 112 women; mean age, 18.5 years; height, 178.8 cm; mass, 79.9 kg) in the high-risk sports of men's football; women's volleyball and field hockey; and men's and women's lacrosse, basketball, and soccer were measured to obtain baseline time to stabilization for backward, forward, medial, and lateral single-legged jump landing tasks. Athletes were followed for ACL rupture over a 4-year period. Independent t tests were used to evaluate differences in time to stabilization for each jump landing task between athletes with subsequent ACL rupture and uninjured athletes. Logistic regression models were used to assess time to stabilization as a predictor for ACL rupture.Nine athletes sustained noncontact ACL ruptures (5 men, 4 women). These 9 athletes took significantly longer to stabilize compared with uninjured athletes during baseline backward jump landing (1.58 ± 0.39 and 1.09 ± 0.52 seconds, respectively; P = .0052).

Susceptibility to Hamstring Injuries in Soccer,2016-02-24,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Joke Schuermans, Damien Van Tiggelen, Lieven Danneels, Erik Witvrouw","Running-related hamstring strain injuries remain a delicate issue in several sports such as soccer. Their unremittingly high incidence and recurrence rates indicate that the underlying risk has not yet been fully identified. Among other factors, the importance of neuromuscular coordination and the quality of interplay between the different hamstring muscle bellies is thought to be a key determinant within the intrinsic injury risk. Muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging (mfMRI) is one of the tools that has been proven to be valid for evaluating intermuscular coordination.To investigate the risk of sustaining an index or recurring soccer-related hamstring injury by exploring metabolic muscle characteristics using mfMRI.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.A total of 27 healthy male soccer players and 27 soccer players with a history of hamstring injuries underwent standardized mfMRI. The mfMRI protocol consisted of a resting scan, a strenuous bilateral eccentric hamstring exercise, and a postexercise scan. The exercise-related T2 change, or the signal intensity shift between both scans, was used to detect differences in metabolic characteristics between (1) the different hamstring muscle bellies and (2) the prospective cohorts based on the (re)occurrence of hamstring injuries during a follow-up period of 18 months.The risk of sustaining a first hamstring injury was associated with alterations in the intermuscular hierarchy in terms of the magnitude of the metabolic response after a heavy eccentric effort, with the dominant role of the semitendinosus set aside for a higher contribution of the biceps femoris (P = .017). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that this variable was significantly able to predict the occurrence of index injuries with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 70% when the metabolic activity of the biceps femoris exceeded 10%. The risk of sustaining a reinjury was associated with a substantial deficit in hamstring strength endurance (P = .031). Soccer players who sustained a reinjury were only able to perform prone leg curls for a mean duration of 146.50 ± 76.16 seconds, whereas those with an injury history but no recurrence during follow-up were able to continue for a mean of 237.45 ± 110.76 seconds (95% CI, 11.9-230.5 seconds; P = .031).This was the first study to assess the causal relation between the intramuscular recruitment pattern and the risk of sustaining an index or secondary hamstring strain. Changes in intermuscular interplay seem to significantly increase the risk of sustaining index hamstring injuries in male amateur soccer players. Inadequate eccentric muscle endurance could be associated with an increased risk of sustaining a recurring hamstring injury.","This paper investigates the risk factors for hamstring injuries in soccer, specifically focusing on neuromuscular coordination and intermuscular recruitment dynamics. Using muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging (mfMRI), the study finds that altered metabolic responses and inadequate eccentric muscle endurance increase the risk of both initial and recurrent hamstring injuries among male amateur soccer players."
Performance on the Functional Movement Screen Is Related to Hop Performance But Not to Hip and Knee Strength in Collegiate Football Players,2016-02-17,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Nienke Willigenburg, Timothy E.

We recorded total FMS score, peak strength, and hop performance, and we calculated asymmetries between legs on the different tasks. Spearman correlation coefficients quantified the relationships between these measures, and χ analyses compared the number of athletes with asymmetries on the different tasks.We observed significant correlations (r = 0.38-0.56, P ≤ 0.02) between FMS scores and hop distance but not between FMS scores and hip or knee strength (all P ≥ 0.21). The amount of asymmetry on the FMS test was significantly correlated to the amount of asymmetry on the timed 6-m hop (r = 0.44, P < 0.01) but not to hip or knee strength asymmetries between limbs (all P ≥ 0.34).Functional Movement Screen score was positively correlated to hop distance, and limb asymmetry in FMS tasks was correlated to limb asymmetry in 6-m hop time in football players. No significant correlations were observed between FMS score and hip and knee strength or between FMS asymmetry and asymmetries in hip and knee strength between limbs. These results indicate that a simple hop for distance test may be a time-efficient and cost-efficient alternative to FMS testing in athletes and that functional asymmetries between limbs do not coincide with strength asymmetries.","This paper investigates the relationship between Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores, hop performance, and lower limb strength in collegiate football players.

Power production is believed to provide a foundation for these speed qualities. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of change of direction speed, acceleration, and maximal velocity to both the counter movement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) in collegiate soccer players. Thirty-six NCAA Division II soccer players (20 males and 16 females) were tested for speed over 10 and 30 m, CODS (T-test, pro agility) and power (CMJ, SJ). Independent t-tests (p ≤ 0.05) were used to derive gender differences, and Pearson's correlations (p ≤ 0.05) calculated relationships between the different power and speed tests. Female subjects displayed moderate-to-strong correlations between 30 m, pro agility and T-test with the CMJ (r = -0.502 to -0.751), and SJ (r = -0.502 to -0.681). Moderate correlations between 10 and 30 m with CMJ (r = -0.476 and -0.570) and SJ (r = -0.443 and -0.553, respectively) were observed for males. Moderate to strong relationships exist between speed and power attributes in both male and female collegiate soccer players, especially between CMJ and maximal velocity.

Methods Head impact data were gathered from 33 Division I National Collegiate Athletic Association football players. Twenty-four concussions were identified and matched with impacts of similar kinematic and injury criterion values (linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, Gadd severity index, and head injury criterion) that occurred during the same event type (game, practice, or scrimmage). In addition, these same matching criteria were used to match all players to the closest kinematic/same player group. All impacts within a session before the impact of interest (concussive or matched impact) were analyzed. Results On days of diagnosed concussion, the concussive group sustained a lower percentage of impacts to the front of the head (34.5%) and a greater frequency of impacts to the sides (19.6%) and top (18.9%) of the head (χ2(3) = 10.23, P = 0.017) as compared with the matched nonconcussive group (front = 42.5%, sides = 16.6%, top = 14.0%). No significant difference in frequency was found in impacts to the back of the head. Conclusion It may be more difficult to mitigate concussive forces sustained in impacts to the top and sides of the head than the front of the head. These findings fall in line with previous research demonstrating that reduced impact magnitudes may lessen concussion risk. Studying appropriate training paradigms to develop safer playing techniques on the field is warranted.","This study examines the relationship between head impact location and the incidence of diagnosed concussions in college football players. Key findings indicate that on days when concussions were diagnosed, impacts were more frequently sustained to the sides and top of the head compared to the front, suggesting that mitigating concussive forces in these areas may be more challenging."
The Vertical Drop Jump Is a Poor Screening Test for ACL Injuries in Female Elite Soccer and Handball Players,2016-02-11,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Tron Krosshaug, Kathrin Steffen, Eirik Kristianslund, Agnethe Nilstad, Kam-Ming Mok, Grethe Myklebust, Thor Einar Andersen, Ingar Holme, Lars Engebretsen, Roald Bahr","Background: The evidence linking knee kinematics and kinetics during a vertical drop jump (VDJ) to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk is restricted to a single small sample. Still, the VDJ test continues to be advocated for clinical screening purposes. Purpose: To test whether 5 selected kinematic and kinetic variables were associated with future ACL injuries in a large cohort of Norwegian female elite soccer and handball players. Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether the VDJ test can be recommended as a screening test to identify players with increased risk. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Elite female soccer and handball players participated in preseason screening tests from 2007 through 2014. The tests included marker-based 3-dimensional motion analysis of a drop-jump landing. We followed a predefined statistical protocol in which we included the following candidate risk factors in 5 separate logistic regression analyses, with new ACL injury as the outcome: (1) knee valgus angle at initial contact, (2) peak knee abduction moment, (3) peak knee flexion angle, (4) peak vertical ground-reaction force, and (5) medial knee displacement. Results: A total of 782 players were tested (age, 21 ± 4 years; height, 170 ± 7 cm; body mass, 67 ± 8 kg), of which 710 were included in the analyses. We registered 42 new noncontact ACL injuries, including 12 in previously ACL-injured players. Previous ACL injury (relative risk, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.1-7.1) and medial knee displacement (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.74 per 1-SD change) were associated with increased risk for injury. However, among the 643 players without previous injury, we found no association with medial knee displacement. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of medial knee displacement showed an area under the curve of 0.6, indicating a poor-to-failed combined sensitivity and specificity of the test, even when including previously injured players. Conclusion: Of the 5 risk factors considered, medial knee displacement was the only factor associated with increased risk for ACL. However, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated a poor combined sensitivity and specificity when medial knee displacement was used as a screening test for predicting ACL injury. For players with no previous injury, none of the VDJ variables were associated with increased injury risk. Clinical Relevance: VDJ tests cannot predict ACL injuries in female elite soccer and handball players.","The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the vertical drop jump (VDJ) as a screening test for predicting anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female elite soccer and handball players. It finds that while medial knee displacement is associated with injury risk, the overall poor sensitivity and specificity of the VDJ test suggests it is not a reliable method for identifying players at increased risk of ACL injuries."
Single-leg postural stability deficits following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in pediatric and adolescent athletes,2016-02-11,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics B,"Dai Sugimoto, David R. Howell, Lyle J. Micheli, William P. Meehan","The objective of this study was to compare the postural stability of pediatric and adolescent athletes without anterior cruciate ligament injury with those who underwent anterior cruciate reconstruction (ACLR). Postural stability ratings derived from a video-force plate system during the three stances of the modified Balance Error Scoring System were collected from pediatric and adolescent athletes who underwent ACLR (N=24; mean 1.2 years after surgery) and from uninjured controls (N=479). The postural control rating was calculated as the mean of the displacement and variance of the torso and center of pressure data, normalized on a scale from 0 to 100. A higher rating indicates greater postural stability. Participants who underwent ACLR showed lower postural stability ratings during single-leg stance compared with uninjured controls (40.0 vs. 48.7; P=0.037). ACLR is associated with deficits in postural stability.","The paper investigates postural stability in pediatric and adolescent athletes by comparing those who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with uninjured controls.

Arthrodesis of the Subtalar Joint in a High School Football Player With a Talocalcaneal Coalition,2016-02-09,SAGE Publications,Foot &amp; Ankle Specialist,"John Winslow, Ryan Norland, Nathan Storb, Sam Cannella, Deborah King","Tarsal coalition is a bony or fibrous bridge between 2 tarsal bones. The condition is typically congenital and presents in early to mid-adolescence. Common symptoms include ankle pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Conservative treatment of tarsal coalition consists of immobilization, short leg walking cast, steroid injections, physical therapy, ankle braces, and orthotics. When conservative care fails, surgical intervention for tarsal coalition includes excision of the coalition or joint arthrodesis. We present a case of a high school football player with a 5-year history of left ankle pain secondary to a talocalcaneal coalition. The athlete did not respond favorably to conservative treatment and underwent a subtalar joint arthrodesis. Prior to surgery, the athlete consented to self-reported functional outcome measures, range of motion measures, and 3D video gait analysis to evaluate the effects of surgery. Measurements were taken prior to surgery and 1½ years after surgery. Clinically significant improvements were seen in subjective outcome measures and functional ankle range of motion in this case. There is limited research available to validate long-term outcomes for current conservative and surgical treatments of tarsal coalition. In this case, joint arthrodesis resulted in a good long-term outcome for this athlete. Levels of Evidence: Therapeutic, Level IV: Case study","This paper presents a case study of a high school football player diagnosed with a talocalcaneal coalition who underwent subtalar joint arthrodesis after failing conservative treatments. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in subjective outcomes and functional ankle range of motion 1½ years post-surgery, highlighting a potentially effective surgical intervention for this condition despite limited existing research on long-term outcomes."
Is Heading in Youth Soccer Dangerous Play?,2016-02-02,Informa UK Limited,The Physician and Sportsmedicine,John W. O’Kane,"Soccer is among the most popular youth sports with over 3 million youth players registered in the U.S. Soccer is unique in that players intentionally use their head to strike the ball, leading to concerns that heading could cause acute or chronic brain injury, especially in the immature brains of children.Pub Med search without date restriction was conducted in November 2014 and August 2015 using the terms soccer and concussion, heading and concussion, and youth soccer and concussion. 310 articles were identified and reviewed for applicable content specifically relating to youth athletes, heading, and/or acute or chronic brain injury from soccer.Soccer is a low-risk sport for catastrophic head injury, but concussions are relatively common and heading often plays a role. At all levels of play, concussions are more likely to occur in the act of heading than with other facets of the game. While concussion from heading the ball without other contact to the head appears rare in adult players, some data suggests children are more susceptible to concussion from heading primarily in game situations. Contributing factors include biomechanical forces, less developed technique, and the immature brain's susceptibility to injury.There is no evidence that heading in youth soccer causes any permanent brain injury and there is limited evidence that heading in youth soccer can cause concussion. A reasonable approach based on U.S. Youth Soccer recommendations is to teach heading after age 10 in controlled settings, and heading in games should be delayed until skill acquisition and physical maturity allow the youth player to head correctly with confidence.","The paper examines the risks associated with heading in youth soccer, focusing on its potential link to acute or chronic brain injury. Although soccer poses a low risk for catastrophic head injuries, concussions are more prevalent during heading scenarios, particularly in children, leading to recommendations for delayed heading instruction until after age 10 to ensure proper technique and physical maturity."
The effect of fatigue and duration knowledge of exercise on kicking performance in soccer players,2016-02-02,Elsevier BV,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Ricardo Manuel Pires Ferraz, Roland van den Tillaar, Ana Pereira, Mário C. Marques","The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of fatigue upon kicking maximal ball velocity and the target-hitting accuracy of soccer players; and also to examine the effect of the knowledge of the exercise duration upon these 2 parameters.Twenty-four semi-professional soccer players participated in this study and performed maximal instep kicks before and after the implementation of an exercise protocol, either with or without knowledge of the duration of this protocol.A mixed model of analysis of variance showed that kicking maximal ball velocity was significantly affected (F(5, 85) = 11.6, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.39) but only after just 1 circuit of the fatigue protocol and then remained similar. Accuracy did not change during the protocol (F(5, 75) = 0.23, p = 0.76, η2 = 0.03) and knowing the duration of exercitation did not affect accuracy and velocity development (F(1, 23) ≤ 1.04, p ≥ 0.32, η2 ≤ 0.06).These findings demonstrated the potential negative effects of fatigue on kicking ball velocity in soccer but not in the kicking accuracy and that the effect of fatigue may not be progressive over time. Knowing or not knowing the duration of exercitation did not affect the results.","This study investigates how fatigue and the knowledge of exercise duration influence kicking performance in soccer players, focusing on maximal ball velocity and target-hitting accuracy. The findings reveal that while fatigue significantly impacts kicking velocity, it does not affect accuracy, and the knowledge of exercise duration has no effect on either parameter."

The participants were familiarized with the jump and then the CMJ height reliability was quantified to determine the MID. Countermovement jump height was assessed in the pretesting session (T0), at the end of 4 weeks of intensified training (T1), and after 2 weeks of tapering (T2). Eighteen national level U17 male futsal players were randomly allocated into the regulated group (RG; n = 9) and the control group (CG; n = 9). The RG performed 6 weeks of training with the training load regulated by mean height of CMJ with MID, whereas the CG performed the preplanned training. The differences between groups and across time points were compared by a 2-way analysis of variance. In the RG, the MID loading was increased in weeks 3 and 4 (8.2 and 14.5%, respectively; p < 0.001) compared with the preplanned loading of the CG during the overreaching phase. In the jump results, the RG significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced CMJ height during T1 (effect size [ES] = -0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.58 to -0.02); however, there were no significant changes in the CG jump height at T1 and T2. At T2, the RG significantly increased CMJ height above baseline (ES = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.51). Researchers and practitioners could use this autoregulating method to regulate and monitor training load to achieve functional overreaching in youth futsal players.","This paper investigates the use of autoregulating jump performance through the minimal individual difference (MID) related to countermovement jump (CMJ) height to manage training loads for inducing functional overreaching in U17 male futsal players.

Purpose: To evaluate the effects of an injury prevention program on movement technique and peak vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) over time compared with a standard warm-up (SWU) program. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 1104 incoming freshmen (age range, 17-22 years) at a military academy in the United States volunteered to participate. Participants were cluster-randomized by military company to either the Dynamic Integrated Movement Enhancement (DIME) injury prevention program or SWU. A random subsample of participants completed a standardized jump-landing task at each time point: immediately before the intervention (PRE), immediately after (POST), and 2 (POST2M), 4 (POST4M), 6 (POST6M), and 8 months (POST8M) after the intervention. VGRF data collected during the jump-landing task were normalized to body weight (%BW). The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) was used to evaluate movement technique during the jump landing. The change scores (Δ) for each variable (LESS, VGRF) between the group’s average value at PRE and each time point were calculated. Separate univariate analyses of variance were performed to evaluate group differences. Results: The results showed a greater decrease in mean (±SD) VGRF in the DIME group compared with the SWU group at all retention time points: POST2M (SWU [Δ %BW ], −0.13 ± 0.82; DIME, −0.62 ± 0.91; P = .001), POST4M (SWU, −0.15 ± 0.98; DIME,−0.46 ± 0.64; P = .04), POST6M (SWU, −0.04 ± 0.96; DIME, −0.53 ± 0.83; P = .004), and POST8M (SWU, 0.38 ± 0.95; DIME, −0.11 ± 0.98; P = .003), but there was not a significant improvement in the DIME group between PRE and POST8M (Δ %BW , −0.11 ± 0.98). No group differences in Δ LESS were observed. Conclusion: The study findings demonstrated that an injury prevention program performed as a warm-up can reduce vertical ground-reaction forces compared with a standard warm-up but a maintenance program is likely necessary in order for continued benefit. Clinical Relevance: Injury prevention programs may need to be performed constantly, or at least every sport season, in order for participants to maintain the protective effects against injury.","This paper evaluates the long-term effects of an injury prevention program on landing technique and peak vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) in comparison to a standard warm-up.

The South Grandstand of the Pascual Guerrero Olympic Stadium in Cali, Colombia, has been the traditional stand for the rowdiest groups of fans during the soccer season, making it ideal for studies on human-structure interaction and structural reliability. This paper describes the analysis of the structural reliability of the grandstand using serviceability limit states recommended in international standards,. The methodology included the characterization of the dynamic response of the structure during several soccer matches, the formulation of the load functions for people jumping, simulations of the location of spectators in the stand using fuzzy logic and the incorporation of this information in a finite element model that was updated with experimental results. Structural reliability indexes were obtained for the response of the grandstand to anthropic loads.","This paper examines the structural reliability of the South Grandstand of the Pascual Guerrero Olympic Stadium under dynamic loads generated by crowds during soccer matches.

Roberti, M. Vettor, P. di Prampero","In recent years, advances in GPS technology combined with a better understanding of the energetics of accelerated and decelerated running [5] have made it possible to estimate: i) the time course of the instantaneous metabolic power requirement of any given player in soccer, as well as in other team sports [12], and ii) to infer from this information the time course of the actual O2 consumption (V̇+O2), on the basis of some specific assumptions concerning the VO2 on- and off-responses during metabolic transients (see below and [4]). However, in a recent paper Buchheit et al. compared metabolic power assessment by mean of GPS to direct O2 uptake measurements via a portable metabolic cart, and on the basis of the data obtained, questioned the validity of metabolic power assessment [1]. The following paragraphs discuss Buchheit et al.'s results [1] in some detail, with the aim of arriving at a clear-cut picture of the overall energy expenditure during any given time period of the match or training session. In essence, this exercise will lend further support to the general validity of metabolic power and O2 consumption estimate via GPS, albeit within the limits of the underlying data collection technology and physiological assumptions.","The paper discusses the estimation of metabolic power and oxygen consumption in soccer and other team sports, highlighting advancements in GPS technology that enable this analysis.

Predicting football injuries using size and ratio of the multifidus and quadratus lumborum muscles,2016-01-06,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"J. A. Hides, W. R. Stanton","Deficits in muscles of the lumbo‐pelvic region, such as a relatively small multifidus muscle, have been used to predict lower limb injuries in professional football players. Results have been less consistent for the size of the quadratus lumborum ( QL ) muscle. Changes in size of the multifidus and QL muscles could be functionally related to each other, and modeling this relationship could improve prediction of lower limb injuries. Ultrasound imaging examinations were performed on male elite football players at the start of the Australian Football League ( AFL ) pre‐season and playing season. Injury data were obtained from records collected by each club. Results indicated that the cross‐sectional area of the multifidus muscle was related to the occurrence of an injury in the pre‐season (odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.08/cm 2 decrease below the mean; OR for dichotomized measure = 12.2) and in the season ( OR = 2.43/cm 2 ). The size of the QL muscle was significantly related to an injury in the pre‐season ( OR = 2.12/cm 2 increase above the mean; OR for dichotomized measure = 7.26) but not in the season. A significant link was found between the ratio of the multifidus and QL muscles, and the incidence of pre‐season ( OR = 14.71) and season injuries ( OR = 5.29). The sensitivity and specificity of the model in the pre‐season were 75% and 85.7%, respectively; values for the playing season were 88.4% and 62.5%. A model was developed for prediction of lower limb injuries in football players. Combining size measurements of the multifidus and QL muscles improved predictive power. This information may have clinical implications for injury screening and prevention.","The paper investigates the relationship between the size of the multifidus and quadratus lumborum muscles and the prediction of lower limb injuries in professional football players. It finds that both muscle sizes and their ratio can significantly predict injuries, suggesting that integrating these measurements could enhance injury screening and prevention strategies."
Reliability of accelerometry to assess impact loads of jumping and landing tasks,2016-01-02,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Chantal Simons, Elizabeth J.

The current study aimed to establish the intra-day and inter-day reliability of a tri-axial accelerometer to assess impact loading during jumping and landing tasks. Twelve participants wore an accelerometer on their upper and lower back. They performed a continuous hopping task as well as drop landings and rebound jumps from three drop heights (37.5, 57.5 and 77.5 cm), peak resultant acceleration (PRA) was calculated for all tasks. The tasks were performed twice, one week apart at the same time of day. The difference in the mean, intra-class correlation coefficient, coefficient of variation and Cohen's effect size were calculated as measures of reliability. PRA showed good intra-day reliability for the hopping task. Inter-day reliability of the PRA was moderate to good across all tasks. Reliability of PRA was slightly higher when accelerations were recorded on the lower back compared to the upper back. To assess impact loading, during continuous hopping, drop landings and rebound jumps, PRA recorded at both the upper and lower back appears to be a reliable measure.","The paper investigates the reliability of a tri-axial accelerometer in assessing impact loads during various jumping and landing tasks, aiming to aid in the prevention of overuse injuries in high-performance sports.

A Comparison of Novel and Conventional Fabrication Methods for Auxetic Foams for Sports Safety Applications,2016-01-01,Elsevier BV,Procedia Engineering,"Olly Duncan, Leon Foster, Terry Senior, Tom Allen, Andrew Alderson","This study compares fabrication methods for auxetic foam intended for use in sports safety equipment. Thermo-mechanical conversion methods were applied using: i) cubic moulds (150x150x150 mm), ii) cuboidal moulds (150x150x30 mm) & iii) cuboidal moulds (150x150x30 mm) with through-thickness pins. The cuboidal moulds having one reduced dimension relative to the cubic moulds enable faster heat transfer and more consistent through-thickness compression to the foam during conversion. The through-thickness pins allow greater control of in-plane compression throughout the bulk of the converted foam. Samples were compared using: i) density measurements and measurements of total surface folding (length multiplied by depth), ii) quasi-static compressive load/unload tests to obtain specific strain energy, stress/strain relationship and Poisson's ratio, iii) impact testing on a bespoke drop rig based on a standard for cricket pads (BS 6183-3: 2000, EN 2001) at 5, 10 and 15 J & iv) microscopic images of dissected samples to confirm their auxetic (re-entrant) structure. Samples fabricated in cuboidal moulds show less variation in final density, axial compressive stiffness and specific strain energy between samples than those cut from monoliths fabricated in cubic moulds. Samples created with through-thickness pins exhibited reduced surface folding. Greater control over final properties paves the way for further work designing auxetic foams for sport safety equipment.","This paper evaluates different fabrication methods for auxetic foams used in sports safety equipment, highlighting the advantages of cuboidal moulds and through-thickness pins in achieving consistent material properties. Key findings include improved density uniformity, reduced surface folding, and the potential for enhanced design of safety equipment through controlled foam characteristics."
Relationship between Lower Limb Angular Kinematic Variables and the Effectiveness of Sprinting during the Acceleration Phase,2016-01-01,Wiley,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,"Artur Struzik, Grzegorz Konieczny, Mateusz Stawarz, Kamila Grzesik, Sławomir Winiarski, Andrzej Rokita","The ability to reach a high running velocity over a short distance is essential to a high playing performance in team games. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between running time over a 10-meter section of a 30-meter sprint along a straight line and changes in the angle and angular velocity that were observed in the ankle, knee, and hip joints. The possible presence may help to optimize motion efficiency during acceleration sprint phase. Eighteen girls involved in team sports were examined in the study. The Fusion Smart Speed System was employed for running time measurements. The kinematic data were recorded using the Noraxon MyoMotion system. Statistically significant relationships were found between running time over a 10-meter section and the kinematic variables of hip and ankle joints. An excessively large flexion in hip joints might have an unfavorable effect on running time during the acceleration phase. Furthermore, in order to minimize running time during the acceleration phase, stride should be maintained along a line (a straight line) rather than from side to side. It is also necessary to ensure an adequate range of motion in the hip and ankle joints with respect to the sagittal axis.","This study investigates the relationship between lower limb angular kinematic variables and sprinting effectiveness during the acceleration phase in team sports athletes. Key findings indicate that significant correlations exist between running times and kinematic variables at the hip and ankle joints, suggesting that optimal hip and ankle motion can enhance sprint performance."

We identified communication and processing as two main possible obstacles for high performance real-time biofeedback systems. We give special attention to the role of high performance computing with some details on possible usage of DataFlow computing paradigm. Motion tracking systems, in connection with the biomechanical biofeedback, help in accelerating motor learning. Requirements about various parameters important in real-time biofeedback applications are discussed. Inertial sensor tracking system accuracy is tested in comparison with a high performance optical tracking system. Special focus is given on feedback loop delays. Real-time sensor signal acquisitions and real-time processing challenges, in connection with biomechanical biofeedback, are presented. Despite the fact that local processing requires less energy consumption than remote processing, many other limitations, most often the insufficient local processing power, can lead to distributed system as the only possible option. A multiuser signal processing in football match is recognised as an example for high performance application that needs high-speed communication and high performance remote computing. DataFlow computing is found as a good choice for real-time biofeedback systems with large data streams.","This paper explores the technological challenges associated with implementing real-time biofeedback systems in sports, focusing on communication and processing issues.

A sagittal-view movie camera and force plate were time synchronized. Trunk and lower extremity sagittal angles were measured 100 ms before initial contact and at peak vertical ground reaction force. Peak vertical ground reaction force, time between initial contact and peak vertical ground reaction force, and loading rate were calculated. [Results] The mean sagittal angle was 40.7° ± 7.7° for knee flexion during the flight phase and 16.4° ± 6.3° for pelvic anterior inclination during the landing phase. The mean peak vertical ground reaction force was four times the body weight. The median time to peak vertical ground reaction force was 63.8 ms.

[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 24 collegiate soccer players without pain or dysfunction. To compare the differences between the stable and unstable sides during single-leg drop landing, 8 motion analysis cameras and a force plate were used. The Cortex 4 software was used for a biomechanical analysis of 3 events. An independent t-test was used for statistical comparison between both sides; p<0.05 indicated significance. [Results] The knee joint movements showed gradual flexion in the sagittal plane. The unstable-side ankle joint showed plantar flexion of approximately 2° relative to the stable side. In the coronal plane, the unstable-side knee joint differed from the stable side in its tendency for valgus movement. The unstable-side ankle joint showed contrasting movement compared with the stable side, and the difference was significant. Regarding the vertical ground reaction force, the stable side showed maximum knee flexion that was approximately 0.1 BW lower than that of the unstable side.

Ankle bracing effects on knee and hip mechanics during landing on inclined surfaces,2016-01-01,Informa UK Limited,International Biomechanics,"Ilias Theodorakos, Jan Rueterbories, Morten E. Lund, Michael S. Andersen, Mark de Zee, Uwe G. Kersting","Knee and hip alignment and knee moments during landing are considered risk factors for knee injuries while ankle bracing has been demonstrated to alter landing kinematics and kinetics at these joints. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a semi-rigid ankle brace has an effect on knee and hip kinematics and kinetics during landing on uneven surfaces. Seventeen recreational athletes performed a landing task on a randomly inclined platform with and without an ankle brace. Three different surface alignments were generated: everted, neutral, and inverted. Ground reaction forces (GRF), kinematics, and brace reaction forces were measured. Two independent variables were tested: the brace factor (braced and non-braced) and the inclination factor (everted, neutral, and inverted). Seven separate 2 × 3 repeated measures MANOVAs were employed to compare GRF, knee, and hip initial angles and range of motion (ROM), knee, and hip forces and moments. Participants landed with a more flexed knee and hip during the brace condition, followed by a knee ROM reduction. No differences were observed for the kinetic variables. Landing on the inverted surface resulted in increased peak magnitudes of the vertical and the mediolateral GRF compared to landing on the neutral surface. Landing on the everted surface caused higher knee and hip abduction moments during early contact. Results confirm that ankle bracing may affect the kinematics of the whole lower extremity with no effect on knee or hip loading. Landing on uneven surfaces may increase injury risk, but no adverse effects were shown for wearing the brace.","This study examines the effects of a semi-rigid ankle brace on knee and hip mechanics during landing on inclined surfaces, particularly focusing on how bracing alters kinematic variables. Findings indicate that while knee and hip alignment changes occur with bracing, particularly during landings on uneven surfaces, there is no significant impact on the kinetic variables associated with these joints."

First, the collision motion of players was reproduced based on the video by using motion analysis, and the translational and rotational velocities, relative position and contact location of the struck and the striking players' heads just before the collision were calculated. Then the data obtained were input to two helmeted finite element (FE) human head models as the initial condition, and the brain injury risk was evaluated by using the impact analysis. The FE helmet model was validated by a drop test of the helmet in which the head impactor was embedded. In the present study, two concussion suspected accident cases were analyzed; then the concussion was evaluated by ten mechanical parameters generated inside the skull caused by the collision. The injury risk evaluated by multi parameters belonged to the dangerous range that may cause concussion and was consistent with the diagnosis of the medical team doctor. The brain injury risk can be successfully estimated by the reconstructed simulation of the game video and FE analysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt in Japan to estimate the brain injury risk systematically by a combination of game video analysis which is originally introduced for the players' health care and FE analysis by helmeted human head model. In the future, brain injury risk caused by an accident can be evaluated with higher accuracy by analyzing more accident cases.","The paper estimates the risk of brain injury in collegiate football players by analyzing game video of concussion-suspected incidents and simulating collision impacts using finite element (FE) analysis. Key findings indicate that the injury risk assessed through mechanical parameters aligns with clinical diagnoses, marking a novel approach in Japan to integrate video analysis with biomechanical modeling for evaluating concussion risks."

Thomas","In this study a skilled soccer player performed throws for maximum distance while manipulating the backspin on the ball. A video analysis was used to obtain measures of the ball projection variables. We found that putting greater backspin on the ball did not reduce the player's ability to produce a high projection velocity. Throw distance increased at a rate of about 0.6 m per 1 rev/s increase in backspin, and the experimental data was consistent with the predictions of a mathematical model. We recommend players apply the highest possible backspin when performing a long throw-in.","This paper investigates the influence of ball spin rate on the distance achieved in long soccer throw-ins.

Low, Sharon J. Dixon","This investigation explored how shock-pad density and footwear cushioning influences soccer players' biomechanics. Ten participants (20.9 ± 2.5 yrs, 83.2 ± 7.1 kg, UK footwear size 10-11) wore three footwear cushioning conditions (soccer boot, soccer boot with cushioning insole and soccer boot with heel insert). Each footwear condition was tested on two shock-pad densities (55 g/litre and 65 g/litre) beneath a third generation carpet. For each footwear-shock-pad combination, eight running trials (3.81 m/s) and eight turning trials (consistent self-selected speeds) were collected. Pressure insole data were collected to provide a measure of player loading at impact and propulsion. Repeated measures ANOVAs demonstrated no main effects of footwear. The greater surface density did however, significantly increase (p < 0.05) measurements associated with loading during running (first metatarsal peak pressure) and turning (peak impact force, lateral heel and first metatarsal peak pressure). These findings suggest that shock-pad density is important in the regulation of player loading.","This paper examines the impact of shock-pad density and footwear cushioning on the loading experienced by soccer players during running and turning movements.

Acute Achilles Paratendinopathy following Major Injury of the Crural Fascia in a Professional Soccer Player: A Possible Correlation?,2016-01-01,Wiley,Case Reports in Orthopedics,"Gabriele Mattiussi, Michele Turloni, Pietro Tobia Baldassi, Carlos Moreno","Background. The anatomy and mechanical properties of the Crural Fascia (CF), the ubiquitous connective tissue of the posterior region of the leg, have recently been investigated. The most important findings are that (i) the CF may suffer structural damage from indirect trauma, (ii) structural changes of the CF may affect the biomechanics of tissues connected to it, causing myofascial pain syndromes, and (iii) the CF is in anatomical continuity with the Achilles paratenon. Consistent with these points, the authors hypothesize that the onset of acute Achilles paratendinopathy may be related to histological and biomechanical changes of the CF. Case Presentation. A professional male football player suffered an isolated injury of the CF, interposed between the soleus and medial gastrocnemius (an atypical site of injury) with structural connective integrity of the muscles. After participating in the first official match, two and a half months after the trauma, he has unexpectedly demonstrated the clinical picture of acute Achilles paratendinopathy in the previously injured limb. Conclusions. Analysis of this case suggests that the acute Achilles paratendinopathy may be a muscle injury complication from indirect trauma of the calf muscle, if a frank and extensive involvement of the CF were to be ascertained.","The paper investigates a case of acute Achilles paratendinopathy following an injury to the crural fascia in a professional soccer player.

The Effect of Shoe Weight on Sprint Performance: A Biomechanical Perspective,2016-01-01,OMICS Publishing Group,Journal of Ergonomics,"Maurice Mohra, Hendrik Endersa","Background: The benefit of light-weight shoes for athletic performance has been recognized in both sport and professional environments. However, the biomechanical mechanism by which reduced shoe weight improves athletic performance is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of basketball shoe weight on performance and corresponding lower-extremity biomechanics for the example of a 10 m sprint start.
Methods: For twenty-two male recreational athletes, sprint start (3.7 m) and 10 m sprint performances were quantified from timing lights in three basketball shoe conditions (light=352 g; medium=510 g; heavy=637 g). Ground reaction forces and kinematics and kinetics of the lower-extremity joints during the first sprinting stride were determined using 3D-motion analysis and a force platform. A Support Vector Machine analysis and linear regression were performed to analyze biomechanical differences between the shoe conditions and their association with performance. Results: Average sprint start and 10 m sprint times in the light shoe were significantly reduced compared to the heavy shoe by up to 24 ms (3%) and 32 ms (1.8%), respectively. The reduction in shoe weight led to significantly different ankle joint biomechanics with a 5% increase in peak plantarflexion velocity in the light shoe that was associated with a decrease in sprint start time.
Conclusion: Lighter basketball shoes enhance sprint start performance, likely by facilitating faster ankle plantarflexion during the first sprinting stride. This mechanism can promote player performance during important game scenarios and encourages further innovative light-weight shoe concepts not only in sports but also in working environments that require high athletic performance.","This paper investigates the impact of basketball shoe weight on sprint performance and associated lower-extremity biomechanics during a 10 m sprint start.

ACL intervention programs aim to reduce injury risk by improving strength, flexibility and neuromuscular control. Video feedback interventions have shown success in improving jump-landing biomechanics in a laboratory setting; however, ACL injury prevention programs have yet to incorporate video feedback interventions. Aim: Examine if the addition of video feedback to a modified Sportsmetrics© ACL injury prevention program would produce biomechanical changes in collegiate female soccer athletes during landing. Methods: Hip and knee biomechanics were collected during landing pre- and post-intervention. Participants were allocated into feedback or control groups. All participants completed a 9 week modified Sportsmetrics© ACL intervention program. The feedback group received individualized feedback on their performance of the squat jump task once a week for 6 weeks. Results: No significant differences were observed between groups for any knee or hip biomechanical variables. Discussion: The task chosen for feedback, caliber of athletes,surface on which the athletes completed the jump-landing task and participant’s lack of previous experience with feedback may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance. Conclusion: Six video feedback sessions may not be enough exposure to produce biomechanical changes. Additionally, feedback should be provided on tasks prone to biomechanical errors (e.g., single leg landing) in order to receive the most benefit from the feedback intervention.
