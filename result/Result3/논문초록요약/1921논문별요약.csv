Groin Injuries in Soccer: Investigating the Effect of Age on Adductor Muscle Forces,2019-12-31,,,,"ABSTRACT Purpose The sudden rise in the injury incidence during adolescence is also evident in soccer-related injuries to the groin. Submaximal passing applies high stress on the adductor muscles and pubic symphysis and is therefore likely to be connected to the occurrence of groin injuries. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to compare hip joint kinematics and adductor muscle forces of different adolescent age groups during submaximal soccer passing. Methods Sixty participants, in four groups, younger than 12, 15, 16. and 23 yr (U12, U15, U16, U23), were analyzed. A Footbonaut, equipped with a 3D motion capture system consisting of 16 cameras, was used to capture kinematic data of short passes. Inverse dynamic analysis was performed to calculate muscle forces of 10 passes of each subject. Results The U15 group showed reduced angular velocities. A rise in hip adductor muscle forces was evident from the youngest group up to the oldest groups. The largest increase (49%) was found between U12 and U15. Lower-limb mass was identified as the best predictor for the increasing adductor force. Conclusions The reduced angular velocities of the U15 and the increase in muscle forces between all age groups were attributed to the increasing segment masses and length. This increases the moments of inertia of the leg segments thereby demanding higher forces to accelerate the segments. Most likely, the stress put upon the adductors apophyses increases during adolescence, as tendons are known to adapt slower than muscles, increasing the risk for overuse injuries. Coaches could use lower-limb mass as an indicator for fast increases in the force demand to identify players who would benefit from a reduced training volume.","This paper investigates the impact of age on adductor muscle forces and hip joint kinematics during submaximal soccer passing, highlighting the increased incidence of groin injuries in adolescents. The study finds that younger players exhibit reduced angular velocities, while adductor muscle forces rise significantly from the U12 to U15 age groups, suggesting a greater risk of overuse injuries due to slower tendon adaptation compared to muscle growth."
FUTBOLCULARDA 8 HAFTALIK STATİK GERME ANTRENMANLARININ SIÇRAMA PERFORMANSINA ETKİLERİ,2019-12-30,,,,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eight weeks static stretching traning on jumping. 18 male amateur soccer players (age:21,78±4,25 year; height: 180,11±6,38 cm; weight: 76,19±7,73) were voluntarily participated to study. Subjects were randomly diverted into two groups as stretching (n=10) and control (n=8). Flexibility, horizontal jump distance and vertical jump length were determined using Sit and Reach Test, Standing Long Jump Test and Countermovement Jump technique respectively. Following pre test, stretching group performed static stretching programme three days a week for eight weeks which consisting of ten static stretches that were designed to improve subjects flexibility and include jumping muscles. Following eight weeks static stretching programme, similar measurements were completed. In order to analyze gathering datas, Paired t test was used for determination of intragroups differences and İndependent t test was used for determination of intergroups differences.(p<0.05) There were statistically significant differences between pre and post test flexibiliy measurements (30,60±4,78; 33,90±3,14 cm) and horizontal jump distance (206,38±19,93; 210,25±19,47 cm ) for stretching groups (p<0,05). Yet, there were no statistical differences between groups comparison (p>0,05) To conclude, performed long-term stretching programmes could effect positively on jumping in amateur soccer players. However this study couldnt explore the underlying mechanism of how this effect occured. Future researches about long-term static stretching effects on maximal muscular performances will warranted to illustrate exact physiologicals and metabolics mechanism for those effects.","This study examines the impact of an eight-week static stretching program on the jumping performance of male amateur soccer players. The findings indicate significant improvements in flexibility and horizontal jump distance within the stretching group, though no differences were observed when comparing the stretching group to the control, highlighting a potential positive effect of static stretching on jump performance."

The athlete who use oxygen more economically is more successful. Currently, there is no research on this topic in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani athletes have not been investigated on running economy before, so this will be the first research in this field in the country. By the end of this research more economical position on the pitch and comparison National Football Players with elite athletes has been identified.","This paper investigates the ventilatory responses related to aerobic endurance fitness and running economy among football players, focusing on position-specific differences. It highlights the novelty of studying running economy in Azerbaijani athletes and aims to identify which player positions demonstrate more economical running performance compared to elite counterparts."
Biomechanical Determinants of the Modified and Traditional 505 Change of Direction Speed Test,2019-12-20,,,,"Abstract Dos'Santos, T, McBurnie, A, Thomas, C, Comfort, P, and Jones, PA. Biomechanical determinants of the modified and traditional 505 change of direction speed test. J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1285–1296, 2020—The aim of this study was to investigate the whole-body biomechanical determinants of 180° change of direction (COD) performance. Sixty-one male athletes (age: 20.7 ± 3.8 years, height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m, mass: 74.7 ± 10.0 kg) from multiple sports (soccer, rugby, and cricket) completed 6 trials of the modified and traditional 505 on their right leg, whereby 3D motion and ground reaction force data were collected during the COD. Pearson's and Spearman's correlations were used to explore the relationships between biomechanical variables and COD completion time. Independent t -tests and Hedges' g effect sizes were conducted between faster (top 20) and slower (bottom 20) performers to explore differences in biomechanical variables. Key kinetic and kinematic differences were demonstrated between faster and slower performers with statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.05) and meaningful differences ( g = 0.56–2.70) observed. Faster COD performers displayed greater peak and mean horizontal propulsive forces (PF) in shorter ground contact times, more horizontally orientated peak resultant braking and PFs, greater horizontal to vertical mean and peak braking and PF ratios, greater approach velocities, and displayed greater reductions in velocity over key instances of the COD. In addition, faster performers displayed greater penultimate foot contact (PFC) hip, knee, and ankle dorsi-flexion angles, greater medial trunk lean, and greater internal pelvic and foot rotation. These aforementioned variables were also moderately to very largely ( r or ρ = 0.317–0.795, p ≤ 0.013) associated with faster COD performance. Consequently, practitioners should focus not only on developing their athletes' ability to express force rapidly, but also develop their technical ability to apply force horizontally. In addition, practitioners should consider coaching a 180° turning strategy that emphasizes high PFC triple flexion for center of mass lowering while also encouraging whole-body rotation to effectively align the body toward the exit for faster performance.","This paper investigates the biomechanical factors affecting 180° change of direction (COD) performance in male athletes from various sports, comparing the modified and traditional 505 tests. Key findings indicate that faster performers exhibit superior kinetic and kinematic characteristics, such as increased horizontal propulsive forces and optimized limb positioning, which highlight the importance of both force expression and technical execution in enhancing COD speed."
"Place, Ecological Dynamics and Football",2019-12-17,,,,"In this review article, I will use the phenomenology of place and read it alongside ecological dynamics theories (EDT) in sport. I will show the many congruences between these two areas of research and use place to support, supplement and show the phenomenological and ontological foundations of ecological dynamics analysis in sports. I show that the findings and principles used in ecological dynamics can be better understood through the work of Australian place phenomenologist Jeff Malpas. Through this relationship between phenomenological philosophy and ecological dynamics theory, I hope to establish a stronger connection between these two diverging fields of research (phenomenological ontology and sport science). Throughout this article, I demonstrate that an understanding of place can provide a widened and phenomenological basis for the understanding of EDT of sport including affordances, constraints, expertise and learning. Specifically, I use the first-person perspective of the phenomenology of place to illustrate a perspective that ecological dynamics theories do not have access due to the nature of their method. As a result, this article augments both the philosophy of place and ecological dynamics theories of sport by orientating them to different views on the same phenomena. Place benefits by being practically applied to sport sciences whereas ecological dynamics benefits by unveiling a new phenomenological perspective, description and ontological grounding to their object of study.","This paper reviews the intersection of place phenomenology and ecological dynamics theories (EDT) in sport, specifically football. It argues that understanding place can enhance the application and insights of EDT by providing a phenomenological basis for concepts such as affordances, constraints, expertise, and learning, thereby bridging the gap between phenomenological ontology and sport science."
The effect of sports shoes on flat foot,2019-12-14,,,,"Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effects of participation in sports on the structural deformities of the foot. Methods: A total of 2013 athletes (1301 males, 712 females) who had regularly participated in sports for a minimum of three years were included in the study. Screening of the sole was performed using a podoscope as it is a reliable and practical device. The structure of the sole was evaluated with the highly valid Staheli index. Results: A significant relationship was detected between the ages of the athletes, years in sport, branch of sports variables and the prevalence of flat foot. However, no significant relationship was found between the athletes’ gender and the prevalence of flat foot. Conclusion: It is thought that the training regimes, the floor on which the sports is performed and the shoes used in sports had effects on flat foot deformity. Based on our results, we assert that redesigning the competition shoes and using sports shoes with arch support during warm-ups, running and other sportive and educational drills outside the routine activities of the sports branch may be beneficial for foot health.","This study investigates the influence of sports participation on foot structural deformities, specifically focusing on flat foot prevalence among athletes. It identifies significant correlations between athlete age, duration of sports participation, and their sport type, while suggesting redesigning athletic footwear to include arch support for improved foot health."
"The Physiological, Physical, and Biomechanical Demands of Walking Football: Implications for Exercise Prescription and Future Research in Older Adults",2019-12-11,,,,"The aim of this investigation was to profile the physiological, physical, and biomechanical responses during walking football. A total of 17 male participants (aged 66 ± 6 years) participated. Heart rate; blood lactate; accelerometer variables (biomechanical load [PlayerLoad™], changes of direction); and rating of perceived exertion were measured. Participants mean percentage of maximum heart rate was 76 ± 6% during the sessions, with rating of perceived exertion across all sessions at 13 ± 2. Blood lactate increased by ∼157% from presession (1.24 ± 0.4 mmol/L) to postsession (3.19 ± 1.7 mmol/L; p ≤ .0005). PlayerLoad™ values of 353 ± 67 arbitrary units were observed, as well as ∼100 changes of direction per session. In conclusion, walking football is a moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity. The longitudinal health benefits of walking football remain to be elucidated, particularly on bone health, cardiovascular fitness, and social and mental well-being.","This paper investigates the physiological, physical, and biomechanical responses of older adults participating in walking football, highlighting heart rate, blood lactate levels, and physical exertion metrics.

BDNF Val66Met Positive Players Demonstrate Diffusion Tensor Imaging Consistent With Impaired Myelination Associated With High Levels of Soccer Heading: Indication of a Potential Gene-Environment Interaction Mechanism,2019-12-11,,,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the potential effect modifying role of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on the association of soccer heading with white matter microstructure. We studied 312 players enrolled in the ongoing Einstein Soccer Study, a longitudinal study of amateur soccer player in New York City and surrounding areas. At enrollment and two years later, total heading in the prior 12 months (12-mo.) was estimated using an established self-report instrument and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) logistic regression models were employed to test effect modification by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on the association between 12-mo. heading exposure and DTI. We identified a significant interaction of 12-mo heading*BDNF Val66Met genotype on the presence of low Radial Diffusivity, a DTI marker associated with myelination. Only Met (+) players demonstrated significantly reduced odds of low RD (OR (95 % CI): -2.36 (-3.53, -1.19)) associated with the highest vs. lowest quartile of 12-mo heading exposure. BDNF Val66Met (+) soccer players with long-term exposure to high levels of heading exhibit less low Radial Diffusivity, suggesting impaired re-myelination may be a substrate of the previously reported association between heading and poor functional outcomes in soccer players.","The paper investigates the influence of the BDNF Val66Met genetic polymorphism on the relationship between soccer heading and white matter microstructure in amateur players. Findings indicate that players with the Met(+) genotype exposed to high levels of heading show reduced odds of impaired myelination, suggesting a gene-environment interaction that may contribute to adverse functional outcomes in soccer."

The Effects of Lower-Extremity Plyometric Training on Soccer-Specific Outcomes in Adult Male Soccer Players: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2019-12-05,,,,"Plyometric training is a specific form of strength training that is used to improve the physical performance of athletes. An overview of the effects of plyometric training on soccer-specific outcomes in adult male soccer players is not available yet.To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of plyometric training on soccer-specific outcome measures in adult male soccer players and to identify which programs are most effective.PubMed, Embase/Medline, Cochrane, PEDro, and Scopus were searched. Extensive quality and risk of bias assessments were performed using the Cochrane ROBINS 2.0 for randomized trials. A random effects meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3.Seventeen randomized trials were included in the meta-analysis. The impact of plyometric training on strength, jump height, sprint speed, agility, and endurance was assessed. Only jump height, 20-m sprint speed, and endurance were significantly improved by plyometric training in soccer players. Results of the risk of bias assessment of the included studies resulted in overall scores of some concerns for risk of bias and high risk of bias.This review and meta-analysis showed that plyometric training improved jump height, 20-m sprint speed, and endurance, but not strength, sprint speed over other distances, or agility in male adult soccer players. However, the low quality of the included studies and substantial heterogeneity means that results need to be interpreted with caution. Future high-quality research should indicate whether or not plyometric training can be used to improve soccer-specific outcomes and thereby enhance performance.","This paper systematically reviews and meta-analyzes the effects of lower-extremity plyometric training on soccer-specific outcomes in adult male soccer players. The findings indicate that such training significantly improves jump height, 20-meter sprint speed, and endurance, although the studies included exhibit concerns regarding quality and bias, warranting cautious interpretation of the results."
Workload and Injury in Professional Soccer Players: Role of Injury Tissue Type and Injury Severity,2019-12-04,,,,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of workload prior to injury on injury (tissue type and severity) in professional soccer players. Twenty-eight days of retrospective training data prior to non-contact injuries (n=264) were collated from 192 professional soccer players. Each injury tissue type (muscle, tendon and ligament) and severity (days missed) were categorised by medical staff. Training data were recorded using global positioning system (GPS) devices for total distance (TD), high speed distance (HSD,>5.5 m/s-1), and sprint distance (SPR,>7.0 m/s-1). Accumulated 1, 2, 3, 4-weekly loads and acute:chronic workload ratios (ACWR) (coupled, uncoupled and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) approaches) were calculated. Workload variables and injury tissue type were compared using a one-way ANOVA. The association between workload variables and injury severity were examined using a bivariate correlation. There were no differences in accumulated weekly loads and ACWR calculations between muscle, ligament, and tendon injuries (P>0.05). Correlations between each workload variable and injury severity highlighted no significant associations (P>0.05). The present findings suggest that the ability of accumulated weekly workload or ACWR methods to differentiate between injury type and injury severity are limited using the present variables.","This study investigates the relationship between workload prior to injury and the type and severity of non-contact injuries in professional soccer players, analyzing data from 192 athletes and focusing on different tissue injuries. The findings indicate no significant associations between accumulated weekly workload or acute:chronic workload ratios and injury severity or type, suggesting limitations in using these workload variables to differentiate injury characteristics."
Lower limb strength asymmetry and Functional Movement Screen values in professional soccer players,2019-12-04,,,,"Aim: The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) protocol consists of 7 tests. At higher values ​​mean higher quality of execution. The lower limb functional asymmetry (FA) is monitored to control the athlete's injury risk. This study aims to examine the correlation between the FMS score and strength asymmetry in professional soccer players (PSP). Methods: n=31 PSP (age:22.2±4.6; weight:74.3±10,1kg; height:176.1±8.7cm), n=4 were excluded for joint or muscle injury in the last 18 months. The FMS protocol identifies athletes at risk of injury when the total score is≤14. The Hop Test (HT), Side Hop Test (SH) and Crossover Hop Test (CH) are considered a valid assessment of the single lower limb FA. Results: It revealed a significant inverse correlation between FMS score and HT (r = -0.56, p&lt;0.01), between FMS score and SH asymmetry percentage (r =-0.74, p&lt;0.01) and the CH asymmetry percentage (r=-0.60, p&lt;0.01). Significant correlation were found between HT asymmetry and SH asymmetry (r= -0.54, p&lt;0.01), CH asymmetry (r=-0.59, p&lt;0.01); significant correlation were found between SH asymmetry and CH asymmetry (r= -0.76, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Low scores in the FMS test are correlated with high levels lower limb strength asymmetry in the soccer player; it can be assumed that movement accuracy influences jump performance. In the soccer players, the lower limb strength asymmetries are observed on the jumps performed in different planes and in different tasks.","The paper investigates the relationship between lower limb strength asymmetry and Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores in professional soccer players, aiming to identify risk factors for injury.

Difference in leg asymmetry between female collegiate athletes and recreational athletes during drop vertical jump,2019-12-01,,,,"Abstract Background Neuromuscular imbalance will lead to loading asymmetry in sporting activities. This asymmetry is related to leg dominance, which has been associated with increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Therefore, potential biomechanical differences between legs are important. However, little attention has been paid to the biomechanical details of leg dominance. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the relationship between leg dominance and knee biomechanics in females with different activity level during dynamic athletic tasks. Methods A total of 23 female collegiate (mean age = 19.6 ± 1.4 years, mean body mass index = 21.5 ± 0.9) and 19 recreational athletes (mean age = 20.7 ± 1.1 years, mean body mass index = 20.5 ± 1.7) were enrolled. Tegner activity scores of the collegiate and recreational athletes were 9 and 7, respectively. Knee kinematic and kinetic asymmetries between the dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NDL) legs during the landing phase of drop vertical jump (DVJ) were assessed using three-dimensional motion analysis in collegiate and recreational athletes separately. Statistical comparison was done using two-tailed paired t test between DL and NDL in each athlete. Results The peak knee abduction angle was significantly larger on the DL than on the NDL in collegiate athletes. Knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC), peak knee abduction angle, knee internal rotation angle at IC, and peak knee internal rotation angle were significantly larger on the NDL than on the DL in recreational athletes. Moreover, peak knee abduction moment within 40 ms from IC was larger on the NDL than on the DL in recreational athletes, while the moment was not significantly different in collegiate athletes. Conclusions From the present study, the relationship between leg dominance and knee biomechanics was totally different in females with different activity level. Specifically, asymmetry of the knee abduction angle between limbs was opposite between female recreational and collegiate athletes. According to previous literatures, abduction and internal rotation angles as well as abduction moment were key issues for mechanism of non-contact ACL injury. Therefore, the NDL in female recreational athletes was associated with increased risk of ACL injury.","This study investigates the relationship between leg dominance and knee biomechanics in female collegiate and recreational athletes during a drop vertical jump. Key findings reveal significant differences in knee abduction angles and moments between dominant and non-dominant legs, indicating that knee biomechanical asymmetries vary based on the athlete's activity level, potentially influencing ACL injury risk."
Percutaneous needle electrolysis and exercise reduce the time for return to competition after an injury to the hamstrings: Two cases in professional football players,2019-12-01,,,,"Abstract Background and Aims Percutaneous needle electrolysis has shown to be effective for the treatment of chronic tendinopathies, however, the scientific evidence available regarding acute muscle lesions is scarce. Lesions to the hamstrings caused by indirect mechanisms represent the most common muscle lesion in football (its incidence increases each year) with a high rate of recurrence. The aim was to evaluate whether the application of percutaneous needle electrolysis and a program of functional exercise decreases the times for return to competition after an injury to the hamstrings in athletes, and to compare performance data of subjects during competition before and after the injury. Methods A case series. Two professional football players, belonging to a first league team in Spain with a grade 2 lesion in the semitendinosus muscle on the proximal level. The affected muscle structure was assessed using ultrasound (Logiq GE E9, probe ML6–12) and functionality was evaluated based on data of the Global Positioning System (GPS), comparing the data obtained during the process of re-adaptation with data prior to the lesion. Percutaneous needle electrolysis was performed under ultrasound guidance at 48 hours after the injury following the protocol defined by Valera &amp; Minaya (2:3:5). The indoor recovery of players began 24 hours after the percutaneous needle electrolysis. Initially, the exercise program included activities of mobility and controlled loading. Thereafter, the players completed their readaptation program in the training field with exercises of progressive complexity and intensity (biomechanical patterns and neuromuscular control of the central zone and the lower limbs, sprint). Results Player A returned to competition in 16 days, player B returned in 14 days. No adverse effects were identified during or after the percutaneous needle electrolysis technique. The players only missed one competition game and the process of readaptation allowed them to return to play registering parameters which were similar to the values prior to the lesion, and maintaining the performance during the four matches following the intervention protocol. The players were followed up to eight months after the injury and neither player suffered a relapse during this period, which indicates the complete recovery of the injured muscle both on a structural and functional level. Conclusions The combined treatment using percutaneous needle electrolysis and a functional exercise program reduces the time for return to competition after a grade 2 muscle lesion in the hamstrings, with a level of performance that is similar to prior to the lesion, without relapses, in an 8 month follow up period. The criteria we use to determine when a player can return to train with the team and compete after an acute muscle injury are: the time that has passed since the lesion, structural changes and the ability to perform tasks.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of percutaneous needle electrolysis combined with a functional exercise program in reducing the return-to-competition time for professional football players suffering from grade 2 hamstring injuries. The results indicate that this combined treatment approach allowed players to return to competition within 14 to 16 days, with performance levels comparable to pre-injury status and no relapses over an eight-month follow-up period."
Statistical Parametric Mapping을 이용한 시상면에서의 양발 착지와 외발 착지의 전략 차이,2019-12-01,,,,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate differences of shock attenuation strategies between double-leg and single-leg landing on sagittal plane using statistical parametric mapping.
Method: Nine healthy female professional soccer players (age: 24.0±2.5 yrs, height: 164.9±3.3 cm, weight: 55.7±6.6 kg, career: 11.2±1.4 yrs) were participated in this study. The subjects performed 10 times of double-leg and single-leg landing from the box of 30 cm height onto force plates respectively. The ground reaction force, angle, moment, angular velocity, and power of the ankle, knee, and hip joint on sagittal plane was calculated from initial contact to maximum knee flexion during landing phase. Statistical parametric mapping was used to compare the biomechanical variables of double-leg and single-leg landing of the dominant leg throughout the landing phase. Each mean difference of variables was analyzed using a paired t-test and alpha level was set to 0.05.
Results: For the biomechanical variables, significantly increased vertical ground reaction force, plantarflexion moment of the ankle joint, negative ankle joint power and extension moment of the hip joint were found in single-leg landing compared to double-leg landing (p<.05). In addition, the flexion angle and angular velocity of the knee and hip joint in double-leg landing were observed significantly greater than single-leg landing, respectively (p<.05).
Conclusion: These findings suggested that negative joint power and plantarflexion moment of the ankle joint can contribute to shock absorption during single-leg landing and may be the factors for preventing the musculoskeletal injuries of the lower extremity by an external force.","This study investigates the differences in shock attenuation strategies between double-leg and single-leg landings in the sagittal plane using statistical parametric mapping. Key findings indicate that single-leg landings result in increased vertical ground reaction force and specific joint moments compared to double-leg landings, highlighting their potential implications for preventing lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries."
Short-Term Repeated-Sprint Training (Straight Sprint vs. Changes of Direction) in Soccer Players,2019-11-30,,,,"Repeated-sprint training (RST) is considered a critical training method in team sports. It is well known that RST effects may depend on several variables such as the duration of the protocol and repeated-sprint methodology. Few studies have evaluated very short-term protocols and compared different RST modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 2 week RST including straight sprints or changes of direction (CODs) on physical performance in a sample of soccer players. This study used a randomised pre-post parallel group trial design. The participants were assigned to either an RST group using straight sprints (RST-SS = 18 players) or an RST group using CODs (RST-COD = 18 players). The protocols were: 3 sets of 7 x 30 m sprints for the RST-SS and 7 x 20 + 20 m (one COD of 180°) for the RST-COD, with 20 s and 4 min recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. The following evaluations were performed: 10 and 20 m sprint, agility test, repeated sprint test (RSTbest and RSTmean), and Yo-Yo Recovery Level 1. After the training period, the RST-SS did not report any performance variation, while the RST-COD showed improvements in the 10 m sprint and RSTbest (effect size = 0.70 and 0.65, respectively). The between-group analysis did not report any statistical difference between the RST-SS and the RST-COD. In conclusion, this study did not support the utilisation of a very short-term RST protocol with soccer players, however, the RST-COD presented some additional benefits in sprint performance compared to the RST-SS.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of two different short-term repeated-sprint training protocols—straight sprints and changes of direction (COD)—on physical performance in soccer players. It concludes that while the straight sprint protocol did not lead to performance changes, the COD training resulted in improvements in 10 m sprint and repeated sprint test outcomes."
Aerobic and anaerobic physical capacities per station based on field tests of elite Melano-African footballers in hot and humid environments,2019-11-30,,,,"Anthropometric parameters and physical abilities are taken into account in the footballer's position on the field, for the achievement of good performance. The objective of this study was to assess the anthropometric parameters and physical capacities of Congolese elite footballers by position. Twenty-two (22) footballers aged 27.00 ± 4.58 years to 31.00 ± 1.3 years participated in the study. Anthropometric parameters (weight, height, calf and thigh circumference, lean mass and percentage fat mass) and physical capacities (maximum oxygen consumption, reaction rate and vertical expansion) were measured per shift during the championship. The results showed a significant difference (p ˂ 0.05), anthropometric parameters and physical capacities according to the position held. A positive correlation was observed between the two variables. In conclusion, Congolese footballers have a morphology and physique that differ by position in response to the practice of elite football. Football managers and coaches should place the training material at the footballer's development centre and integrate its evaluation into the annual activity planning.","The paper assesses the anthropometric parameters and physical capacities of Congolese elite footballers based on their playing positions. It highlights significant differences in these attributes, suggesting that training and evaluation should be tailored according to specific player positions to enhance performance."
Kinetic and Kinematic Analysis of the Phases of Kicking during Accurate and Maximal Effort Conditions in Female Soccer Players,2019-11-26,,,,"Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world and the substantial increase in participation over the last decade adds significance to understanding kicking mechanics as kicking is a key skill during a game. The biomechanics of soccer kicking have been widely investigated and there is a conventional belief that a tradeoff exists between speed and accuracy during kicking performance. However, the kinetics and kinematics of the kicking leg during the approach to the ball remain unclear and whether or not instep soccer kicks can be performed without a speed-accuracy tradeoff. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinetic and kinematic differences between accurate and maximal effort soccer kicking in female soccer players.
Twenty female soccer players from the college club or varsity level performed three trials of an accurate kick and three trials of a maximal effort kick. Bilateral hip, knee and ankle joint angles and velocities and ground reaction forces (GRFs) of the kicking leg (KL) and plant leg (PL) were calculated. In addition, correlation coefficients were calculated between variables in each condition. During maximal effort kicking, players significantly increased peak hip, knee and ankle angles (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 0.034), angular velocities (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 0.004), and foot velocity (p = 0.000) in the KL. This was likely the result of the significant increase in peak horizontal GRF in the KL (p = 0.000) and PL (p = 0.000). Peak horizontal GRF in the KL had the strongest correlation with foot linear velocity in accurate kicking (R = 0.77*) compared to in maximal effort kicking (R = 60*), and had a stronger influence on foot velocity compared to peak horizontal GRF in the PL in both accurate (R = 0.31*) and maximal effort (0.23) conditions. This suggests that peak horizontal GRF in the KL, rather than in the PL, plays a more important role in kick velocity, especially when kicking accurately. Results indicate that increasing horizontal GRF in the KL in both conditions is key to improving velocity since that variable is highly correlated in each condition. In addition, less variation of horizontal GRFs in the KL in maximal effort kicking indicate faster kicks result in more consistent foot velocities and suggests that players reduce variability as they approach maximum velocity. These results provide evidence that accuracy may not have to be sacrificed when kicks are faster if players practice accurate performances when kicking with maximum velocity due to the less variability in the initial programmed pattern of movement during fast performances. Coaches and trainers may utilize these results to develop training protocols that involve increasing GRFs of the KL and practicing kicks that are both accurate and fast to increase overall accuracy during maximum velocity instep soccer kicks.","This study investigates the kinetic and kinematic differences between accurate and maximal effort kicking in female soccer players, emphasizing the role of ground reaction forces in kick performance. Results indicate that improving horizontal ground reaction forces in the kicking leg can enhance kick velocity without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting potential training applications for coaches."
Football as Medicine,2019-11-22,,,,"It is beyond dispute that physical activity is good for us, but what are the benefits, challenges and impacts of sport on health? This is the first book to focus on football in the context of health from individual, public and population-level perspectives. Football as Medicine examines the effects of football training on the three main types of fitness (cardiovascular, metabolic and musculoskeletal) and on specific target populations (for example, children, type 2 diabetes patients, cancer patients, people with mental health conditions, the socially deprived and older people). It discusses the significance of football for public health and assesses the efficacy of football interventions by clubs and community sport development programs. With its multi-disciplinary approach, this is a valuable resource for students, researchers and practitioners working in physical activity and health, public health, health promotion and medicine, as well as football and sport business management, sport and exercise science, and the sociology of sport.","This paper explores the health benefits, challenges, and impacts of football as a form of physical activity. It examines how football training affects cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal fitness across various populations, highlighting its significance for public health and the effectiveness of community-based football interventions."
Short‐term effects of differential learning and contextual interference in a goalkeeper‐like task: Visuomotor response time and motor control,2019-11-22,,,,"Abstract In this experiment, we compared changes in visuomotor performance and motor control after a single session of differential learning (DL) and contextual interference (CI) in a reaching task to mimic goalkeeping. Subjects (n DL = n CI = 16) stood in front of a wall with six LED‐light targets that flashed on in a random order and subjects had to move their hand in front of it as fast as possible in order to extinguish the target. After the pre‐test subjects followed a DL or CI training session, followed immediately by a post‐test, followed by one hour of rest and a retention test. Performance and motor control were measured respectively by visuomotor response time (VMRT) and an Index of Motor Abundance (IMA; reflecting the strength of movement synergies) calculated with Uncontrolled Manifold analysis. A mixed‐effects Bayesian ANOVA model was used to evaluate differences in changes in both parameters between both training groups. Averaged over the six targets, the decrease in VMRT was stronger for DL than CI at the post‐test (interference effect) but not at retention. The IMA was on average increased at post‐ and retention test in both groups, indicating stronger synergies between the degrees‐of‐freedom. While the ANOVA for IMA was not conclusive, the changes were likely not different between both learning methods. Thus, while an interference effect was found for CI but not DL in terms of performance on the task, no such effect was observed on the behavioural level in terms of the strength of movement synergies.","This paper examines the short-term effects of differential learning and contextual interference on visuomotor performance and motor control in a goalkeeping-related task. The study found that differential learning resulted in a greater decrease in visuomotor response time compared to contextual interference post-training, although both methods improved the strength of movement synergies similarly over time."
Protracted Cardiovascular Impairments After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Critically Appraised Topic,2019-11-20,,,,"Clinical Scenario : Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a devastating knee injury with negative long-term consequences, such as early-onset knee osteoarthritis, biomechanical compensations, and reduced physical activity. Significant reduction in physical activity is a powerful indicator of cardiovascular (CV) disease; therefore, those with a history of ACL injury may be at increased risk for CV disease compared with noninjured individuals. Focused Clinical Question : Do individuals with a history of ACL injury demonstrate negative CV changes compared with those without a history of ACL injury? Summary of Key Findings : Three articles met the inclusion criteria and investigated CV changes after ACL injury. Both cross-sectional studies compared participants with ACL injury with matched controls. Bell et al compared time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity and step count, whereas Almeida et al compared maximum rate of oxygen consumption, ventilatory thresholds, isokinetic quadriceps strength, and body composition. Collectively, both quantitative studies found that individuals with a history of ACL injury had less efficient CV systems compared with matched controls and/or preoperative data. Finally, a qualitative study of 3506 retired National Football League athletes showed an increased rate of arthritis and knee replacement surgery after an ACL injury when compared with other retired National Football League members, in addition to a &gt;50% increased rate of myocardial infarction. Clinical Bottom Line : A history of ACL injury is a source of impaired physical activity. Preliminary data indicate that these physical activity limitations negatively impair the CV system, and individuals with a history of ACL injury demonstrate lower maximum oxygen consumption, self-reported disability, and daily step count compared with noninjured peers. These complications support the need for greater emphasis on CV wellness. Strength of Recommendation : Consistent findings from 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 survey study suggest level IIB evidence to support that ACL injury is associated with negative CV health.","The paper investigates the long-term cardiovascular (CV) impairments associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Key findings indicate that individuals with a history of ACL injury exhibit reduced physical activity, impaired CV systems, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases compared to noninjured individuals and highlight the need for enhanced focus on cardiovascular health in this population."
CORR Insights®: Women Are at Higher Risk for Concussions Due to Ball or Equipment Contact in Soccer and Lacrosse,2019-11-19,,,,"Where Are We Now? The general public’s awareness of concussive injuries in sports may be at an all-time high. Recent coverage in the lay media [8, 13] has emphasized the risks and long-term sequelae of sports-related concussion in athletes. It is well-known that contact sports, like American football, with its frequent collisions between players, are associated with the highest incidence of concussive injuries [4, 5, 9]. One study found that in a convenience sample of 202 deceased players of American football from a brain donation program, the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players across all levels of play (87%), including 110 of 111 former National Football League players (99%) [10]. Although women athletes are less likely to incur a head injury caused by contact with another player than are men athletes, women athletes are more likely to incur a concussive injury from a playing surface or an apparatus than men [1]. In the current meta-analysis, Ling and colleagues [7] found that women athletes have a lower risk of player-contact-induced concussions in lacrosse, basketball, ice hockey, and soccer than do men, but are more likely to experience concussions because of ball or equipment contact in lacrosse and soccer compared to men playing those same sports. These results held true in spite of rules differences between the men’s and women’s lacrosse games. Injury is a part of sport, and participating athletes and the supporting public are willing to accept nominal risk. But the prospect of late dementia, accelerated by repetitive microtrauma to the brain, looms over all participants in contact sports, as well as the sports themselves. Where Do We Need To Go? The current study helps readers better understand the different ways in which men and women athletes get concussions across different sports. The key question is how do we translate the information provided by Ling and colleagues [7] into actual safety practices for athletes? Rules changes, equipment modification, or additional training could potentially curb some repetitive hits to the head. In 2015, the United States Soccer Federation announced the U.S. Soccer Concussion Initiative 2016, which bans heading for children 10 years of age or younger. This initiative limits headers for children aged 11 to 13 to 30 minutes per week [3]. Yet, the case can be made that rules changes and equipment modifications may not be enough to solve the problem in some sports [6]. Additionally, development costs will likely be high and concerns about product liability always arise. Future studies that examine the effects of equipment and player surfaces on injuries can help us to determine if these changes can actually reduce the rate and severity of injury and whether they are likely to be cost effective. Advances in materials science, helmet design and use of protective devices and padding are likely to incrementally improve the safety of athletes involved in rough play. But in sports in which the risk of concussion is high, it may not be ethical or desirable to experiment on the brains of another generation of young players knowing what we know now [6]. Educational programs exist for young athletes and common sense training for coaches and athletes could be effective as ACL injury prevention has gained some traction [2, 12, 15]. How Do We Get There? While randomized, multi-center studies with a high number of patients often are a mainstay of study, these can be hard to do, costly, and time consuming. It is likely that information gleaned from databases such as those maintained by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Athletic Trainers’ Association [11] will be helpful. Ongoing study of the epidemiology of concussive injury will be needed. Biomechanical studies of protective equipment and play surfaces will be helpful. Research into the effects of concussion-prevention training could be promising [14]. The time is right for studies to examine injury rates for women and girl athletes in soccer and lacrosse with and without concussion-prevention training.","This paper analyzes the higher risk of concussive injuries among women athletes in soccer and lacrosse, primarily due to ball or equipment contact rather than player contact. It emphasizes the need for changes in safety practices, including rules modifications, equipment improvements, and concussion-prevention training, while advocating for further research on injury rates and protective measures in these sports."
Effects of Two Competitive Soccer Matches on Landing Biomechanics in Female Division I Soccer Players,2019-11-14,,,,"Fatigue has been proposed to increase the risk of knee injury. This study tracked countermovement jump, knee isometric strength, and kinetics and kinematics in 8 female soccer players (experimental group) during an anticipated sidestep maneuver before and after two matches played over a 43-h period. Time points were: Before and after match 1 (T0 and T1), 12 h after the first match (T2), and immediately after the second match (T3). A control group participated only in practice sessions. Isometric knee extension strength decreased by 14.8% at T2 (p = 0.003), but knee flexion was not affected until T3, declining by 12.6% (p = 0.018). During the sidestep maneuver, knee joint degrees of flexion at initial contact was increased by 17.1% at T3, but maximum knee and hip angle at initial contact were unchanged. Peak resultant ground reaction force (GRF) increased by 12.6% (p = 0.047) at T3 (3.03 xBW) from 2.69 xBW at T0, while posterior GRF was significantly higher than T0 at all three subsequent time points (T1 = 0.82 ± 0.23 xBW, T2 = 0.87 ± 0.22 xBW, T3 = 0.89 ± 0.22 xBW). Anterior tibial shear force increased significantly (p = 0.020) at T3 (1.24 ± 0.12 xBW) compared to T1 (1.15 ± 0.13 xBW), an 8.8% increase. Lateral tibial shear force was significantly higher at both T1 (0.95 ± 0.20 xBW) and T3 (1.15 ± 0.38 xBW) compared to T0 (0.67 ± 0.25 xBW). These findings suggest that participation in a soccer match has significant effects on both physical performance parameters and kinetics/kinematics during a sidestep cut, but these can be more pronounced after a second match with short rest.","This paper investigates the effects of fatigue from two competitive soccer matches on the landing biomechanics of female Division I soccer players. Key findings indicate a significant decrease in knee extension strength and alterations in knee joint angles and ground reaction forces during a sidestep maneuver, highlighting how match fatigue can impact performance and increase injury risk."
Footwear insoles with higher frictional properties enhance performance by reducing in-shoe sliding during rapid changes of direction,2019-11-13,,,,"A novel 3D motion capture analysis assessed the efficacy of insoles in maintaining the foot position on the midsole platform inside the shoe during rapid change of direction manoeuvres used in team sports. An insole (TI) with increased static (35%) and dynamic (49%) coefficient of friction compared to a regular insole (SI) was tested. Change of direction performance was faster (p < .001) and perceived to be faster (p < .001) in TI compared to SI. Participants utilised greater coefficient of friction in TI compared to SI during a complete turn, but not during a 20 degree side-cut. In-shoe foot sliding reduced across the forefoot and midfoot during the braking phase of the turn and in the rearfoot during the side-cut in TI. Greater in-shoe foot sliding occurred in the turn than the side-cut across all foot regions. Results provide guidance for athletic footwear design to help limit in-shoe foot sliding and improve change of direction performance.",This paper investigates the impact of footwear insoles on foot stability during rapid directional changes in team sports. The study found that insoles with higher friction properties significantly reduced in-shoe foot sliding and improved change of direction performance compared to standard insoles.
Does the psychological profile influence the position of promising young futsal players?,2019-11-12,,,,"Stress control as well as other psychological characteristics influence sports performance (SP) and could be relevant according to the playing position in team sports, such as the futsal where players have different specific functions within the team. The aim of this study was to analyze the psychological characteristics and profile related to SP of top-level young futsal players, according to the offensive or defensive role. A total of one hundred sixty-seven young promises futsal players participated in this study (84 U16 and 83 U19) and have been chosen to play Championship of Spain Selections. The Psychological Characteristics related to SP for soccer players Questionnaire was used, and one-way ANOVA test was performed based on the playing position (goalkeeper, defender and defender-wing, wing and wing-defender, pivot and wing-pivot, and universal). Results showed that goalkeepers had the best psychological profile and characteristics related to SP. Pivots and wing-pivots had less self-confidence, and universals players, less stress control in relation to the rest of the playing positions (p < 0.05). The main findings revealed that the psychological characteristics and profile related to SP in young promises futsal players are different according to the playing position, and this study suggest the inclusion of psychological-training programs in order to improve the psychological abilities of players, especially for players with offensive role who seek to score goals.","This paper examines the influence of psychological characteristics on the sports performance of young futsal players, analyzing differences based on playing position. The study finds that goalkeepers possess the strongest psychological profile, while players in offensive roles, such as pivots and wing-pivots, demonstrate lower self-confidence and stress control, suggesting a need for targeted psychological training programs."
ANALYSIS OF Y BALANCE TEST AND DORSIFLEXION LUNGE TEST IN PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR SOCCER PLAYERS,2019-11-09,,,,"ABSTRACT Introduction The ankle has the highest incidence of soccer injuries (17 to 20% of injuries), which can cause personal and professional losses for the athlete. Ankle stability is due to a number of mechanisms, such as muscle control between agonists and antagonists, proprioception, balance, and muscle strength. If there are changes in any of these mechanisms, there is an increased risk of ankle injuries. Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze the ankle function of amateur and professional soccer players in the preseason, using Y Balance Test (YBT) and Dorsiflexion Lunge Test (DLT), observing possible functional deficits in this sample, and subsequently analyzing the relationship of results between the functional tests in this population. Methods A total of 107 soccer players were assessed, of whom 36 were amateur and 71 professional athletes. The volunteers initially underwent history taking, followed by a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle then the YBT and DLT functional tests. Results There was no significant difference in the DLT between dominant and non-dominant limbs in amateur and professional athletes. There was also no significant difference in the YBT between dominant and non-dominant limbs of amateur athletes, but there was a significant difference between dominant and non-dominant limbs in professional athletes. There was no correlation between the tests when the dominant and non-dominant limbs of the sample were analyzed. Conclusion The weak relationship between the functional tests indicates that both tests are recommended for athletes in clinical practice, since they serve as tools to assess different functional deficits. Level of Evidence III - Case-control study.","The paper examines the ankle function of amateur and professional soccer players through the Y Balance Test and Dorsiflexion Lunge Test to identify functional deficits in the preseason. It finds no significant differences in test results between limb dominance in amateurs and highlights a distinction in professionals, suggesting both tests can effectively assess varying functional deficits in clinical practice."
Injury Prevention in Youth Football Players : Training Effects and Programme Implementation,2019-11-08,,,,"Background With 17-35% of all 14-year-olds in Sweden being active in football, injuries do occur, most frequently during match play.Based on knowledge of injury mechanisms and risk factors, different injury prevention exercise programmes (IPEPs) have been developed.In this thesis, the Swedish IPEP Knee Control was used as a model for injury preventive training. AimThe overall aim of this thesis was to improve our understanding of the effects of the Knee Control injury prevention exercise programme on sports performance and jump-landing technique, as well as exploring programme implementation and coach experiences of using the programme in youth football.Methods Studies I and IV were cluster-randomised trials focusing on the performance effects of Knee Control.Study I included four teams with 41 female youth football players (mean age 14).The intervention group used Knee Control twice weekly for 11 weeks, whereas the control group teams did their usual training.Knee Control includes six different exercises at four levels of difficulty and with partner exercises and is meant to be used during warm-up at every training session.Performance was tested using a battery of balance, agility, jump and sprint tests at baseline and follow-up at an indoor venue.Study IV had a similar set-up but included two different interventions: Knee Control and a new, further-developed version of the programme, Knee Control+, which were studied during an eight-week intervention involving eight youth football teams, four male, four female (mean age 14), with 77 players.Similar, but not identical, performance tests were used in Study IV, along with drop vertical jumps and tuck jump assessment to assess jump-landing technique.Studies II and III focused on the implementation context.Study II was questionnaire based, using the RE-AIM framework covering the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of Knee Control.Coaches for female youth teams (n=352), one representative of the national football association and representatives of eight district football associations responded to web-based questionnaires.Data collection was performed two years after the nation-wide implementation of Knee Control started.Study III was a qualitative study that followed up on the results of Study II.Interviews were conducted with 20 coaches for female football teams and analysed using qualitative content analysis.The interviews focused on factors that affected the adoption and use of Knee Control.All 20 coaches had experience of Knee Control.","This thesis investigates the effects of the Knee Control injury prevention exercise program on sports performance and jump-landing techniques in youth football players, while also examining the implementation and coach experiences associated with the program.

A novel test reliably captures hip and knee kinematics and kinetics during unanticipated/anticipated diagonal hops in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,2019-11-02,,,,"Unanticipated land-and-cut maneuvers might emulate lower limb mechanics associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Reliability studies on landing mechanics of such maneuvers are however lacking. This study investigated feasibility and within-session reliability of landing mechanics of a novel one-leg double-hop test, mimicking a land-and-cut maneuver, in individuals with ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Our test comprised a forward hop followed by a diagonal hop in either of two directions (medial/lateral) under anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Twenty individuals with a unilateral ACLR (aged 24.2 ± 4.2 years, 0.7-10.8 years post-surgery) performed three successful hops/direction per leg. We determined reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and agreement (standard error of measurement [SEM]) of 3-dimensional hip and knee angles and moments during the deceleration phase of the land-and-cut maneuver (vulnerable for non-contact ACL injuries). Mean success rate for unanticipated hops was 71-77% and for anticipated hops 91-95%. Both limbs demonstrated moderate-excellent reliability (ICC 95% confidence intervals: 0.50-0.99) for almost all hip and knee peak angles and moments in all planes and conditions, with a few exceptions: poor-good reliability for hip and knee frontal and/or transverse plane variables, especially for lateral diagonal hops. The SEMs were ≤5° and ≤0.23 N·m/kg·m for most peak angles and moments, respectively. Our test seems feasible and showed satisfactory reliability for most hip and knee angles and moments; however, low knee abduction and internal rotation angles and moments, and moderate reliability of these moments deserve consideration. The test appears to challenge dynamic knee control and may prove valuable in evaluation during knee rehabilitation.","This paper investigates the reliability of a novel one-leg double-hop test designed to mimic land-and-cut maneuvers in individuals who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The study found that while the test demonstrated satisfactory reliability for most hip and knee kinematics, there were notable exceptions in certain conditions that warrant further examination for application in knee rehabilitation."
Anterior cruciate ligament injury risk factors in football,2019-11-01,,,,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion represents one of the most dramatic injuries in a football (soccer) player's career. There are many injury risk factors related to intrinsic (non-modifiable) and/or extrinsic (modifiable) factors of ACL injury.Research of the studies was conducted until September 2018 without publication data limitation or language restriction on the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, ISI, EXCERPTA.To date, evidence from the literature suggests that the risk of ACL injury is multifactorial and involves biomechanical, anatomical, hormonal, and neuromuscular factors. Despite this relative complexity, the mechanisms of injury are well known and rationally classified into two categories: mechanisms of injury based on contact or on non-contact with another player, with the non-contact injury mechanisms clearly prevailing over the mechanisms of contact injury. One of the most frequent biomechanical risk factors, associated with ACL non-contact injury, is represented by the valgus knee in the pivoting and cutting movements and in the landing phase after jumping. Gender-related risk factors show female populations to have a higher predisposition to ACL injury than males However, there are still some theoretical and practical aspects that need further investigation such as; genetic risks together with the role of estrogen and progesterone receptors in female populations, and the in-vivo interaction shoe-playing surface. In particular, the genetic risk factors of ACL lesion seem to be an interesting and promising field of investigation, where considerable progress has still to be made.This narrative review provides an insight into the risk factors of ACL injury that could be used by practitioners for preventing injury in football (soccer).","This paper reviews the multifactorial risk factors associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in football, emphasizing both intrinsic (anatomical, hormonal) and extrinsic (biomechanical, neuromuscular) factors. It highlights the predominance of non-contact injury mechanisms and discusses the increased susceptibility of females to ACL injuries, while suggesting the need for further research into genetic risks and the interactions between playing surfaces and footwear."
The use of adaptive neuro-stimulation for rebalancing posture and muscular tone in a soccer team,2019-11-01,,,,"Posture and somatic structure could positively influence athletic gestures for their biomechanical implications. Working on neuromuscular activity, offers the possibility of intervention on postural control. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the possibility of interacting with the human body system through the spinal reflex pathway, starting from the stimulation of cutaneous receptors.Twenty soccer players were recruited: all were male aged 25.5±10.6 years. Patients were divided using a single-blind criterion into two groups, each containing ten subjects. The experimental group was treated with 2 pre-set programs 4 times a week with an adaptive neuro-stimulation (ANS) able to interact with cutaneous receptors through an ENF Physio® device with a range of electrical frequency of about 15-350 Hz; the placebo-controlled group received the treatment with the device switched off. Patients performed a myometric evaluation with the MyotonPRO® system and a postural one with the Rarog software at T0 before the treatment and at T1 after the four-week treatment.After our intervention, we identified an improvement in muscular tone, in particular in the hamstring muscles (17.69%, right P<0.01 / left P<0.05) and a rebalancing of the principal bone points in the postural system (shoulder 71%, P<0.05, hips 65.6%, P=0.056, sagittal AP and frontal LL center of gravity, respectively 40%, P<0.05 and 52.7%, P=0.01).In conclusion, we could hypothesize the usefulness of an ANS to act on these parameters. ANS could be used not only for treatment of injuries but also in the field of prevention.","This paper investigates the effects of adaptive neuro-stimulation (ANS) on postural control and muscular tone in a soccer team.

Developing Coordination As A Determinant Factor Of Proprioception In Football,2019-10-30,,,,"The aim of the research is to present coordination as the main factor of human proprioception. In this idea, coordination is addressed in the football game of children aged 10-12 through specific tests. Experimental pedagogy took place within a sports club from Braşov city to the age group of 10-12 years, practicing the football game. Through the three tests specifically used in the research, a correlation between football co-ordination (component of proprioception) and the specific football-specific coordination skill (skill) was attempted. The pedagogical experiment included two initial and final tests, through which the subjects were evaluated at three specific control samples adapted to their age.

Changes in sprint performance and sagittal plane kinematics after heavy resisted sprint training in professional soccer players,2019-10-29,,,,"Sprint performance is an essential skill to target within soccer. However, time-consuming intervention models could be easily rejected by coaches. Therefore, alternative and efficient field training options are warranted. One such method could be heavy resisted sprint training. However, it is unknown whether such overload will be efficient in assisting increases in sprint performance in a professional setting, and whether violating kinematic specificity via heavy loading will lead to changes in unloaded sprinting kinematics. Thus, we investigated whether heavy resisted training affects sprint performance and sagittal plane kinematics. Training-induced changes in sprint FV-profiles were computed before and after the 9-week, 2 sessions x week protocol. Out of the two recruited teams (N = 32, age: 24.1 ± 5.0 years: height: 180 ± 10 cm; body-mass: 76.7 ± 7.7 kg), one was used as a control group continuing training as normal (CON, N = 13), while the experimental team was divided into two subgroups based on their initial sprint performance: 1) Heavy sled training with the 60% velocity drop (N = 10) and 2) 50% velocity drop load (N = 9). Both experimental groups improved significantly all 0-30-m split times (p &amp;lt; 0.05, d = -0.62 – -1.25), with post-hoc showing HS50% improving significantly compared to CON in 0-10-m split (d = 1.03) and Pmax (d = 1.16). No differences in sprinting kinematics were observed. With appropriate coaching, heavy sled training could be a pragmatic option to assist improvements in sprint performance without adverse changes in sprinting kinematics in professional soccer players.","This paper investigates the effects of heavy resisted sprint training on sprint performance and sagittal plane kinematics in professional soccer players.

Development of a Concussion Risk Function for a Youth Population Using Head Linear and Rotational Acceleration,2019-10-28,,,,"Physical differences between youth and adults, which include incomplete myelination, limited neck muscle development, and a higher head-body ratio in the youth population, likely contribute towards the increased susceptibility of youth to concussion. Previous research efforts have considered the biomechanics of concussion for adult populations, but these known age-related differences highlight the necessity of quantifying the risk of concussion for a youth population. This study adapted the previously developed Generalized Acceleration Model for Brian Injury Threshold (GAMBIT) that combines linear and rotational head acceleration to model the risk of concussion for a youth population with the Generalized Acceleration Model for Concussion in Youth (GAM-CY). Survival analysis was used in conjunction with head impact data collected during participation in youth football to model risk between individuals who sustained medically-diagnosed concussions (n = 15). Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated for peak linear acceleration, peak rotational acceleration, and GAM-CY, all of which were observed to be better injury predictors than random guessing. GAM-CY was associated with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.95) when all head impacts experienced by the concussed players were considered. Concussion tolerance was observed to be lower for youth athletes, with average peak linear head acceleration of 62.4 ± 29.7 g compared to 102.5 ± 32.7 g for adults and average peak rotational head acceleration of 2609 ± 1591 rad/s2 compared to 4412 ± 2326 rad/s2. These data provide further evidence of age-related differences in concussion tolerance and may be used for the development of youth-specific protective designs.","This paper explores the heightened susceptibility of youth to concussions due to physical differences compared to adults and aims to quantify concussion risk using a new model, the Generalized Acceleration Model for Concussion in Youth (GAM-CY). It employs survival analysis of head impact data from youth football players to demonstrate that GAM-CY effectively predicts concussion risk, highlighting significantly lower concussion thresholds for youth compared to adult athletes."

A total of 20 elite male collegiate soccer players (mean age, 19.6±0.7 years; height, 173.4±4.4 cm; body weight, 66.9±7.3 kg; and body mass index, 22.0±2.0 kg/m2) participated in the present study. The subjects were divided into two groups: the high FMS (FMS total score ≥14 points, n=10) and low FMS (FMS total score <14 points, n=10). All participants completed 10-m and 30-m sprint tests, the arrowhead agility test (right and left), and a coordination test. The statistical methods used to verify the study results were the independent sample t-test and Kendall's Tau b correlation test. There were significant differences between the high and low FMS groups in the 10-m (P=0.014) and 30-m sprint (P=0.002) and arrowhead agility tests (right, P=0.039). Conversely, there were no significant differences in the arrowhead agility (left) and coordination tests between the two groups (P>0.05). Moreover, the FMS total score was found to have significant negative correlations with the 10-m sprint (r=-0.444, P=0.017), 30-m sprint (r=-0.425, P=0.016), and arrowhead agility tests (right, r=-0.389, P=0.023). These results suggest that higher FMS total scores could have a positive effect on the physical performance of the players.","This study examines the association between the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) total scores and physical performance in elite male collegiate soccer players. Key findings indicate that higher FMS total scores are linked to improved performance in sprinting and agility tests, underscoring the potential impact of functional movement assessments on athletic performance."
Kinematic analysis of soccer goalkeepers’ diving motion towards shots placed far away,2019-10-27,,,,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the biomechanical characteristics of soccer goalkeepers (GKs) diving for shots placed distantly from the GK. Fifteen collegiate male GKs and 13 collegiate male outfield players acting as strikers participated. The experimental situation involved shooting from inside the penalty area. The strikers were instructed to execute an instep kick placing the ball 16.5 m away from the GK after pushing the ball forward. The GKs were instructed to dive with a preparatory motion toward the shot ball. Three-dimensional coordinate data for the strikers and GKs were captured using 2 motion capture systems – one with 16 cameras for the GKs and the other with 8 cameras for the strikers (250Hz). The systems were synchronized with an analog signal via an A/D converter (1000 Hz) and input to a computer. The shooting areas were divided into 12 (i.e. 2 shooting directions to the right and left sides of the GKs, 2 shooting distances close to and far from the GKs, and 3 shot heights, close to the ground, and also at high and medium heights). The strikers were informed of the target shooting area randomly in each trial, and 213 trials in which the GKs dived toward shots placed in the far area were selected. We calculated the velocity of the center of gravity and the joint angles of the lower limbs. The major findings were as follows. 1) Regardless of shooting height, it appeared that the GKs performed almost the same motion until landing because they began to move after determining the diving direction. 2) In order to dive to lower-placed balls, leaning the trunk towards the diving direction was necessary to allow placement of the hand in the lower position. 3) Regardless of shooting height, the side contralateral (CS) to the leg in the diving direction had the same role of achieving movement of the center of gravity in the diving direction. 4) The GKs dived toward lower-placed shots by flexing the knee joint of their CS leg and the hip and knee joints of their ball side (BS) leg before the BS leg touched the ground. 5) The GKs dived towards individual shot heights by appropriately adjusting the posture of their BS leg before the BS leg touched the ground.","This paper investigates the kinematic characteristics of soccer goalkeepers' diving motions in response to shots placed at varying distances and heights. Key findings highlight that goalkeepers exhibit consistent diving movements regardless of shot height, with specific adjustments in trunk inclination and joint flexion crucial for effectively reaching low and high shots."
One-leg rise performance and associated knee kinematics in ACL-deficient and ACL-reconstructed persons 23 years post-injury,2019-10-25,,,,"Research indicates reduced knee function and stability decades after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Assessment requires reliable functional tests that discriminate such outcomes from asymptomatic knees, while providing suitable loading for different populations. The One-leg rise (OLR) test is common in clinics and research but lacks scientific evidence for its implementation. Our cross-sectional study compared performance including knee kinematics of the OLR between ACL-injured persons in the very long term to controls and between legs within these groups, and assessed the within-session reliability of the kinematics.Seventy ACL-injured individuals (mean age 46.9 ± 5.4 years) treated with either reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy (ACLR; n = 33) or physiotherapy alone (ACLPT; n = 37), on average 23 years post-injury, and 33 age- and sex-matched controls (CTRL) attempted the OLR. Participants completed as many repetitions as possible to a maximum of 50 while recorded by motion capture. We compared between all groups and between legs within groups for total repetitions and decomposed the OLR into movement phases to compare phase completion times, maximum and range of knee abduction and adduction angles, and mediolateral knee control in up to 10 repetitions per participant.ACLPT performed significantly fewer OLR repetitions with their injured leg compared to the CTRL non-dominant leg (medians 15 and 32, respectively) and showed significantly greater knee abduction than ACLR and CTRL (average 2.56°-3.69° depending on phase and leg). Distribution of repetitions differed between groups, revealing 59% of ACLPT unable to complete more than 20 repetitions on their injured leg compared to 33% ACLR and 36% CTRL for their injured and non-dominant leg, respectively. Within-session reliability of all kinematic variables for all groups and legs was high (ICC 3,10 0.97-1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, SEM 0.93-1.95°).Negative outcomes of OLR performance, particularly among ACLPT, confirm the need to address aberrant knee function and stability even decades post-ACL injury. Knee kinematics derived from the OLR were reliable for asymptomatic and ACL-injured knees. Development of the OLR protocol and analysis methods may improve its discriminative ability in identifying reduced knee function and stability among a range of clinical populations.","The paper investigates the long-term knee function and stability in ACL-injured individuals, comparing One-leg rise (OLR) performance and knee kinematics between ACL-deficient, ACL-reconstructed, and control groups. Results highlight the decreased performance and altered knee kinematics in those with ACL injuries, particularly those who only received physiotherapy, emphasizing the need for reliable assessment tools to evaluate knee function decades after injury."
Sports-Related Traumatic Brain Injury: Screening and Management,2019-10-24,,,,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) sustained during sports participation, also known as sport-related concussion, has received increasing attention due in large part to the growing public awareness of the risks of head injury exposure in sports and the long-term consequences of repetitive head trauma. This chapter will review the latest understanding of concussion pathophysiology and provide an up to date overview of the scientific evidence-based acute screening and detection methods available for laypersons and medical professionals providing frontline assessment for athletes. Lastly, a comprehensive summary of clinical management for recovery management and approaches for active rehabilitation will be covered.","This paper focuses on mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in sports, particularly sport-related concussions, highlighting the increasing awareness of their risks and long-term consequences.

Acute effects of differential learning on football kicking performance and in countermovement jump,2019-10-23,,,,"The aim of this study was to identify the acute effects of a differential-learning training program on football kicking performance and countermovement jump. Twenty youth Portuguese under-15 football players participated in this study. All players were exposed to two training approaches: i) traditional, in which the players performed a total of 36 kicks in a blocked and repetitive approach; and ii) differential learning, which consisted in the 36 kicks using differential variations in each kick. Football kicking impact and velocity were assessed using a Stalker radar gun, while the kicking accuracy was assessed by aggregating the total number of points achieved during 12 kicks into a goal, which was divided into quantifiable scoring zones. Lastly, leg power was measured using a countermovement jump. Measurements were performed at baseline, post-intervention, and following a 35-minute training match. The comparisons between the baseline and post-test revealed that the differential learning approach promoted a possibly ~5% increase in the countermovement jump (small effects) and a likely ~3% increase in the average velocity (small effects) when compared with the traditional training approach. From the accuracy perspective, there was a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-test and post-match in accurate kicks into zone 1 (centre of the goal) and a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-match in accurate kicks into zone 5 (lateral zones at short height) in the differential intervention. In turn, a small increase in the accurate kicks into zones 4 and 6 (lateral zones of the goal and nearest to the bar, respectively) was found from the baseline to the post-match in the differential intervention. Overall, the differential learning intervention was more beneficial than a traditional training protocol with respect to acute improvements in countermovement jump performance, football kicking velocity and higher scoring zones kicking accuracy.","This paper investigates the acute effects of a differential learning training program on football kicking performance and countermovement jump in youth players. The results indicate that the differential learning method led to small improvements in leg power and kicking velocity compared to traditional training, although it also resulted in mixed outcomes regarding accuracy in different goal zones."
Validity and reliability of an Australian football small-sided game to assess kicking proficiency,2019-10-19,,,,"In Australian Football (AF), small sided games have been used extensively as an alternative training method for technical and physical adaptations. Considering their application to AF, it is surprising a valid and reliable small-sided game kicking assessment remains absent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable 5v6 Australian football small-sided game kicking proficiency assessment. Youth male AF players (n = 145) from different stages within the AF talent pathway were recruited. Validity (i.e., logical and construct) and reliability (i.e., test re-test) were assessed. The largest kicking proficiency difference was between U13 and U16 players and between novice and sub-elite players. Between the ages of U16 and U18 kicking proficiency appears to stabilise. The Australian football small-sided kicking assessment was 97% successful in identifying players as either novice or sub-elite. Larger physical performance (i.e., odometer, m/min−1 and %HIR) outputs were noted between U14 and U18 players and novice and sub-elite players. Collectively, these findings suggest the Australian football small-sided kicking assessment is a valid and reliable AF kicking proficiency assessment tool and may provide worthwhile information to coaches regarding kicking performance along the AFL pathway, to profile player strengths whilst identifying specific areas of improvement.","The paper develops and validates a small-sided game assessment tool specifically for measuring kicking proficiency in Australian football players. Key findings indicate that the assessment is highly successful in distinguishing between novice and sub-elite players, and suggests it can help coaches profile player strengths and identify areas for improvement along the talent pathway."
"Practical Use of the Navigate Pain Application for the Assessment of the Area, Location, and Frequency of the Pain Location in Young Soccer Goalkeepers",2019-10-15,,,,"Next to winning, minimizing injuries during training and matches is one of the primary goals of professional team sports games. Soreness and pain can be early indicators and risk factors for acute or long‐term injuries. Monitoring pain intensity and duration, as well as potential sources, are useful for planning practices and can be effective means for preventing injury. The aim of this study was to assess the areas and locations of pain in young soccer goalkeepers during a training camp, and to differentiate the area and frequency between pain arising from the muscles (MP), joints (JP), or as a result of an impact (IP). Recordings of the MP, JP, and IP location along with the area were performed using digital body mapping software (Navigate Pain Android app, Aalborg University, Denmark) installed on a tablet personal computer at the end of each training day across a 5‐day training camp. There was a significant difference in the area between the three types of pain (p < 0.001). The post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the pixel areas of IP versus JP (p < 0.001), IP versus MP (p < 0.001), and JP versus MP (p < 0.001). There was no significant time‐effect for the IP area between 1‐5 days of training (p = 0.610), neither for MP (p = 0.118) or JP (p = 0.797) and no significant difference for all three pain areas between the front and the back side of the body. The body regions most often reported for MP were thighs, while for JP they were groin and hips, and for IP the hips, shoulders, and forearms were most frequently indicated. This is the first study to map and report the pain distribution associated with training across a 5‐day training camp in soccer goalkeepers, and these findings emphasize the value of using digital pain drawings clinically as well as for monitoring the health status of soccer players.","This paper investigates the pain locations and frequency among young soccer goalkeepers during a training camp, utilizing the Navigate Pain application for digital body mapping. The study identifies significant differences in pain areas linked to muscles, joints, and impacts, highlighting the relevance of monitoring pain distributions to inform injury prevention strategies."
Hamstring muscle elasticity differs in specialized high‐performance athletes,2019-10-08,,,,"The effect of training on hamstring flexibility has been widely assessed through the measurement of the maximal range of motion or passive torque. However, these global measures do not provide direct information on the passive muscle mechanical properties of individual muscle. This characterization is crucial to better understand the effect of interventions as selective adaptations may occur among synergist muscles. Taking advantage of shear wave elastography, we aimed to determine whether elite sport athletes exhibit different passive shear modulus of hamstring heads compared to controls. Passive shear modulus was measured on semitendinosus (ST), semimembranosus (SM), and biceps femoris (BF) using shear wave elastography with the knee flexed at 60° and 90°, and 90° of hip flexion. A total of 97 elite athletes from various sports including running sprint, figure skating, fencing, field hockey, taekwondo, basketball, and soccer and 12 controls were evaluated. The shear modulus measured at 60° of knee flexion was lower in SM for figure skating ( P &lt; .001; d = 1.8), taekwondo ( P &lt; .001; d = 2.1), fencing ( P = .024; d = 1.0), and soccer ( P = .011; d = 0.9) compared to controls, while no difference was found for athletic sprinters, field hockey, and basketball players. Shear modulus of the BF and ST muscle was not significantly different between controls and elite athletes, regardless of the sport specialization (all P values = 1). We provide evidence that the shear modulus of the SM is altered in athletes involved in elite sport practice performed over large range of motion and/or including substantial stretching program in training content (taekwondo, figure skating, fencing, and soccer).","This paper investigates the differences in hamstring muscle elasticity among elite athletes using shear wave elastography to measure passive shear modulus in various muscle heads. Key findings indicate that the shear modulus of the semimembranosus muscle differs significantly in athletes from specific sports, such as figure skating and soccer, suggesting that specialized training impacts muscle mechanical properties."
Acute Neuromuscular Activity in Selected Injury Prevention Exercises with App-Based versus Personal On-Site Instruction: A Randomized Cross-Sectional Study,2019-10-08,,,,"A significant step towards sport-related injury prevention is the introduction of easily accessible smartphone applications (apps). However, it is unknown whether this type of app-based instruction facilitates similar acute neuromuscular and biomechanical characteristics of the preventive exercises as achieved when instructed on-site by an expert. Thus, the aim was to evaluate acute neuromuscular characteristics observed during a single bout of selected lower extremity injury preventive exercises instructed by an on-screen app versus on-site individual instruction provided by a physiotherapist. In a cross-sectional study design, 47 female football and handball players were randomly assigned to receive app instruction (APP group) or on-site instruction provided by a physiotherapist (PHY group) while performing five lower extremity injury preventive exercises. The exercises performed comprised (1) one-legged balance on Airex, (2) vertical drop jump, (3) one-legged horizontal jump onto floor, (4) one-legged horizontal jump onto Airex, and (5) two-hand Kettlebell Swing. Primary outcome was hamstring (biceps femoris and semitendinosus) muscle activity. Secondary outcomes were quadriceps (vastus lateralis and medialis) muscle activity, as well as hip and knee joint angles. Muscle activity was monitored by surface electromyography (EMG) and normalized to the peak amplitude obtained during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC). Hip and knee joint angles were recorded by a 3D motion analysis system. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the differences between experimental conditions for each outcome variable. Medial hamstring (semitendinosus) muscle activity was significantly higher during one-legged jump onto Airex (17 percentage points (95% CI 7 to 27)) and Kettlebell Swing (19 percentage points (95% CI 2 to 36)) in the PHY group than the APP group. Likewise, the PHY group demonstrated 18 percentage points (95% CI 1 to 35) and 19 percentage points (95% CI 0 to 38), greater lateral quadriceps muscle (vastus lateralis) activity during one-legged jump onto floor and one-legged jump onto Airex, respectively, compared with that of the APP group. Complex exercises, i.e., Kettlebell Swing and one-legged jump onto Airex, are characterized by lower neuromuscular activity when using app-based instructions compared with on-site instruction provided by a physiotherapist. However, the effectiveness of app-based instruction versus on-site individual instruction in injury prevention interventions remains to be investigated in future longitudinally studies.","This paper evaluates the effectiveness of app-based versus on-site instruction by physiotherapists for injury prevention exercises in female football and handball players. The study finds that certain complex exercises showed significantly lower neuromuscular activity when instructed via an app compared to on-site instruction, highlighting a potential limitation of app-based instruction in achieving comparable neuromuscular outcomes."
Compression Garments Reduce Muscle Movement and Activation during Submaximal Running,2019-10-07,,,,"ABSTRACT Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of sports compression tights in reducing muscle movement and activation during running. Methods A total of 27 recreationally active males were recruited across two separate studies. For study 1, 13 participants (mean ± SD = 84.1 ± 9.4 kg, 22 ± 3 yr) completed two 4-min treadmill running bouts (2 min at 12 and 15 km·h −1 ) under two conditions: a no-compression control (CON 1 ) and compression (COMP). For study 2, 14 participants (77.8 ± 8.4 kg, 27 ± 5 yr) completed four 9-min treadmill running bouts (3 min at 8, 10, and 12 km·h −1 ) under four conditions: a no-compression control (CON 2 ) and three different commercially available compression tights (2XU, Nike, and Under Armor). Using Vicon 3D motion capture technology, lower limb muscle displacement was investigated in both study 1 (thigh and calf) and study 2 (vastus lateralis + medialis [VAS]; lateral + medial gastrocnemius [GAS]). In addition, study 2 investigated the effects of compression on soft tissue vibrations (root-mean-square of resultant acceleration, RMS A r ), muscle activation (iEMG), and running economy (oxygen consumption, V˙O 2 ) during treadmill running. Results Wearing compression during treadmill running reduced thigh and calf muscle displacement as compared with no compression (both studies), which was evident across all running speeds. Compression also reduced RMS A r and iEMG during treadmill running, but it had no effect on running economy (study 2). Conclusion Lower limb compression garments are effective in reducing muscle displacement, soft tissue vibrations, and muscle activation associated with the impact forces experienced during running.","The paper investigates the effects of sports compression tights on muscle movement and activation during submaximal running in recreationally active males. The findings demonstrate that wearing compression garments significantly reduces lower limb muscle displacement, soft tissue vibrations, and muscle activation without impacting running economy."
Head impact exposure in youth football—Are current interventions hitting the target?,2019-10-04,,,,"Restrictions on heading in youth football have been implemented in some countries to limit head impact exposure. However, current interventions remain poorly guided by evidence. Our objective was to quantify heading exposure in youth football, assessing the effects of sex and age. Football matches played during an international youth football tournament with no heading restrictions were directly observed, including players from both sexes (11‐19 years). The elite senior level was included for comparison, using video analysis. All heading events were registered, classified, and assigned to individual players. Heading rates were calculated for each sex and age group. We observed a total of 267 matches, corresponding to 4011 player hours (1927 player hours for females, 2083 player hours for males). Males headed more frequently than females (2.7 vs 1.8 headers/player hour; P &lt; .001). Heading rates increased with age (ANOVA, P &lt; .001), approaching the elite senior level for players 16 years and older. There was substantial variation within teams for all age and sex groups, with the widest range (1‐18 headers) observed for girls aged 19. Girls younger than 12 years had the lowest exposure, with an average of &lt;2 players per team heading the ball, each with 1‐2 headers. In conclusion, age and sex influence head impact exposure in youth football, and warrants careful consideration when introducing injury prevention measures. Males are more frequently exposed than females, heading rates increase with age, and there is substantial variation between players. Heading is a rare event in the youngest age groups, especially among females.","This paper investigates head impact exposure in youth football, focusing on how age and sex affect heading rates among players. It finds that males head the ball more frequently than females, heading rates increase with age, and highlights significant variability in heading exposure within and between teams, underscoring the need for evidence-based injury prevention measures."
Previous High School Participation in Varsity Sport and Jump-Landing Biomechanics in Adult Recreational Athletes,2019-10-01,,,,"Context Early sports sampling is associated with superior biomechanics in youth athletes; however, the effect of multisport participation on adult biomechanics is unknown. Objective To compare jump-landing biomechanics between adult recreational athletes who previously participated in 0, 1, or 2 or more select high school varsity sports (VSs; basketball, lacrosse, soccer, volleyball) that feature landing and cutting tasks. Design Descriptive laboratory study. Setting University community setting. Patients or Other Participants Fifty adult recreational athletes (22 women, 28 men; age = 23.8 ± 2.5 years) with no high school VS experience or with high school VS experience in basketball, lacrosse, soccer, or volleyball. Athletes were grouped into those who participated in 0 (0VS, n = 11), 1 (1VS, n = 21), or 2 or more (2VSs, n = 18) of these sports at the high school level. Main Outcome Measure(s) The average Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) total score from 3 individual jump landings was determined. A 1-way analysis of covariance using sex as the covariate was calculated to compare groups. The Pearson R was used to test for the correlation between the LESS score and number of sports played, and a linear regression analysis was performed using the number of sports played to predict the LESS score. The α level was set a priori at .05. Results The 0VS athletes produced similar LESS scores as the 1VS athletes (5.89 ± 1.2 versus 5.38 ± 1.93 points, respectively, P = .463), whereas the 2VSs athletes demonstrated lower LESS scores (3.56 ± 1.97 points) than the 0VS (P = .002) and 1VS (P = .004) athletes. The LESS scores were moderately negatively correlated with the number of high school VSs played (R2 = −0.491, P &amp;lt; .001). The linear regression analysis was significant (F1,37 = 9.416, P = .004) with R2 = 0.203. For every additional VS played at the high school level, the LESS score decreased by 1.28 points. Conclusions Landing Error Scoring System scores were lower in athletes who had a history of multisport high school varsity participation in basketball, lacrosse, soccer, or volleyball compared with those who had a history of single-sport or no participation in these sports at this level. Multisport high school varsity participation in these sports may result in improved neuromuscular performance and potentially reduced injury risks as adults.","This paper investigates the impact of high school varsity sport participation on jump-landing biomechanics in adult recreational athletes. It finds that those who participated in multiple high school varsity sports show significantly better landing biomechanics, as indicated by lower Landing Error Scoring System scores, compared to those with no or minimal varsity sport experience, suggesting a potential reduction in injury risk linked to early multisport participation."
Biomechanical mechanisms of jumping performance in youth elite female soccer players,2019-10-01,,,,"We aimed to determine key biomechanical parameters explaining age-related jumping performance differences in youth elite female soccer players. Multiple biomechanical parameters from countermovement (CMJ) squat (SJ) and drop (DJ) jump testing of elite female soccer players (n = 60) within the same national training centre were analysed across ages 9-11y, 12-14y and 15-19y. Effects of age group and jump type on jump height were found, with the older jumping higher than the younger groups in all jumps (P < 0.05). For DJ, higher reactive strength index was found for older, compared to each younger group (P < 0.001). For CMJ and SJ, peak power was the most decisive characteristic, with significant differences between each group for absolute peak power (P < 0.0001) and body-weight-normalised peak power in CMJ (57 ± 7W/kg, 50 ± 7W/kg, 44.7 ± 5.5W/kg; P < 0.05) and between the older and each younger group in SJ (56.7 ± 7.1W/kg, 48.9 ± 7.1W/kg, 44.6 ± 6W/kg; P < 0.01). Age-related differences in jumping performance in youth elite female soccer players appear to be due to power production during standing jumps and by the ability to jump with shorter ground contact times during reactive jumps.","This paper investigates the biomechanical parameters influencing age-related differences in jumping performance among youth elite female soccer players. The study finds that older players demonstrate higher jump heights and greater reactive strength and peak power, highlighting the impact of power production and ground contact time on jump performance across different age groups."

The data were collected through a questionnaire and the results collected were compared with a control group of 100 volunteers matched for age, weight and height, who did not present orthopedic diseases but had never practiced sport.In the study group, 26 subjects (25%) underwent hip and knee arthroplasty at an average mean age of 62.1±6 years. The frequency of arthroplasty was: 13.5% for the hip, 5.8% for the knee and 5.8% for both hip and knee. In the control group, the incidence of arthroplasty was 1% for the knee and no subjects presented hip arthroplasty.Italian male, former professional football players present a higher than normal incidence of hip and knee arthroplasty. Further studies are necessary to understand the pathological pathways underlying the etiology of hip and knee osteoarthritis in male populations of former professional football players in order to develop effective preventive programs to reduce the percentage of arthroplasties.","This study investigates the incidence of hip and knee arthroplasty among Italian male professional football players who have played for at least ten years in major leagues. The findings indicate that 25% of the former players underwent arthroplasty, significantly higher than the 1% incidence observed in a matched control group, highlighting the need for further research into the causes of osteoarthritis in this population to inform preventive measures."
A 9-month multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol based on early postoperative mobilization following a chronic-degenerative patellar tendon rupture in a professional soccer player,2019-10-01,,,,"BACKGROUND: Isolated patellar tendon rupture (PTR) is the final stage of a long-standing tendon chronic degeneration. PTR requires immediate repair in order to avoid important muscle retraction and tendon fibrosis. The aim was to describe the effects of a rehabilitation protocol after chronic-degenerative PTR on subjective functional outcomes, knee range of motion (ROM), size, and strength in a professional football player.CASE REPORT: A 26-years-old football player who experienced RPT after a 3-year history of proximal patellar tendinopathy. After early surgical repair of the tendon, the athlete underwent a 9-months multidisciplinary rehabilitation program, based on early postoperative mobilization.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Early knee mobilization and gradual controlled load from the second week determined a large increase in flexion ROM, muscular strength and trophy over the weeks by the athlete. Early surgical repair of PTR together with an early knee mobilization program demonstrated excellent results after a 9-months follow-up.","This paper discusses the effects of a 9-month multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol following a chronic-degenerative patellar tendon rupture in a professional soccer player.

Symptom Provocation Patterns During Supervised Exercise in Adolescent Athletes with Concussion,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To understand which exercises provoke symptoms, as well as the type and frequency of symptoms, during supervised exercise (SE) following concussion, and to better understand how to interpret and utilize findings during SE. <h3>Background</h3> Exercise is increasingly used in the management of sport-related concussion, and SE has been shown to be associated with faster clearance to return to sport. However, the optimal use of exercise following concussion is not known, and findings during SE have not been studied. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> This study is a retrospective review of patients seen at a sport concussion clinic. Participants were concussed athletes under age 18 who underwent SE within 30 days of concussion. A typical SE session began with a basic cardiovascular exercise followed by dynamic exercise challenges. Data recorded included exercise type, pre-exercise symptoms, symptom exacerbation scores, and maximum heart rate during exercise. A symptom was considered provoked if a new symptom developed or if an existing symptom increased by ≥3 points on a 10 point scale. Outcome measures were referral to vestibular physical therapy and the number of days from concussion until clearance for return to sport. Data were analyzed using two-sample t tests, linear and logistic regression models. <h3>Results</h3> 66.2% of patients experienced symptom provocation during SE. Symptom provocation did not occur until the dynamic challenge portion of the workout in 55.6% of those symptomatic. Dizziness was the most common symptom (48.5%), and medicine ball exercises (50.0%) the most common provoking exercise. Dizziness provoked during SE predicted referral to vestibular physical therapy (OR 5.90, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Provocation of symptoms during basic cardiovascular exercises predicted a greater number of days until clearance for return to sport (<i>p</i> = 0.015). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Symptom provocation during SE provides useful information in return to play decision making, guidance for physical thearpy treatments, and prognostication of recovery time following concussion.","The paper investigates the symptom provocation patterns during supervised exercise (SE) in adolescent athletes recovering from concussion. It establishes that a significant proportion of patients experience symptom provocation during SE, particularly during dynamic challenges, with dizziness being the most common symptom, and highlights the implications for return-to-play decisions and rehabilitation strategies."
Thalamic and thalamic projection abnormalities on DTI and NODDI analysis following acute concussion,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To compare preseason and post-concussive MRI in a cohort of collegiate football players utilizing Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) post processing. <h3>Background</h3> Acute post-concussive symptoms can vary in clinical characteristics and severity. However, vestibular and ocular dysfunction in particular, has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. The vestibular system comprises a complex network of projections from peripheral vestibular organs to thalamic relay systems and numerous cortical regions. The visual/oculomotor system is also complex, involving brainstem, subcortical-cortical and thalamo-cortical connections. Oculomotor deficits are thought to involve the midbrain and the visual and parietal association cortices, both of which have thalamic projections. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We gathered pre-season MR diffusion weighted imaging on a cohort of 30 collegiate football players. We performed repeat imaging within 36 hours of any diagnosed concussion in the same subject cohort. DTI metrics: mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) along with NODDI metric: orientation dispersion index (ODI), were analyzed for statistical comparisons between groups. <h3>Results</h3> 4 subjects with pre-season MRI underwent repeat MRI within 36 hours of concussive injury. A paired t-test between these two groups using DTI and NODDI metrics showed significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) decreases in: AD and MD in the left posterior thalamic radiations, FA in the column and body of the fornix, and MD in the right anterior corona radiata and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and a significant decrease in ODI in the anterior thalamus. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Disruptions in the thalamus and its white matter projections may play a role in the vestibular/ocular dysfunction associated with acute concussive injury. While our numbers are small, the findings suggest that DTI and NODDI processing techniques have the capability to locate and measure grey and white matter injury patterns after concussive injury.","This paper investigates changes in thalamic and white matter projections in collegiate football players following acute concussion using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI). The study found significant decreases in several DTI and NODDI metrics that may indicate disruptions in thalamic function, potentially contributing to vestibular and ocular dysfunction post-injury."
Transient perturbation in neuro-ophthalmologic function after repetitive subconcussive head impacts: a randomized controlled trial,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the effect of subconcussive head impacts on neuro-ophthalmologic function tested by the King-Devick test (KDT). <h3>Background</h3> Subconcussive head impacts can lead to insidious neurological impairment if sustained repetitively. The oculomotor system is sensitive to brain trauma; however, neuro-ophthalmologic response to subconcussive head impacts remain unclear. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Sixty-eight healthy adult soccer players with at least 5 years of soccer heading experience were randomized into either a soccer heading group (n = 36) or soccer kicking-control group (n = 32). The independent variables were group (heading vs. kicking control) and assessment time points (pre-, 0 hr-, 2 hr-, and 24 hr-post-heading/kicking). At each time point, KDT performance was assessed. Between the pre and 0hr post time points, heading subjects then performed 10 soccer headers, with the ball traveled at 25 mph, over the course of 10 minutes. The control subjects kicked the soccer ball 10 times. <h3>Results</h3> The heading group experienced a median linear head acceleration of 31.8<i>g</i> per head impact (IQR: 31.1–34.5<i>g</i>) and a median rotational head acceleration of 3.56 krad/sec<sup>2</sup> per head impact (IQR: 2.93–4.04 krad/sec<sup>2</sup>). Conversely, soccer kicks did not result in a detectable level of head acceleration. The kicking control group showed a significant improvement in KDT performance over time, indicating the neuro-ophthalmologic adaptability and learning effect (pre, 42.5 ± 5.7 sec; 0 hr-post, 39.3 ± 5.9 sec; 2 h-post, 38.5 ± 5.8 sec; 24 h-post, 37.3 ± 6.1 sec). However, such improvement was blunted by repetitive soccer headings in the heading group (pre, 43.6 ± 7.8 sec; 0 hr-post, 42.7 ± 7.9 sec; 2 h-post, 42.6 ± 7.8 sec; 24 h-post, 40.7 ± 7.3 sec), as illustrated by significant time × group interactions at 0 hr (<i>p</i> = 0.012) and 2 hr (<i>p</i> = 0.002) post-heading/kicking time points in the mixed-effect regression model. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our data suggest that the neural circuit encompassing the brain and oculomotor system has tremendous abilities to adapt and improve its function if administered repeatedly, but subconcussive head impacts induced by soccer heading can transiently impair neuro-ophthalmologic function and its adaptive property.","This paper investigates the effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts on neuro-ophthalmologic function in soccer players, assessed through the King-Devick test. Findings reveal that while soccer kicking showed performance improvement over time, repeated headers led to a transient decline in neuro-ophthalmologic function, highlighting potential risks associated with heading in football."
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy – a study in Brazilian retired soccer players,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> Evaluate the neurological, neuopsychological and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in a cohort of retired soccer players. <h3>Background</h3> Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is considered to be a consequence of exposure to repeated head traumas, but evidence suggests that a single moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can also induce progressive neuropathological changes. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Prospective observational study that evaluated 26 retired soccer players and 14 controls. The retired athletes and controls were submitted to neurological evaluation, neuropsychological evaluation and EEG. <h3>Results</h3> In general, the soccer players performed well in tests, within the normal range. 15 soccer players had a history of previous TBI/concussion. In the retired group the average age was 60.4 years (55.7 in the CG), average of 11.7 schooling years (13.7 in the CG). The average results in MMSE was 26.6 (29 in the CG), the average digit span in backwards was 3.1 (3.8 in the CG), the average verbal fluency for animals was 15.6 (24 in the CG) and the average clock-drawing test was 8.96 (9 in the CG). Visual EEG analysis showed a predominance of posterior alpha activity between 9.0 and 12.0 Hz (mean 10.3 Hz) in the soccer participants and 11 Hz in the control group (CG). The analysis wiht low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed that 11 soccer players had hippocampal asymmetry (5 had less activity in the right hippocampus and 6 had less activity in the left hippocampus). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Although the performance of the athletes in the tests was within the normal range, the means were always inferior to those of the controls. Almost half of the players presented asymmetry in the analysis by LORETA, although visual EEG analysis was normal. This may indicate that EEG changes may be earlier and more sensitive than clinical changes. These data are preliminary and further analysis are needed.","This study evaluates the neurological and neuropsychological effects of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a cohort of retired Brazilian soccer players compared to a control group. Despite normal test performances, the findings indicate potential subtle neurological changes, such as hippocampal asymmetry in nearly half of the retired players, suggesting that EEG changes may precede clinical symptoms."
Residual Deficits in Vestibular Function Exist Following Return to Sports Participation from Concussion,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> Determine if collegiate athletes exhibit residual deficits in vestibular function at the time of unrestricted return to participation (RTP) following a sports-related concussion (SRC). <h3>Background</h3> It has been well documented that afferent vestibular pathways are disrupted after SRC. This includes both the vestibular-ocular and vestibulospinal reflexes which mediate dynamic vision and postural stability. However, few studies have determined if vestibular function is recovered in athletes at the time of RTP from SRC. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Twenty-six NCAA Division-I athletes (1.77 ± 0.14 m, 92.81 ± 31.30 kg, 10 females, 16 males) performed the Concussion Balance Test (COBALT), the Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT), and Gaze Stability Test (GST). Thirteen athletes were tested within 14 days of RTP following SRC. Thirteen athletes with no history of SRC were matched to the RTP group based on age, sex, and sport to serve as healthy controls (HC). Paired t-tests with corresponding effect sizes compared COBALT, DVAT, and GST scores between groups (SRC, HC). For all tests, the alpha level was set a priori at 0.10. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-six NCAA Division-I athletes (1.77 ± 0.14 m, 92.81 ± 31.30 kg, 10 females, 16 males) performed the Concussion Balance Test (COBALT), the Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT), and Gaze Stability Test (GST). Thirteen athletes were tested within 14 days of RTP following SRC. Thirteen athletes with no history of SRC were matched to the RTP group based on age, sex, and sport to serve as healthy controls (HC). Paired t-tests with corresponding effect sizes compared COBALT, DVAT, and GST scores between groups (SRC, HC). For all tests, the alpha level was set a priori at 0.10. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our preliminary findings suggest that collegiate athletes who return to participation from SRC may experience residual deficits in postural control and visual acuity with dynamic head movements that challenge the vestibular system. Therefore, objective measures of vestibular function may be beneficial to ensure postural control and visual acuity are restored at RTP following SRC.","This paper investigates the residual deficits in vestibular function in collegiate athletes at the time of unrestricted return to participation following a sports-related concussion. The findings indicate that athletes may experience lingering impairments in postural control and dynamic visual acuity, suggesting the need for objective assessment of vestibular function before returning to sport."
High Energy American Football Head Impacts to the Side and Rear Damaging Than to the Front,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to investigate head impact doses in American football. We analyzed time-synchronized video and data collected during n = 445 player-games of American football resulting in 2851video-verified impacts. Cases where a player sustained impacts and on video was demonstrably witnessed to meet the NFL's ""No-go"" criteria were analyzed in-depth. <h3>Background</h3> In 2011, after reviewing scalar on-field kinematics data leading concussion clinicians concluded <i>""Recent studies suggest that a concussive injury threshold is elusive, and may, in fact, be irrelevant when predicting the clinical outcome</i>"".<sup>1</sup> It is likely that higher fidelity estimates of spatial and temporal impact parameters will clarify the currently unclear impact dose-response relationship. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A total of 2851 video-verified head impacts were identified from 445 player-games. Each event was time-synchronized to video. Any events collected when the athlete was not being impacted in the head were discarded. The remaining true positive events were scrutinized based on published methods to confirm a head impact occurred in the video and the computed motion was physically realistic and matched the video. <h3>Results</h3> We found a median of 5 video-verified head impacts per player-game, which is far fewer than published studies without video verification.<sup>11</sup> For the four players with ""No-go"" impacts, all were to the side/rear. Coronal plane impact sensitivity has been a hypothesized clinical injury mechanism<sup>12</sup> and our results support that hypothesis. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We did not see high PLA/PAA impacts without obvious player ""No-go"" observations. This finding disagrees with other studies that have reported high PLA/PAA impacts without any demonstrable ""No-go"" observations<sup>13</sup>. High energy impacts to the side and rear of the head are more damaging than similar magnitude impacts to the forehead. Armed with this knowledge, clinicians should have more fidelity in their understanding of real-time impact location and severity, and how it relates to athlete concussion risk.","This study investigates the characteristics of head impacts in American football by analyzing 2851 video-verified incidents across 445 games. The findings indicate that impacts to the side and rear of the head are more damaging compared to those to the front, supporting the notion that the location of impacts is crucial for assessing concussion risk in athletes."
Concussion prevention strategies: A Survey of division I and division II female soccer teams,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this study is to evaluate concussion prevention strategies being used in NCAA Division I and Division II women9s soccer and characterize the beliefs of Certified Athletic Trainers (ATs) on concussion prevention methods. <h3>Background</h3> While much attention has been paid to decreasing concussion rates in collegiate woman9s soccer, it is unknown what prevention strategies are currently being performed. Additionally, ATs' beliefs on the efficacy of concussion prevention practices for these athletes is unknown. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Participants included ATs employed at any of the 334 Division I or 273 Division II universities working with woman9s soccer. A survey instrument of structured questions followed by open-ended follow up questions was developed to identify if teams utilized cervical strengthening programs, headgear, or other techniques for concussion prevention. Questions also address ATs9 beliefs on the effectiveness of cervical strengthening, headgear and mouthguards in concussion prevention. Data were collected via questionnaire e-mailed through Qualtrics survey software. Responses were received from 222 ATs (37.8% response rate). Data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. <h3>Results</h3> Some form of cervical strengthening or stability for concussion prevention was performed by 38 teams (17.12%) and seven (3.15%) were unsure. The majority (69.86%) believe such programs will aid in concussion prevention. Equipment for concussion prevention was report by 36 (16.59%). Text responses included mouthpieces (n = 3) and headgear (n = 31). Seventy-eight (35.49%) reported players on their team wear headgear. Nineteen (8.76%) believe headgear prevents concussions. Forty-five (20.74%) believe mouthguards prevent concussions. Proper soccer technique is implemented by 151 (69.59%) and 14 (0.06%) cite nutritional strategies for concussion prevention. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Although most ATs believe that cervical strengthening aids concussion prevention, few programs are implementing this strategy. Disconnect exists between available evidence and the perceptions held by ATs regarding mouthguards and headgear for concussion prevention.","This paper evaluates the concussion prevention strategies implemented by NCAA Division I and Division II women's soccer teams and assesses the beliefs of Certified Athletic Trainers regarding these methods. The findings indicate a significant gap between the perceived effectiveness of strategies such as cervical strengthening and the actual implementation of these programs, highlighting a disconnect between available evidence and ATs' perceptions of mouthguards and headgear in preventing concussions."
Effects of football practice on blink reflex parameters in Division I football athletes,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The objective was to access the effects of football practice sessions on blink reflex parameters using the Eyestat. <h3>Background</h3> Our laboratory has utilized a potential objective measure to identify concussions. This technology, called Eyestat, is a noninvasive diagnostic tool measuring changes in blink reflex parameters. Prior research cited significant differences in various blink reflex parameters between active play, concussion, and baseline; however, the number of subjects for the active play population was small (N = 10). Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify blink reflex parameters during football practice, providing outcomes potentially helpful with its use for a concussed population. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Forty-seven Division I male football players between the ages of 18-22 were evaluated on multiple sessions during a 2 week period of football practices. During various points of the practice, subjects completed the blink test and had their heart rate assessed. During the blink test, subjects placed their face against the apparatus, which directed a puff of air to the corner of the subject's eye to stimulate the blink. Five puffs were administered in a random fashion over a 20 second period in which videography captured and recorded the blink. <h3>Results</h3> Results of the study found significant differences in latency (<i>p</i> = 0.0000), time under the threshold (<i>p</i> = 0.0176), oscillations (<i>p</i> = 0.0217) and excursion (<i>p</i> = 0.0003), but no significant differences in differential latency (<i>p</i> = 0.0626). Average heart rate was 125 BPM, with a minimum of 72 BPM and maximum of 172 BPM. The results of this study correlate with prior research in latency, time under the threshold and excursions and support the changes in blink reflex parameters after football practice. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Future studies need to assess if changes occur with individual physical activity or is it related only to the practice of this sport.","This paper investigates the effects of football practice sessions on blink reflex parameters in Division I football athletes using the noninvasive Eyestat tool. The study found significant differences in various blink reflex measures following practice, suggesting the potential of these parameters for monitoring concussion effects in athletes."
Age of first exposure to soccer heading and sensory reweighting for upright stance,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To compare sensory reweighting for upright stance between soccer players who began soccer heading before age 10 years (AFE ≤ 10) and those who began soccer heading after age 10 years (AFE &gt; 10). <h3>Background</h3> In 2015, US Soccer announced an initiative to eliminate soccer heading for youth players ages 10 years and younger and to limit soccer heading for children ages 11 to 13 years. Limited empirical evidence associates soccer heading during early adolescence and long-term behavioral deficits. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Thirty college-aged soccer players self-reported AFE to soccer heading. Sensory reweighting was compared between AFE ≤ 10 [n = 19, 11 males (58%), 22 ± 3 years, 171 ± 9 cm, 70 ± 11 kg, 5 with concussion history (26%)] and AFE &gt; 10 [N = 11, 5 males (45%), 22 ± 2 years, 172 ± 7 cm, 69 ± 13 kg, 3 with concussion history (27%)]. To evaluate sensory reweighting, we simultaneously perturbed upright stance with visual (i.e., moving visual scene at 0.2 Hz), vestibular (i.e., ±1 mA bilateral monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulus (GVS) at 0.36 Hz), and proprioceptive stimulation (i.e., 80 Hz vibratory stimulus to their bilateral Achilles tendons at 0.28 Hz). The visual stimulus was presented at different amplitudes (i.e., 0.2 m, 0.8 m in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction) to measure the leg-segment AP displacement change in gain to vision, an intramodal effect; and change in gain to GVS and vibration, both intermodal effects. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare sensory reweighting between groups. <h3>Results</h3> There were no differences in gain to vision (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.033, <i>p</i> = 0.857, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.001), gain to GVS (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.971, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.000), or gain to vibration (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.974, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.000), and no differences in sensory reweighting (i.e. conditionXgroup effect; vision, F<sub>3,84</sub> = 0.160, <i>p</i> = 0.923, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.006; GVS, F<sub>3,84</sub> = 0.043, <i>p</i> = 0.988, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.002; vibration, F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.068, <i>p</i> = 0.797, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.002). <h3>Conclusions</h3> There were no differences in sensory processing for upright stance between AFE ≤ 10 and AFE &gt; 10, suggesting that soccer heading during early adolescence is not associated with balance deficits in college-aged soccer players, notwithstanding potential deficits in other markers of neurological function.","This paper examines the impact of the age of first exposure (AFE) to soccer heading on sensory reweighting for upright stance in college-aged soccer players. The findings indicate no significant differences in sensory processing or balance deficits between players who began heading before and after age 10, suggesting that early exposure to heading may not correlate with long-term balance issues."
"Concussion History, Career Status and Cumulative Years of Football Exposure Influence Concussion Assessment Performance in Elite Football Players",2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To explore relationship of concussion history, career status, and cumulative years of contact football exposure on total symptoms, symptom severity, neurocognitive function, and balance in elite football players. <h3>Background</h3> 61% of retired football players report sustaining a concussion during their professional career. However, the influence of concussion history, career status and cumulative years played on total symptoms, symptom severity, neurocognitive function, and balance is largely unexplored. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Elite football players (n = 102; age <i>M</i> = 27.75 ± 6.95 years) without a concussion (&gt;30 days) underwent SCAT-3 assessments. Players were placed into a low (0–1) or multiple concussion (2+) history group and categorized by career status (draft prospects, active professional players and retired professional players). Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression and multiple linear regression analyses. <h3>Results</h3> 58.8% of players reported symptoms. Most common symptoms were fatigue (33.3%), trouble falling asleep (31.4%), difficulty remembering (29.4%), and difficulty concentrating (20.6%). Multiple concussions group reported 3.07 times greater total symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), 3.58 times higher symptom severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and lower SAC scores (1.42 points) (<i>p</i> = 0.033) compared to low concussion group. Professionals reported 1.88 times greater total symptoms (<i>p</i> = .038) and 2.35 times higher symptom severity compared to draft prospects (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Retired players reported 7.07 times greater total symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), 8.97 times higher symptom severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), lower SAC scores (1.98 points) (<i>p</i> = 0.025), and 3.67 more m-BESS errors (<i>p</i> = 0.002), compared to draft prospects. Players with 11–19 years football exposure reported 3.83 times higher symptom severity compared to players with &lt;11 years football exposure (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Players with &gt;19 years football exposure had 6.87 times higher symptom severity than players with &lt;11 years football exposure (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Retired players with multiple concussions and 19+ years of contact football exposure are likely to have more symptoms, higher symptom severity, and lower neurocognitive scores.","This paper investigates the impact of concussion history, career status, and the duration of exposure to contact football on symptoms, severity, and neurocognitive function in elite football players.

Observational Study of Prevention and Intervention Strategies That Help Speed Return to Play Post-Concussion in Division I College Football,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> We present evidence that a neurovisual oriented training program is associated with decreased concussion incidence and faster return to play (RTP) post injury in this observational cohort study. <h3>Background</h3> Sports concussion has been in the public eye and has been associated with heightened fear concerning playing football and other collision based sports. Protecting from concussion and rehabilitating the brain after a concussion is a high priority for many sports medical practitioners as well as for athletes wanting to play. For these reasons researchers associated with the American Athletic Conference (AAC) have been monitoring concussion incidence in football. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> The 12 schools of the AAC were surveyed for 2014, 2015, and 2016 concerning football induced concussions. <h3>Results</h3> The average seasonal concussion rate was 10.4 ± 1.02 concussions per year and average RTP time was 13.2 ± 1.21 days. In the one team where there was an aggressive neuro visual conditioning and rehabilitation post-concussion program employed the concussion rate was 3.0 ± 1.0 concussions per year and the RTP time was 6.5 ± 0.5 days. Both numbers are significantly lower than in the other AAC teams. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The current paper reports that there may be mitigation strategies that can be employed to decrease concussion incidence as well as aid in faster RTP times. Such attempts to make football safer are needed as brain injury has been associated with long term consequences. Improving safety and brain health through mitigation strategies along with rehabilitation methods may aid in keeping athletes safer during play and throughout the lifespan.",This paper investigates the effectiveness of a neurovisual oriented training program in reducing concussion incidence and facilitating quicker return to play (RTP) among Division I college football players. The findings suggest that this training can significantly decrease concussion rates and RTP times compared to other teams lacking such interventions.
Return to Sport Following Turf Toe Injuries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2019-10-01,,,,"Category: Sports Introduction/Purpose: The prevalence of turf toe injuries has increased in recent years due to heightened awareness and the large number of athletes participating in sports today. Uncertainty remains, however, as to how to properly treat turf toe and the prognosis for these injured athletes. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to provide recommendations on treatment of turf toe and expectations for outcomes and return to play. Methods: Following PRISMA criteria, a systematic review and meta-analysis using the PubMed/Ovid Medline/PMC databases was performed (May 1964 – August 2018). Studies evaluating non-turf toe injuries, biomechanical studies, and those written in non- English language were excluded. Return to sport, treatment, severity of injury, athletic position, and sport were recorded and statistically analyzed. Results: 12/944 studies met criteria, which included 112 athletes and 120 turf toe injuries. The athletes played a variety of sports: football (111), basketball (2), soccer (1), and track (3). 58 of these injuries were treated non-operatively, while 62 required surgery. There was one grade 1 injury, ten grade 2 injuries, and fifty-four grade 3 injuries. Fifty-five injuries were unclassifiable and excluded. Return to sport for patients treated non-operatively was 5.9 weeks versus 19.2 weeks in patients treated operatively (p=0.007). Patients with a grade 2 injury returned to sport quicker (11.7 weeks) than patients with grade 3 injuries (19.9 weeks) (p=0.016). Return to play was different according to the athlete’s level of play (13.9 weeks high school, 16.8 weeks college, 14.4 weeks professional) (p=0.018). Conclusion: Return to sport in patients suffering from a turf toe injury can be affected by either the severity of injury and/or level of competition of the athlete. However, this study also acknowledges the limited number of high level studies evaluating turf toe in the athletic population. Further research is necessary to clearly define appropriate treatment and return to play protocols based on sport, position, and level of play.","This paper systematically reviews and analyzes the treatment and prognosis of turf toe injuries in athletes, highlighting the differences in return-to-sport timelines based on the severity of the injury and the level of competition. Key findings indicate that non-operative treatments result in a quicker return to play compared to surgical interventions, with significant variations noted between injury grades and athletic levels."
Estimated age of first exposure to American football and outcome from concussion,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the association between estimated age of first exposure (eAFE) to American football and clinical measures throughout recovery following concussion. <h3>Background</h3> In collegiate football players, we reported no association between eAFE and baseline neurocognitive function. It is possible that neurocognitive deficits from earlier eAFE to American football, if present, are sufficiently compensated for in otherwise healthy individuals, but when faced with concussion, earlier eAFE may associate with longer symptom recovery, worse cognitive performance, or greater psychological distress. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Participants were recruited as part of the NCAA–DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium. There were 340 NCAA football players (age = 18.9 ± 1.4 years) who were evaluated 24–48 hours following concussion and had valid baseline data and 360 (age = 19.0 ± 1.3 years) who were evaluated at the time they were asymptomatic and had valid baseline data. Participants sustained a medically-diagnosed concussion between baseline testing and post-concussion assessments. Outcome measures included the number of days until asymptomatic, Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) composite scores, Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18) sub-scores, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. The eAFE was defined as the participant's age at the time of assessment minus the self-reported number of years playing football. <h3>Results</h3> Results of generalized linear modeling suggested that younger eAFE was only associated with lower (better) BSI-18 Somatization (estimate = 0.046, <i>p</i> = 0.046, CI = 0.001–0.091) and BSI-18 Anxiety sub-scores (estimate = 0.053, <i>p</i> = 0.039, CI = 0.003–0.104) at 24–48 hours. The eAFE was not associated with days until asymptomatic, ImPACT composite scores, HADS scores, or other BSI-18 sub-scores. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Earlier eAFE to football was not associated with longer symptom recovery, worse cognitive performance, or greater psychological distress following concussion. Longer duration of exposure to football during childhood and adolescence appears to be unrelated to clinical recovery following concussion.","This paper investigates the relationship between estimated age of first exposure (eAFE) to American football and recovery outcomes following concussion in collegiate football players. The study concludes that earlier eAFE does not correlate with prolonged symptom recovery, poorer cognitive performance, or increased psychological distress post-concussion."
Early postural adjustments in football players with cerebral palsy,2019-09-30,,,,"Introduction: The functional limitations associated with Cerebral Palsy (CP) and inactivity are directly related to the deficit in postural control, namely the Early Postural Adjustments (EPAs). On the other hand, same studies showed that the practice of physical exercise can improve stability. Objectives: Thus, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the influence of physical exercise, in this case in a football player, on the EPAs of athletes with CP. Methods: The study included 5 young male adults with CP, aged between 18 and 36 years old, all football players, class 7 and 8.The electromyographic activity was recorded using Delsys Trigno and the ratio of the postural musculature [soleus (SO) and tibialis anterior (TA)] prior to a step motion, as well as the center of pressure displacement amplitude were calculated through the force platforms (Bertec), before and after a 4 month interval of training. The two moments of evaluation were compared using the Wilcoxon test and the Spearman correlation between the CoP amplitude and the muscular activity ratio was calculated.Participants were recruited in a first period in which they had no physical activity at all and in the following 4 months they started training regularly, with a frequency of three times a week for 1h30min, always with the same trainer and in the same physical training space. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in the anterior CoP amplitude (-4.47cm; p=0.043) after 4 months, with a negative correlation between this amplitude and the ratio of TA / SO (r=-0.90; p=0.037). In the lateral direction, a diminution of amplitude of minimum CoP (-1.49; p=0.893) without statistically significant correlation (r=0.10; p=0.873) was found. Conclusions: Practicing sport, even in pathology, has a significant effect on the improvement of postural oscillation, with an increase in the relationship between muscular activity and postural control.","This paper investigates the influence of physical exercise on Early Postural Adjustments (EPAs) in young male football players with cerebral palsy (CP). The study finds a significant reduction in center of pressure amplitude after a four-month training period, indicating that regular physical activity improves postural control in athletes with CP."

Using Virtual Environments to Improve Real-World Motor Skills in Sports: A Systematic Review,2019-09-20,,,,"In many settings, sports training can be difficult to organise, logistically complicated and very costly. Virtual environments (VE) have garnered interest as a tool to train real-world sports skills due to the realism and flexibility that they can deliver. A key assumption of VE-based training is that the learned skills and experiences transfer to the real world, but do they? Using PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review evaluated the available evidence regarding the transfer of motor skills from VE training to real-world sporting contexts. The initial search identified 448 articles, but only 4 of these articles met basic criteria necessary to assess real-world transfer. Key factors regarding the study design, learner characteristics and training environment of these studies are considered. In a relatively new area of research, the findings from these 4 articles are encouraging and provide initial support for the notion that skills training in a VE can improve real-world performance in sports. However, for a wider uptake of VEs in sports training, it is important that more research demonstrates real-world transfer. Study design recommendations are suggested for researchers, developers or trainers who are considering demonstrating real-world transfers from virtual to real-world environments.","This systematic review explores the effectiveness of virtual environments (VE) in transferring motor skills to real-world sports contexts. The findings from the limited studies examined suggest that VE training can enhance real-world performance, but further research is needed to establish stronger evidence for this transfer."
Limited positive effects on jump-landing technique in girls but not in boys after 8 weeks of injury prevention exercise training in youth football,2019-09-20,,,,"To evaluate changes in jump-landing technique in football-playing boys and girls after 8 weeks of injury prevention training.Four boys' and four girls' teams (mean age 14.1 ± 0.8 years) were instructed to use either the original Knee Control injury prevention exercise programme (IPEP) or a further developed IPEP, Knee Control + , at every training session for 8 weeks. Baseline and follow-up testing of jump-landing technique included drop vertical jumps (DVJ), assessed subjectively and with two-dimensional movement analysis, and tuck jump assessment (TJA).Only minor differences in intervention effects were seen between the two IPEPs, and results are therefore presented for both intervention groups combined. At baseline 30% of the boys showed good knee control during the DVJ, normalised knee separation distances of 77-96% (versus hip) and a median of 3 flaws during the TJA. Among girls, 22% showed good knee control, normalised knee separation distances of 67-86% and a median of 4 flaws during the TJA. At follow-up, boys and girls performed significantly more jumps during TJA. No changes in jump-landing technique were seen in boys, whereas girls improved their knee flexion angle at initial contact in the DVJ (mean change + 4.7°, p < 0.001, 95% CI 2.36-6.99, d = 0.7) and their TJA total score (- 1 point, p = 0.045, r = - 0.4).The study showed small positive effects on jump-landing technique in girls, but not in boys, after 8 weeks of injury prevention training.Level II.Clinical Trials gov identifier: NCT03251404.","The paper evaluates the impact of an injury prevention training program on jump-landing technique in youth football players, focusing on both boys and girls over an 8-week period. The findings reveal that while girls showed minor improvements in knee flexion during jump-landing, boys did not exhibit significant changes in technique."
Change of Direction Assessment Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Review of Current Practice and Considerations to Enhance Practical Application,2019-09-17,,,,"Change of direction (CoD) has been indicated as a key mechanism in the occurrence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during invasion sports. Despite these associations, assessments of knee function in athletic populations at the time of return to sport following ACL reconstruction (ACLr) have often focused on strength and single-leg hop tests, with a paucity of evidence to describe the CoD characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review was to describe the movement strategies exhibited following ACLr during CoD tasks and to critically analyze the range of tests that have been used. Specifically, we examined their ability to identify between-limb deficits and individuals who display a heightened risk of secondary injury and/or reductions in their level of pre-injury performance. MEDLINE, PubMed and SPORT Discuss databases were used and 13 articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Examination of the available literature indicates that current field-based practices are not representative of relevant sport demands and are unable to effectively assess knee function following ACLr. Laboratory-based studies have identified residual deficits and altered movement strategies at the time of return to sport, and this in part may be related to risk of re-injury. However, these assessments exhibit inherent limitations and are not practically viable for monitoring progress during rehabilitation. Consequently, alternative solutions that are more-aligned with the multitude of factors occurring during CoD maneuvers in chaotic sports environments are warranted to allow practitioners to 'bridge the gap' between the laboratory and the sports field/court. This approach may facilitate a more informed decision-making process with the end goal being, a heightened 'return to performance' and a lower risk of re-injury.","The paper reviews current practices for assessing change of direction (CoD) following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, highlighting the inadequacy of traditional strength and single-leg hop tests. It suggests that existing assessments do not reflect the demands of sporting activities and calls for alternative methods that better account for the complexities of CoD in chaotic sports environments to improve rehabilitation outcomes and reduce re-injury risk."
Medial tibial stres sendromlu sporcularda ayak bileği izokinetik kas kuvveti ve naviküler çökme miktarı,2019-09-16,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare some anatomical features and ankle isokinetic muscle strength of adolescent athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) and healthy control group and to examine the adequacy of ‘tibial facial traction theory in the development of MTSS.Materials and Methods: Adolescent athletes who had been diagnosed with MTSS during the season and healthy control group participants were included in the study. Demographic data and training details of the athletes were recorded. The MTSS score was used to determine the severity of the injury. The navicular drop test, lower extremity length measurement, and isokinetic muscle strength measurement were performed. Results: The complaint duration of the patients with MTSS (n:21) was 1.8 ± 1.8 months and the MTSS score was 3.9 ± 2.2. The control group (n:12) and the athletes diagnosed with MTSS had similar demographic characteristics and training details. There was no difference between the groups in terms of navicular drop and lower extremity length. There was no ‘lower extremity difference’ for right and left extremities. According to the results of the isokinetic muscle strength test in plantarflexion and dorsiflexion direction, there was no difference between the groups in terms of muscle strength at both low and high angular speeds. Conclusion: ‘The tibial traction theory’ does not sufficiently explain the pathogenesis of MTSS. Studies which evaluate isokinetic muscle strength and perform real-time dynamic analysis on the track are required to make recommendations for ideal protection and rehabilitation in cases of MTSS.","This study compares anatomical features and ankle isokinetic muscle strength in adolescent athletes with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) and a healthy control group.

ULOGA FIZIOTERAPEUTA U PREPOZNAVANJU I LIJEČENJU STRES FRAKTURA KOD SPORTAŠA,2019-09-16,,,,"Stress fracture is a partial or complete bone fracture resulting from repeated application of stress that is lower than the stress needed for bone fracture at one load. Factors favoring its incurrence are: age and gender, type of sport activity, biomechanical factors, muscles, training errors, groundwork, sports footwear and hormonal imbalance. Most affected are athletes involved in sports where strong kicks are present (running, basketball, soccer and gymnastics). For the diagnosis of stress fractures most commonly used are clinical diagnostics, radiological diagnostics, scintigraphy and differential diagnosis. The prevention of such an injury requires the identification and elimination of risk factors associated with participation in contact sports, as well as the development of training plans and programs tailored for every sport and athlete. Also important for prevention is a quality co-operation between doctors, athletes and trainers, as well as regular conditional preparation, timely treatment of injuries and the compilation of a rehabilitation program. As far as rehabilitation itself is concerned, it starts immediately after injury, and it includes rest and immobilization, isometric exercises, balance exercises and proprioception, hydrotherapy, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, LASER, magnetotherapy, sports massage, stretching, regeneration methods, proprioceptive training, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), nuclear neurodynamics (NDS), manual techniques (mobilization and manipulation techniques, Kaltenborn Evens, Cyriax, Maitland, McKenzie), Kinesiotape, soft tissue techniques (fascial manipulation, friction massage, functional massages), Emmett, Bowen, Rolfing, Yumeiho, Theraband, bandages etc.","The paper discusses the role of physiotherapists in recognizing and treating stress fractures in athletes, highlighting factors such as age, gender, sport type, and biomechanical influences that contribute to these injuries.

Development and Multi-Scale Validation of a Finite Element Football Helmet Model,2019-09-13,,,,"Head injury is a growing concern within contact sports, including American football. Computational tools such as finite element (FE) models provide an avenue for researchers to study, and potentially optimize safety tools, such as helmets. The goal of this study was to develop an accurate representative helmet model that could be used in further study of head injury to mitigate the toll of concussions in contact sports. An FE model of a Schutt Air XP Pro football helmet was developed through three major steps: geometry development, material characterization, and model validation. The fully assembled helmet model was fit onto a Hybrid III dummy head-neck model and National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) head model and validated through a series of 67 representative impacts similar to those experienced by a football player. The kinematic and kinetic response of the model was compared to the response of the physical experiments, which included force, head linear acceleration, head angular velocity, and carriage acceleration. The outputs between the model and the physical tests were quantitatively evaluated using CORelation and Analysis (CORA), amounting to an overall averaged score of 0.76. The model described in this study has been extensively validated and can function as a building block for innovation in player safety.","This paper focuses on the development and validation of a finite element (FE) model of a football helmet to study and optimize player safety in contact sports. It details the processes of geometry development, material characterization, and validation against real impact tests, achieving a significant correlation score and positioning the model as a foundation for future research on head injury mitigation."
Comparing inertial measurement units and marker‐based biomechanical models during dynamic rotation of the torso,2019-09-12,,,,"Abstract Inertial measurement units (IMUs) enable human movements to be captured in the field and are being used increasingly in high performance sport. One key metric that can be derived from IMUs are relative angles of body segments which are important for monitoring form in many sports. The purpose of this study was to (a) examine the validity of relative angles derived from IMUs placed on the torso and pelvis; and (b) determine optimal positioning for torso mounted sensors such that the IMU relative angles match closely with gold standard torso–pelvis and thorax–pelvis relative angle data derived from an optoelectronic camera system. Seventeen adult participants undertook a variety of motion tasks. Four IMUs were positioned on the torso and one was positioned on the pelvis between the posterior superior iliac spines. Reflective markers were positioned around each IMU and over torso and pelvis landmarks. Results showed that the IMUs are valid with the root mean square errors expressed as a percentage of the angle range (RMSE%) ranging between 1% and 7%. Comparison between the IMU relative angles and the torso–pelvis and thorax–pelvis relative angles showed there were moderate to large differences with RMSE% values ranging between 4% and 57%. IMUs are highly accurate at measuring orientation data; however, further work is needed to optimise positioning and modelling approaches so IMU relative angles align more closely with relative angles derived using traditional motion capture methods.","This paper investigates the validity of relative angles derived from inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed on the torso and pelvis in comparison to traditional motion capture methods. Key findings indicate that while IMUs provide accurate orientation data, optimal sensor positioning and modelling approaches are required to enhance the alignment of IMU-derived angles with those from gold standard methods."
Online exercise-based sports injury risk reduction programs—a systematic review protocol,2019-09-12,,,,"Background: Physical activity and sports participation are beneficial for health but also pose an injury risk. Research efforts in sports injury risk reduction are offering more and more solutions; however, implementation seems to be lagging behind. Research results are mainly disseminated through professional journals, which may restrict their accessibility. Therefore, Internet-based resources may be a useful complement, but their availability, content and quality are not yet known.Objectives: To assess the availability, content and quality of sports injury risk reduction exercise-based programs in an online environment.Method: Google, Yahoo and Bing search engines will be used. Two researchers will independently review the retrieved websites for eligibility through an initial and an in-depth screening. Inactive pages or duplicate pages will be excluded. For each retrieved program data on website and program characteristics will be extracted. The JAMA benchmark criteria and HONcode certification will be used to judge the quality of the websites, and the quality of the exercise programs will be assessed via modified CERT.Discussion: In light of implementation delays in sports injury risk reduction practices, there is a need to broaden dissemination strategies to include media such as the Internet. At the same time, there is also a need to assess the quality and content of online-based resources to guide their potential use. The outcomes of this review will inform clinicians, coaches and others of the current availability and content of injury risk reduction exercise-based programs on the Internet.","This paper presents a systematic review protocol aimed at assessing the availability, content, and quality of online exercise-based programs designed to reduce sports injury risk.

The effect of limb preference on braking strategy and knee joint mechanics during pivoting in female soccer players,2019-09-11,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore whether limb preference influences braking strategy and knee joint mechanics during a 180° pivot task in female soccer players.Methods: Three-dimensional motion analyses of pivoting on the preferred and non-preferred kicking limbs were performed using 10 Qualisys ‘Oqus 7ʹ infrared cameras (240 Hz). Ground reaction forces (GRF) were collected from two AMTI force platforms (1200 Hz) embedded into the running track to examine penultimate (PEN) and final (FC) contact.Results: Both preferred and non-preferred limbs involved greater hip (ES = 2.85–3.81) and knee joint flexion angles (ES = 5.74–5.78) and peak vertical GRFs (ES = 0.87–1.61), but lower average vertical (ES = 2.55–3.01) and horizontal GRFs (ES = 3.05–3.67) during the PEN compared to the FC. Knee abduction angles were very likely greater (ES = 0.61) when turning off the non-preferred limb compared to the preferred limb.Conclusion: These findings may help us question the role of limb preference during pivoting, yet knee abduction angles and moments should be monitored with caution in female soccer players. Thus, it remains inconclusive the role limb preference plays in change of direction biomechanics for performance and risk of injury.","This study investigates the impact of limb preference on braking strategy and knee joint mechanics during 180° pivot tasks in female soccer players. The findings indicate that both preferred and non-preferred limbs have distinct knee joint and hip mechanics, highlighting the need for careful monitoring of knee abduction angles and moments during pivoting, while the precise influence of limb preference on change of direction biomechanics remains unclear."
Effects of Post-Activation Potentiation induced by a plyometric protocol on deceleration performance,2019-09-11,,,,"Abstract Post-Activation Potentiation is a phenomenon by which muscular performance characteristics are acutely enhanced as a result of their previous contractile actions. It has been shown how Post-Activation Potentiation, which is usually evoked through heavy resistance exercise, has the potential to improve many different power performances, such as sprinting and jumping. Due to an easier applicability, some studies explored the potential of plyometric muscular actions to evoke the effects of Post-Activation Potentiation. Despite some findings on acceleration running performance, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies investigated the effects of Post-Activation Potentiation on deceleration performance, which is a key factor in sports involving change of directions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a plyometric exercise protocol to a subsequent deceleration running performance. University soccer players (n = 18) performed 7 deceleration trials: at baseline and after ∼ 15 seconds, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 minutes a walking control condition (C) or 3 sets of 10 repetitions of alternate-leg bounding (plyometric, P). Results show that no significant differences were found at any of the trials of the control condition (C) in comparison to the relative baseline. In the plyometric condition (P), the deceleration performance executed 2 minutes after the plyometric activity resulted significantly faster compared to the relative baseline (p = 0.042; ES = 0.86, large effect; % of improvement = 4.13 %). Therefore, the main findings of this study showed that a plyometric exercise has the potential to improve a subsequent running deceleration performance in soccer players, if an adequate recovery between these activities is provided to the players. These findings encourage further future investigations about the possible potentiating effects of plyometric activities on more complex actions like changes of direction and agility.","The paper investigates the effects of a plyometric exercise protocol on deceleration performance in soccer players, focusing on the phenomenon of Post-Activation Potentiation. The results indicate that performing plyometric exercises can significantly enhance deceleration performance shortly after the activity, suggesting implications for training practices in sports involving rapid directional changes."
The relationship between sprint speed and sprint motion in amputee soccer players,2019-09-07,,,,"Sprint performance plays an important role in amputee soccer.Sprint motion such as step length and frequency are generally accepted as one of the determining factors of sprint performance.However, there is a paucity of sprint motion studies.Here we sought to analyze sprint motion in outfield positioned amputee soccer players using crutches and to clarify the relationship between sprint speed and sprint motion.Twelve male Japanese outfield players participated; they performed a 30-m sprint with maximum effort.Sprint times and speeds were recorded using electronic timing gates.A high-speed video camera recorded sprint motion.The time and distance of each crutch and step were determined via image analysis.Sprint speed was significantly positively correlated with body mass (r=0.692,p=0.013), length and frequency of one running cycle(r=0.817,p=0.001; r=0.666, p=0.018, respectively), 1st-2nd step length (r=0.890,p=0.001), and crutch-1st step length (r=0.659,p=0.020).In addition, sprint speed was significantly negatively correlated with time taken for each 10-m interval as well as with contact time of first foot (r=-0.881,p=0.001) and crutch stance time (r=-0.670,p=0.017).Our results suggest that improving sprint speed requires increasing the step length within a shorter time frame in first foot step and crutch stance.","This paper analyzes the relationship between sprint speed and sprint motion in amputee soccer players using crutches. It finds that sprint speed is positively correlated with body mass and various measures of running cycle length and frequency, while indicating that sprint speed can be improved by enhancing step length and reducing the time taken during initial foot contact and crutch stance."
The Effect of Training Interventions on Change of Direction Biomechanics Associated with Increased Anterior Cruciate Ligament Loading: A Scoping Review,2019-09-06,,,,"Change of direction (COD) manoeuvres are associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk due to the propensity to generate large multiplanar knee joint loads. Given the short- and long-term consequences of ACL injury, practitioners are interested in methods that reduce knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading. An effective strategy to reduce ACL loading is modifying an athlete's movement mechanics to reduce knee joint loading. The purpose of this scoping review was to critically appraise and comprehensively synthesise the existing literature related to the effects of training interventions on COD biomechanics associated with increased knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading, and identify gaps and recommend areas for future research. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and Sport DISCUS databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of pre-post analysis of a COD task, a minimum 4-week training intervention, and assessments of biomechanical characteristics associated with increased ACL loading. Of the 1,027 articles identified, 22 were included in the scoping review. Based on current literature, balance training and COD technique modification are the most effective training modalities for reducing knee joint loading (small to moderate effect sizes). One study reported dynamic core stability training was effective in reducing knee joint loads, but further research is needed to definitively confirm the efficacy of this method. Perturbation-enhanced plyometric training, the F-MARC 11 + soccer specific warm-up, Oslo Neuromuscular warm-up, and resistance training are ineffective training modalities to reduce COD knee joint loads. Conflicting findings have been observed for the Core-Pac and mixed training programme. Consequently, practitioners should consider incorporating balance and COD technique modification drills into their athletes' training programmes to reduce potentially hazardous knee joint loads when changing direction. However, training intervention studies can be improved by investigating larger sample sizes (> 20), including a control group, acknowledging measurement error when interpreting their findings, and considering performance implications, to confirm the effectiveness of training interventions and improve adherence.","This scoping review examines the impact of training interventions on change of direction (COD) biomechanics and their association with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) loading in sports. The findings suggest that balance training and COD technique modifications significantly reduce knee joint loading, while other training modalities show limited effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust research on training interventions."
The Effects of Six-Weeks Change of Direction Speed and Technique Modification Training on Cutting Performance and Movement Quality in Male Youth Soccer Players,2019-09-06,,,,"Cutting manoeuvres are important actions associated with soccer performance and a key action associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury; thus, training interventions that can improve cutting performance and movement quality are of great interest. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effects of a six-week change of dire[ction (COD) speed and technique modification training intervention on cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players (U17s, n = 8) in comparison to a control group (CG) (U18s, n = 11) who continued 'normal' training. Cutting performance was assessed based on completion time and COD deficit, and the field-based cutting movement assessment score (CMAS) qualitative screening tool was used to assess cutting movement quality. Significant main effects for time (pre-to-post changes) (p ≤ 0.041, η2 = 0.224-0.839) and significant interaction effects of time and group were observed for cutting completion times, COD deficits, and CMASs. Improvements in completion time (p < 0.001, g = 1.63-1.90, -9% to -11% vs. -5% to 6%) and COD deficit (p ≤ 0.012, g = -1.63 to -2.43, -40-52% vs. -22% to -28%) for the COD intervention group (IG) were approximately two-times greater than the CG. Furthermore, lower CMASs (i.e., improved cutting movement quality) were only observed in the IG (p ≤ 0.025, g = -0.85 to -1.46, -23% to -34% vs. 6-19%) compared to the CG. The positive changes in CMASs were attributed to improved cutting technique and reduced incidences of high-risk deficits such as lateral trunk flexion, extended knee postures, knee valgus, hip internal rotation, and improved braking strategies. The results of this study indicate that COD speed and technique modification training, in addition to normal skills and strength training, improves cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players. Practitioners working with male youth soccer players should implement COD speed and technique modification training to improve cutting performance and movement quality, which may decrease potential injury-risk.","This paper investigates the impact of a six-week change of direction speed and technique modification training on cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players. The study finds significant improvements in cutting completion times, change of direction deficits, and movement quality in the intervention group compared to a control group, indicating that targeted training can enhance performance and potentially reduce injury risk."
Investigation on Soccer Referees: A Narrative Review,2019-09-01,,,,"Abstract Introduction. The heightened physical exertion stemming from greater physical loads in football matches has elicited greater development of physical conditioning in both players and referees. Material and methods. The current study consisted of a meta-analysis geared towards identifying the scientific data currently available on the training of referees. Results. With respect to the characterization of the training of football referees, the results of this study showed that there is a diversity of both its methods and contents. As a result of this and based on the support offered by the meta-analysis, a proposal for categorizing the contents of this training is presented. Testing-wise, the results also showed that the FIFA test fails to identify the varying intensities that occur within a match setting and to characterize the distribution of referees’ varying exertions throughout match settings. Lastly, the results of this study also indicated that the training of referees ought to include periodization guidelines over the course of a season, since doing so allows for the optimization and monitoring of referees’ performance.","This paper provides a narrative review on the training and physical conditioning of football referees, highlighting the diverse methods and content of their training programs.

Influence of Cleat Design on Knee Joint Moments During Cutting Maneuver and Instep Kick in Soccer,2019-09-01,,,,"Background.This study aimed to compare the influence of different cleat designs on specific soccer movements.Methods.The sample consisted of 10 recreational players who performed cutting and kicking movements using soccer shoes with three different cleat shapes: C1 (Circular), C2 (Rectangular) and C3 (Mixed).Kinematic data were collected using the Vicon system and an AMTI force platform.The moments were calculated by the Nexus System and the peaks extracted in Matlab at every 10% of the stance phase.Repeated measures ANOVA and the Bonferroni post-hoc test were conducted at α<0.05 for statistical analysis.Results.C1 exhibited a higher external rotation moment (P<0.05) at the onset of the stance phase than C2 and C3.In the kicking movement, C3 showed a higher valgus moment (P<0.05)than C2 and C1 in the first 10% of stance.C3 also obtained a higher internal rotation moment (P<005) at 60% of stance.Conclusions.These results suggest that C1 may offer greater stability at the onset of the stance phase.In kicking, the different physical traits of C3 allow faster transition and deeper soil penetration.Soccer cleats influence the knee joint moment during cutting movements and kicking.These results are important form to reduce the risk of injury.","This study investigates the impact of different soccer cleat designs on knee joint moments during cutting and kicking actions in soccer players. The results indicate that specific cleat shapes significantly affect knee stability and movement mechanics, highlighting the importance of cleat design in potentially reducing injury risk."
The Effect of Soccer Ball Impulse on Lower Limbs of the Human Body,2019-09-01,,,,"Despite the fact that soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, little attention has been paid to this game scientifically which could otherwise provide a broad range of interesting outcomes. Sport equipment has a significant effect on how a game is played. Different features of the soccer ball such as its size, structure, weight and potential incoming pressure also affect the nature and quality of the game. Different models of soccer balls have been developed with the aim of increasing game quality and performance. Many scholars have investigated the displacements during typical soccer games caused by the ball impulse and the feet, but few studies have focused on the interaction between the ball and the feet. The aim of the present study is, thus, to investigate tension development and possible deformations caused by kicking the ball. Players who are well aware of soccer rules and have a little knowledge about soccer-induced injuries easily realize that the impulse of a non-standard ball considering its material, size or weight may severely damage the knees or other body parts. Due to the importance of the issue, to evaluate the impact of the soccer ball on the footballer’s feet, two finite element models of typical soccer balls have been studied with respect to the standard features of the real soccer ball in the three layers of leather, thread and rubber. The first model is proportional to the mass of the standard ball and the second incorporates a mass less than the standard level. Two models of bones are used in the present study: a single layer bone and a two-layer bone with cortical and cancellous tissues. For better understanding of the injuries resulting from the impulse from a non-standard ball, the used finite element software employs mechanic laws of sport biomechanics to provide better understanding of the details using mathematical modeling, computer simulation and experimental measurements. In this regard, this significant point is achieved through modeling the ball impulse to the feet which is quite complex and needs some simplification. As the soccer ball is flexible, most of the force is absorbed by the model’s flexibility. In the other model with a less flexible ball, the force absorbed by the bone is significantly more.","This study investigates the impact of soccer ball impulse on lower limbs, specifically focusing on the tension development and potential injuries caused by kicking. Utilizing finite element models, the research compares standard and non-standard soccer balls to understand how variations in ball features can affect players' feet and overall injury risk."
Effects of autologous adipose-derived regenerative stem cells administered at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on knee function and graft healing,2019-08-30,,,,"Purpose: To compare the healing and clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction between patients with or without intraoperative administration of adipose-derived regenerative stem cells (ADRC). Methods: Between 2013 and 2014, the outcomes of 20 soccer players undergoing ACL reconstruction using bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft infiltrated with ADRC at the end of the procedure were compared to a historical, matched cohort of 19 soccer players undergoing the same procedure without ADRC. Outcomes were obtained at baseline, and 6 and 12 months postop for IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee), Lysholm, and Lequesne, and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months postop for VAS (visual analogue scale) for pain and graft maturation to evaluate the ligamentization process (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based). Results: Both groups significantly improved the IKDC ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups), Lysholm ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups), Lequesne index ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups), VAS for pain ( p = 0.002 for the ADRC and p &lt; 0.001 for the control group), and MRI scores ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups) in the 12 months postop compared to baseline scores. However, there were no significant differences in the improvement of the outcomes between groups across time ( p &gt; 0.05). All patients returned to sports after surgery, but 8 (40%) patients in the ADRC and 13 (68.4%) patients in the control group had lower Tegner activity score at 12 months postop. Conclusions: Patients receiving ADRC at the time of ACL reconstruction significantly improved knee function and healing/maturation of the graft at 12 months. However, this improvement was not statistically significant compared to a control group undergoing ACL reconstruction alone.","The paper investigates the effects of administering autologous adipose-derived regenerative stem cells (ADRC) during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on knee function and graft healing in soccer players. While both groups displayed significant improvements in knee function and graft maturation at 12 months post-operation, no statistically significant differences were found between the ADRC group and the control group."
Physical Performance Measures Correlate with Head Impact Exposure in Youth Football,2019-08-30,,,,"ABSTRACT Purpose Head impact exposure (HIE) (i.e., magnitude and frequency of impacts) can vary considerably among individuals within a single football team. To better understand individual-specific factors that may explain variation in head impact biomechanics, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between physical performance measures and HIE metrics in youth football players. Methods Head impact data were collected from youth football players using the Head Impact Telemetry System. Head impact exposure was quantified in terms of impact frequency, linear and rotational head acceleration, and risk-weighted cumulative exposure metrics (RWE Linear , RWE Rotational , and RWE CP ). Study participants completed four physical performance tests: vertical jump, shuttle run, three-cone, and 40-yard sprint. The relationships between performance measures, and HIE metrics were evaluated using linear regression analyses. Results A total of 51 youth football athletes (ages, 9–13 yr) completed performance testing and received combined 13,770 head impacts measured with the Head Impact Telemetry System for a full season. All performance measures were significantly correlated with total number of impacts in a season, RWE Linear -Season, and all RWE-Game metrics. The strongest relationships were between 40-yard sprint speed and all RWE-Game metrics (all P ≤ 0.0001 and partial R 2 &gt; 0.3). The only significant relationships among HIE metrics in practice were between shuttle run speed and total practice impacts and RWE Linear -Practices, 40 yard sprint speed and total number of practice impacts, and three-cone speed and 95th percentile number of impacts/practice. Conclusions Generally, higher vertical jump height and faster times in speed and agility drills were associated with higher HIE, especially in games. Physical performance explained less variation in HIE in practices, where drills and other factors, such as coaching style, may have a larger influence on HIE.","This paper investigates the correlation between physical performance measures and head impact exposure (HIE) in youth football players, specifically assessing how individual performance impacts head impact metrics. The findings indicate that overall physical performance, particularly sprint speed and vertical jump height, is significantly associated with increased head impact exposure during games, while practice environments show different influencing factors."
Soccer-related head injuries—analysis of sentinel surveillance data collected by the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program,2019-08-30,,,,"Participating in sports is a great way to gain physical, psychological, and social benefits. However, it also carries the risk of injury. Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide, and in recent years, there have been concerns about potential vulnerabilities to head injuries.To investigate soccer-related head injuries (SRHIs), using data from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) surveillance system. Specifically, we aim to compare characteristics of SRHI cases to all head injury cases within the eCHIRPP database.Descriptive analyses of emergency department (ED) injury surveillance data (2011 to 2017) for individuals aged 5 to 29 years from all participating eCHIRPP sites. Computation of proportionate injury ratios (PIR) comparing SRHIs to all head injuries reported to eCHIRPP, and 95% confidence intervals (CI).A total of 3,970 SRHIs were reported to eCHIRPP. Injuries were from contact with another player, the ball, ground, goal-post, and other causes. Of the injuries caused by contact with the ball, 9% were from purposely directing the ball with the head (heading). A higher proportion of concussions (PIR=1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27 to 1.37) and minor closed head injuries (PIR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.26) were observed in soccer players. Higher proportions of head injuries occurred in organized soccer and soccer played outdoors. However, admission to the ED for a SRHI was rare (PIR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.55).Overall, elevated proportions of brain injuries were observed among soccer players, however, these injuries were unlikely to result in a hospital admission. Moreover, purposely heading the ball contributed to few ED visits.","This paper investigates soccer-related head injuries (SRHIs) using data from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP), specifically comparing characteristics of SRHI cases to all head injury cases within the database. Key findings reveal a higher proportion of concussions and minor closed head injuries among soccer players, with heading the ball contributing minimally to emergency department visits."
"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Research Retreat VIII Summary Statement: An Update on Injury Risk Identification and Prevention Across the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Continuum, March 14–16, 2019, Greensboro, NC",2019-08-28,,,,"The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Research Retreat VIII was held March 14–16, 2019, in Greensboro, North Carolina. The retreat brought together clinicians and researchers to present and discuss research advances in ACL injury risk, outcomes, and prevention. Prior retreats (2001–2012)1–6 largely focused on advances in primary injury risk-factor identification and prevention (ie, preventing the initial trauma). Despite our improved understanding of ACL injury risk and the success of primary prevention efforts, ACL injuries continue to occur and lead to short-term and long-term consequences that have substantial effects on joint health and quality of life for years to come. To address these additional challenges, the ACL Research Retreat expanded in scope to include secondary ACL injury risk and prevention in 20157 and the short-term and long-term sequelae of early-onset osteoarthritis that results from the initial trauma (herein, posttraumatic osteoarthritis or PTOA) in 2019. The ACL Research Retreat VIII therefore considered ACL injury risk and prevention along a continuum that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary risk identification and prevention strategies as described by Palmieri-Smith et al (Table 1).8To illustrate this continuum, consider a soccer team comprising 13-year-old girls. We know the ACL injury risk increases dramatically from ages 13 to 16,9–11 such that girls have a 2 to 4 times greater risk than similarly trained males.12,13 Thus, our first goal for this age group, especially among maturing girls, is to prevent the initial trauma from occurring (ie, primary prevention). We pursue injury risk reduction by leveraging 2½ decades of research to screen for known risk factors and deliver evidence-based neuromuscular-training programs to reduce the ACL injury risk. Despite these interventions, 1 or more of these active, young girls may still go on to sustain an ACL injury, which has both short-term and long-term secondary consequences. In the short term (first year after injury), we know that 50% of injured athletes do not return to their prior levels of sport.14 Of the young athletic patients who do return to high-risk sport, nearly 1 in 4 will sustain another ACL injury, often within the first few months of their return.15–19 Therefore, once an injury has occurred, our goals are to deliver therapeutic interventions to optimally restore joint function and reduce that individual's potential for experiencing a second ACL injury while at the same time preventing further joint damage (ie, secondary prevention). This includes intervening in both the primary risk factors that contributed to the initial injury (assuming they are still present) and the neuromechanical deficits that resulted from the injury. This also includes establishing evidence-based biopsychosocial benchmarks to safely return the athlete to sport. Still, more than 30% of these athletes have been reported20 to develop early evidence of PTOA within 10 years of the initial injury, which has the potential to significantly alter joint function and quality of life. Long-term prevention strategies are therefore geared at identifying the factors that hasten the development and progression of PTOA and developing appropriate therapeutic interventions to delay or mitigate these complications (ie, tertiary prevention).The ACL Research Retreat VIII featured 3 keynote presentations and 32 peer-reviewed abstract presentations highlighting advances in risk identification and prevention strategies across the ACL injury continuum. Keynote speakers presented cutting-edge research on ACL injury biomechanics and the motions that elevate in vivo ACL strains during dynamic activities that place individuals at high risk for ACL injury (Louis DeFrate, ScD, Duke University, Durham, NC), innovative augmented neuromuscular-training approaches to more effectively reduce the biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury (Gregory Myer, PhD, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH), and the identification of early markers of PTOA and directions for therapeutic interventions to prevent joint degeneration and promote joint rejuvenation earlier in the clinical course after ACL injury (Constance Chu, MD, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, CA). Free communication sessions were organized around the themes of primary risk identification (ACL morphology and brain contributions) and intervention strategies, secondary risk identification and prevention (neuromechanical deficiencies and return-to-play considerations after ACL reconstruction [ACLR]), and tertiary risk identification and prevention (chronic sequelae of PTOA progression). Substantial time was provided for group discussion to summarize the recent advances and emerging trends from each thematic session and identify strategic initiatives for future research. We then considered risk factors that were common targets across primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts and the potential for developing a collaborative, multicenter ACL injury research network that could span the time course of ACL injury from primary injury prevention to the secondary and tertiary prevention of PTOA after injury. The summary of these discussions follows. We also present the summaries21,22 of 2 keynotes and the research abstracts23 on which these discussions were based. (Note: As Dr DeFrate's keynote focused primarily on recently completed yet unpublished data, a written summary is not included. Please watch for forthcoming publications from his work.)It is widely accepted that multifactorial mechanisms contribute to the risk of primary ACL injury. Much of the discussion during the meeting centered on the concept that at-risk biomechanics known to strain the ACL could be considered an intersection of overlapping contributions from anatomic/structural, biological, neurologic, and psychosocial factors. These at-risk biomechanics have been correlated with joint actions ascertained from modeled and direct ACL-loading biomechanics,24–32 video observation of actual injury events,33–36 and prospective ACL injury risk-factor studies.37,38 The mechanistic studies presented by Dr DeFrate indicated that a relatively extended knee at foot contact may be a high-risk position due to the relatively larger ACL strain values in this position.39–41Research on primary risk assessment presented at the ACL Research Retreat VIII focused on structural and neurologic risk factors. This summary is therefore limited to those areas. The reader is referred to the 2015 ACL Research Retreat VII consensus statement7 for an in-depth discussion of risk assessment, as much of the important knowns and directions for future research remain relevant today.Greater anterior knee laxity42–51 and greater body mass index (BMI)11,49,51–53 are well-documented risk factors that are substantially more predictive of ACL injury risk when both are accounted for relative to a univariate modeling of risk.49,51 Females develop greater anterior knee laxity54–56 and BMI (representing more fat mass relative to total body mass)57–60 as they mature, and these maturational changes coincide with their disproportional rise in ACL injury risk compared with males.9,11,61 At the last retreat,7 it was suggested that greater magnitudes of knee laxity may have both biological and biomechanical consequences. Research presented there indicated that clinical measures of anterior knee laxity may provide insights into the structural size and quality of the ACL (Wang et al abstract #1, Shultz et al abstract #2).23 Greater absolute anterior knee laxity was related to the in vivo combination of smaller ligament size and intrinsic structural characteristics (larger T2* relaxation times) of the ligament (Wang et al abstract #1). When examining the magnitude of change in knee laxity across the menstrual cycle and during exercise (which were strongly correlated), investigators found that smaller and less organized ACLs (larger T2* relaxation times) were associated with a smaller magnitude of change in laxity and a smaller magnitude of change tended to be associated with a greater baseline value (Shultz et al abstract #2).Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxation mapping has been primarily validated for articular cartilage tissue.62–64 In addition to the research presented at ACL Research Retreat VIII, including the use of novel MRI ultrashort echo time T2* to evaluate healing ACL grafts,21,65 T2* relaxation has been used to study animal ACL grafts66,67 and has been negatively associated with the yield load of healing ACL grafts.66 Additionally, these imaging sequences have been used to evaluate the structural characteristics of the Achilles68 and patellar69 tendons. The ability to noninvasively assess ligamentous structural characteristics via a clinical measure such as knee laxity may help us to better understand and identify the risk of injury in clinical settings.Further insights into BMI as a primary risk factor were not discussed. However, BMI was addressed relative to secondary prevention and the development of PTOA (see later sections).Central neurologic factors represent a rapidly emerging area of ACL injury risk assessment. Adding to published work,70–77 data presented at the retreat further suggest neurophysiological contributions to ACL injury (Diekfuss et al abstract #5, Bonnette et al abstract #6) and recovery (Lepley et al abstract #14); however, our understanding of both areas remains limited. As discussed at ACL Research Retreat VII by Buz Swanik, PhD, ATC,77 a noncontact ACL injury event can be conceptualized as a sequence of neural-activity errors that results in an inability to maintain joint stability. Neuroimaging studies presented at ACL Research Retreat VIII further indicate a potentially direct association between alterations in neural activity or connectivity and high-risk biomechanics and ACL injury risk (or a combination of these). Specifically, individuals classified as high risk (≥21.74-Nm knee-abduction moment [KAM]) versus low risk (≤10.6-Nm KAM) during 3-dimensional motion analysis of a double-legged landing displayed increased sensorimotor neural activity during neuroimaging of a simulated landing (similar hip and knee ranges of motion as in the laboratory-based landing but supine in the MRI scanner; Criss et al abstract #3). Additionally, high-risk individuals exhibited decreased neural activity in the cingulate gyrus (attention) and parietal cortex (sensory processing) during a single-legged knee-repositioning task and increased brain activity of the frontal cortex (cognition) during a single-legged knee force-attenuation task (Grooms et al abstract #4). These alterations in activity suggest a manifestation of maladapted spatial awareness and attention to knee motor control that may contribute to a decreased ability to control frontal-plane loading during landing. Decreased activity in the sensory and attentional regions and increased activity in the cognitive and motor regions to control knee-joint position and force during a simulated landing task in those at high risk for injury may indicate a rapid saturation of motor-coordination capacity. Specifically, dynamic maneuvers with high environmental-navigation or spatial-processing demands may lead to a deterioration in neuromuscular coordination that results in high KAMs.Prospective neuroimaging risk factors were also presented at the retreat. Among female athletes compared with control participants, individuals who went on to experience an ACL injury exhibited less electroencephalography (EEG) power in the θ and α-2 frequency bands, findings that are thought to be associated with decreased attentional and sensorimotor electrocortical functioning (Bonnette et al abstract #6). As the ACL injury typically occurs from rapid and high loading forces, any deficit or delay in sensory or attentional processing may contribute to an inability to correct potential sensorimotor-coordination errors, resulting in knee positions that increase the ACL injury risk.78 Also, in male athletes, using baseline resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), individuals who went on to sustain an ACL injury displayed decreased connectivity between multiple sensorimotor regions compared with uninjured control participants (Diekfuss et al abstract #5). Together, these findings indicate that the underlying neural processes related to sensorimotor control may play a role in ACL injury risk and that the neural contributions to injury risk may be sex dependent.Collectively, this emerging area of research implicates a cognitive-motor as opposed to a sensory-motor neural-activation strategy in those with an elevated injury risk. More research is needed to determine if these processes contribute to an inability to manage unanticipated events or visual-spatial challenges and subsequently generate sufficient muscle stiffening to avoid injury.Several high-quality meta-analyses89–94 indicated that the ACL injury incidence was reduced with neuromuscular-training programs. In female athletes, these programs resulted in a decrease of half of all ACL injuries and two-thirds of noncontact ACL injuries.90 Successful programs incorporated progressive landing-stabilization exercises that focus on proper knee alignment and soft landings in addition to exercises targeting the hip and hamstrings musculature. Neuromuscular-training programs implemented before the sport season and continued through the season appeared to be more effective in reducing the risk of ACL injury. Additionally, these programs should be implemented early in middle school– and high school–aged athletes.89The structured discussion at the ACL Research Retreat VIII highlighted the current state of knowledge about the success of neuromuscular-training programs and the use of promising new technologies (eg, virtual and augmented reality, real-time biofeedback, and wearable sensors).95,96 The consensus was that externally focused biofeedback techniques, which engage implicit motor-learning mechanisms, are advantageous for sensorimotor adaptation.97–101 MacPherson et al (abstract #19) presented preliminary data on the effects of delivering augmented biofeedback to female athletes. This intervention not only demonstrated increased sensorimotor-related brain activation for knee motor control (using fMRI) but the observed neural adaptations were also strongly correlated with safer landing biomechanics assessed using 3-dimensional motion analyses. Additionally, preliminary data on augmented biofeedback indicated that it may induce adaptive neuroplasticity, thereby increasing the retention and transfer of those movement patterns to sport.102 These early data highlight the utility of real-time biofeedback systems for sensorimotor adaptation that could eventually be personalized to target individual movement deficiencies. The previous consensus statement7 highlighted the need for future work in this area, and several National Institutes of Health–funded randomized controlled trials95,96 currently being performed will likely inform future programs.The majority of individuals who sustain an ACL injury and undergo ACLR and traditional rehabilitation return to some level of physical activity.107 However, as previously noted, 50% of those who tear their ACLs do not return to their prior competitive level of sport.14 Of the young athletes (<25 years old) who do return to sport, 1 in 4 are likely to experience a second ACL injury,19 and many of these injuries occur within 24 months of returning to sport.108–110 The risk of secondary injury is of particular concern for adolescent girls, who are 2 to 4 times more likely than adolescent boys or older age groups to sustain a second ACL injury15–18 and subsequently experience poorer health outcomes.111,112 Thus, secondary prevention efforts are critically needed.Even more debilitating than the ACL injury itself are the initiation and accelerated rate of progression of PTOA that are frequently observed after injury,20,113 which further compound patient-reported disability and reduced performance in activities of daily living.114 Among young and physically active populations, roughly 50% of ACL injuries progress to radiographic PTOA within 12 years; similar findings have been reported for meniscal tears.115,116 Effective surgical interventions are available to repair these injuries and restore short-term function and mobility to preinjury performance levels, but surgical repair does not prevent the early development and rapid progression of PTOA in the knee joint.117 Furthermore, significant deficits in patient-reported outcomes,118 neuromuscular function,119 biomechanical movement patterns,120 and psychosocial factors121,122 have been noted even after patients have undergone ACLR and completed a full course of therapy.A new focus at ACL Research Retreat VIII was on how ACL injury affects short-term and long-term joint health, with the goal of mitigating the risk of secondary injury and PTOA. Traditionally, the management of ACL injuries has ended when athletes are deemed fit to return to participation. Treatment has focused on restoring anatomic structures and initial functional capabilities through surgical repair and rehabilitation; patients with uncomplicated courses are typically discharged from follow-up care 6 to 9 months after surgery. However, it is clear from previous evidence that these traditional approaches to ACLR surgery, rehabilitation, and return to play do not adequately reduce the risk of subsequent injury109,123 or the development of PTOA.20 Therefore, ACL injuries are the starting point for impaired joint function and a cascade of progressive degenerative joint changes in the knee that lead to altered function and chronic pain and result in physical limitations affecting both performance and activities of daily living.8,124 The interplay among biomechanical, structural, neuromuscular, and biological changes after ACL injury and surgical reconstruction likely contributes to the development of PTOA.125 Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the development of persistent symptoms, impaired joint function, and biochemical changes within the joint is paramount to identifying novel therapeutic targets to improve short-term and long-term patient outcomes after ACLR.The ACL Research Retreat VIII featured abstract presentations that highlighted a multifaceted range of factors that alter neuromuscular function, joint-loading patterns, and movement biomechanics after ACLR, including ACL grafting techniques.The quadriceps tendon is an increasingly popular autograft type that showed similar interlimb symmetry in loading during jump landing as the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (Hunnicutt et al abstract #8). It also displayed similar interlimb symmetry as the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in quadriceps strength, size, and activation, as well as hop distance and patient-reported outcomes.126 However, biomechanical modeling work (Domire et al abstract #7) suggested that alterations in the semitendinosus attachment site after the tendon was used for an ACL graft may result in alterations to the moment arm of the semitendinosus. This raises the question of whether some of the differences observed in movement mechanics after ACLR result from the change in moment arm of the lower extremity muscles as a result of the surgical reconstruction.The inability to contract the quadriceps is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism linking ACL injury and ACLR to aberrant movement biomechanics after injury and surgery,119 which may increase the risk of a second ACL injury or the development of PTOA. Quadriceps weakness in individuals who have undergone ACLR is associated with worse patient-reported function127,128 as well as deleterious changes in joint structure and129 cartilage composition.130Extensive discussion at the retreat addressed the neural and morphologic mechanisms associated with muscular changes after ACL injury and ACLR. A neural-morphologic link between changes in spinal reflexive and cortical excitability and changes in muscle structure together influenced persistent muscle weakness after ACLR (Lepley et al abstract #14). In addition to reduced muscle volume, novel diffusion tensor MRI methods demonstrated an increased muscle-fiber angle in the vastus medialis after ACLR compared with the uninjured limb (Lepley et al abstract #13). Other, more clinically applicable imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography, were also used to assess altered muscle quality after ACLR (Johnston et al abstract #17). We still poorly understand the factors associated with optimal treatments to reverse the multifaceted neuromuscular sequelae of ACL injury and ACLR. Also, whether strengthening the quadriceps results in beneficial changes to movement biomechanics remains uncertain. Although quadriceps weakness may result in immediate changes in gait,131 improving quadriceps strength does not necessarily alter gait biomechanics in patients after ACLR132 or with knee osteoarthritis (OA).133,134 This was further supported by Krysak et al (abstract #18), who found that a plyometric intervention improved quadriceps strength limb symmetry without subsequent changes in hop movement among individuals after ACLR. In addition, these results showed that integrative motor-learning and muscle-strengthening approaches are warranted to restore holistic sensorimotor capabilities after injury.Aberrant lower extremity joint loading is commonly observed after ACLR.135 Evidence suggested that either excessive136 or insufficient loading137,138 of joint tissues may lead to joint injury or hasten the progression of PTOA. Greater loading of the ACLR limb has been demonstrated during gait compared with the contralateral limb139 and the limbs of uninjured control participants.140 Conversely, others have observed less loading of the ACLR limb during gait, and this reduced loading was associated with greater biochemical markers of inflammation141 and cartilage breakdown,142 altered cartilage composition,143 worse patient-reported outcomes,144 thinner tibiofemoral cartilage,145 and radiographic knee OA 5 years after ACLR.146 The mechanisms leading to abnormal amounts of more or less loading during gait after ACLR are not clear, but data presented at the retreat helped to shed light on potential mechanisms and stimulate directions for future research.Preliminary data provided at the retreat demonstrated an association between greater femoral articular cartilage T1ρ MRI relaxation times (ie, interpreted as worse proteoglycan density) and greater peak vertical ground reaction force as well as smaller quadriceps-related knee moments in individuals with ACLR during a jump landing (Pfeiffer et al abstract #30). These data support the hypothesis that excessive tibiofemoral loading may be minimized after ACLR in individuals who maximize quadriceps-related moments during dynamic movements. Other investigators found that poorer proprioception was associated with less loading during gait, suggesting that offloading of the ACLR limb may be correlated with altered somatosensory function in the lower extremity (Blackburn et al abstract #29). These seemingly conflicting findings may point to complex associations among muscle function, joint loading, and deleterious joint tissue changes after ACLR. Not understanding this interplay was considered a major gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms causing PTOA after ACLR. Unfortunately, this critical knowledge gap impairs the development of optimal evidence-based load-management guidelines for maximizing long-term joint health after ACLR.Aberrant walking-gait biomechanics are common in individuals with ACLR135,147,148 and are likely to be highly influential in PTOA development.149 A stiffened-knee strategy, characterized by a more extended knee and a smaller quadriceps-related moment through stance, is common after ACLR and may result in impaired energy attenuation in tissues about the knee.150,151 Preliminary evidence from the retreat showed that individuals with weaker quadriceps (ie, <3.0 Nm/kg of body mass) displayed more extended knees throughout stance and smaller moments and greater vertical ground reaction force in the first 20% of stance than individuals who met strength cutoffs (ie, >3.0 Nm/kg of body mass; Pietrosimone et al abstract #11). Minimizing strength loss after ACL injury and ACLR was associated with gait strategies that may mitigate the risk of PTOA development.Additionally, individuals with a greater BMI demonstrated differences in gait biomechanics compared with those who had a normal BMI.152 Greater BMI (associated with greater fat mass relative to total body mass) and obesity have been strongly implicated in the risk of primary ACL injury11,49,51,52 and the development of OA.153 Individuals with ACLR who were overweight or obese had greater peak knee-adduction moments and vertical ground reaction force (normalized to total body mass) than uninjured individuals who were overweight or obese (Pamukoff et al abstract #10). The influence of obesity on gait biomechanics may be further affected by sex (Davis-Wilson abstract #9).Functional assessments were discussed as critical components for improving return-to-play decision making after ACLR. New data indicated that individuals who achieved 90% interlimb symmetry during a triple-hop-for-distance test exhibited asymmetric lower extremity joint work and power outcomes, suggesting that movement strategies to achieve symmetric hop distances may differ between limbs (White et al abstract #26). Further data are needed to determine if asymmetric movement strategies in the presence of symmetric hop distances influence the risk of reinjury on return to sport.Current return-to-participation or return-to-sport criteria have focused on minimizing the risk of subsequent ACL injury,154 yet previously published criteria did not specifically address the risk of PTOA development. We need to collect patient-reported outcomes after ACLR to identify individuals who may need additional psychological support. Specifically, individuals with ACLR who reported greater fear of reinjury also described greater physical and psychological barriers to returning to sport (Burland et al abstract #24). Additionally, a novel case study integrated the measurement of movement quality and monitoring of external load in an adolescent female soccer player (Taylor et al abstract #25). The authors highlighted the clinical feasibility of measuring both the quality and quantity of movement to make more informed clinical decisions regarding whether athletes are ready to meet the demands of sport. Fluid biochemical analyses (Trump et al abstract #32) and MRI markers of cartilage morphology and composition155 may allow the early detection of deleterious changes to joint tissues. However, these techniques are expensive, technically demanding, generally investigational, and inaccessible to many clinicians. Measures such as habitual walking speed,156,157 quadriceps strength (normalized to total body mass),128 and patient-reported outcomes158 show promise as clinically relevant measures associated with early changes in joint tissue health after ACLR.Mounting evidence suggests that the progression to PTOA is influenced by the interplay between aberrant joint biomechanics and altered joint tissue metabolism after injury.126,159–162 Work reflecting more than a decade of longitudinal study21,163 of ACL-injured patients at the University of Pittsburgh and Stanford University presented by keynote speaker Constance Chu, MD, showed that approximately half of patients had quantitative MRI ultrashort echo time-T2*, mechanical, or biological markers indicating a higher OA risk just 2 years after ACLR. Several researchers sought to characterize the effects of early structural, biomechanical, and biological changes after ACL injury and their association with important outcomes related to joint health status over time (Blackburn abstract #29, Pfeiffer abstract #30, Wallace abstract #31, and Trump abstract #32). Characterizing how these changes are related to long-term joint health status and outcomes is of critical importance to the secondary and tertiary prevention of PTOA after ACL injury and may facilitate emerging models of care that are focused on preserving joint health and mitigating the risk of PTOA.8,164,165Historically, our understanding of neuromuscular function after ACLR has been limited to gross measures of quadriceps strength recovery, neglecting the intricate relationships between the neural and morphologic environments that interact to produce force and maintain muscle health. However, recent advances in technologies, such as fMRI for neural activity and improved MRI for quantifying muscle quality and cartilage health, have been successfully implemented and led to key observations about poor long-term neuromuscular recoveries that degrade joint health. From a neural perspective, we have seen that those with ACL injury displayed increased cognitive and visuospatial proprioception-related neural activity and altered cortical motor excitability throughout recovery.74–76 This altered neurocognitive scheme directly impairs sensorimotor neural efficiency, which in turn degrades physical function and performance.77,102,166 New data presented at the retreat focused on muscle health and neuromuscular control; these continue to be dysregulated long after the traditional ACLR rehabilitation period has ended. Notably, these studies provided evidence for markers of greater muscle fat accumulation after ACLR in concert with a fibrotic extracellular matrix (Johnston et al abstract #17), altered muscle phenotyping (Lepley et al abstract #14), changes in muscle-fiber angle (Lepley et al abstract #13), and dynamic muscle function (Davi et al abstract #16). From a biomechanical viewpoint, a hazardous link between neuromuscular-control strategies and long-term joint health was reported, whereby inadequate knee somatosensory recovery during gait (Blackburn et al abstract #29) and altered interlimb jump-landing strategies (Pfeiffer et al abstract #30) after ACLR were linked with factors associated with PTOA risk. To date, our observations of these disruptions in neural efficiency, protracted morphologic abnormalities, and biomechanical dysfunction are limited to cross-sectional studies and small-scale preoperative-to-postoperative ACLR cohorts. To better inform clinical practice, future prospective cohort studies are needed to identify the timing of these neuromuscular changes across the ACLR rehabilitation continuum and determine whether interventions can alter the deleterious outcomes that have long-term effects on neuromuscular function and joint health.Early structural and biomechanical changes observed after ACL injury and surgical reconstruction may also be associated with changes in molecular biomarkers of cartilage collagen turnover and joint health status after injury.167–169 New data presented at the retreat suggested that significant differences were present in the ratio of type II collagen degradation (C1, 2C, and C2C) to synthesis (CPII) within 15 days of injury (Trump et al abstract #32) between patients with ACL injuries and uninjured control participants. Furthermore, these ratios continued to decrease at the time of surgery and 6 months after surgery in patients with ACL injuries but did not change in uninjured control participants. These decreases were primarily driven by an increase in serum CPII concentration, which indicates that cartilage collagen turnover may be dysregulated early after ACL injury. This finding is consistent with the emerging literature in this area168; however, the implications for long-term joint health and the risk of PTOA remain unclear.The following priorities for research in this area were discussed.Participants also engaged in a discussion (led by Kenneth L. Cameron, PhD, MPH, ATC) about the potential for establishing a collaborative, multicenter ACL injury research network. With an added focus on early deficits after ACL injury and the long-term consequences of ACL injury at this year's meeting, attendees discussed opportunities for establishing a collaborative ACL injury research network that could span the time course of ACL injury from primary injury prevention to secondary and tertiary prevention of PTOA after injury. Many studies of ACL injury risk factors and outcomes have been cross-sectional or retrospective in design, involved small samples, applied disparate methods, and produced conflicting results. These factors make it challenging to answer important questions and limit the ability of researchers and clinicians to interpret the findings. The goal of a collaborative, multicenter research network would be to address some of these existing limitations. The ongoing interest in the ACL Research Retreat and other such meetings suggests that such a need and interest exist, and this was further reinforced by the postmeeting survey, which indicated that all respondents (N = 31) were in favor of such a network, and 84% of respondents had a strong interest in participating. A brief overview of that discussion follows, with the identified critical steps and barriers to forming a collaborative, multicenter research network in this area.Initially, the discussion focused on existing multicenter research groups, how they are structured, lessons learned from these groups, and existing gaps that are not currently being addressed. Multicenter research networks include the National Collegiate Athletic Association-Department of Defense (NCAA-DoD) Grand Alliance Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium174; the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON)175; the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS)176; and the Military Orthopaedics Tracking Injuries and Outcomes Network (MOTION).177 Most closely aligned with the goal of developing a collaborative multicenter ACL injury research network were the MOON and MARS groups, which are primarily focused on patient-reported and surgical outcomes after primary ACL reconstruction and revision surgery, respectively. However, primary injury-prevention efforts, physical function after rehabilitation, and return to participation and full activity have received little attention from these groups.175 The simultaneous collections of patient-reported outcomes, quantitative MRI results, and mechanical and biochemical markers as performed for the Stanford University prospective ACLR cohort,178,179 while challenging, were considered highly important to understanding PTOA development. The current knowledge gaps that could be addressed by a collaborative, multicenter ACL injury research network are described in Table 2.Next, the group addressed the critical first steps to establishing a network, including practical considerations such as interest in participating, the feasibility of collaborative, multicenter research (including potential barriers and strategies to overcome), and the potential for funding support. Considerations for research network structure, organization, leadership, and function included the potential role of study cores (eg, biomechanics, imaging, neuromotor function, biospecimens), special interest groups (eg, return-to-participation criteria and outcomes), and implications for data sharing and dissemination.Finally, the group discussed possible common data elements across primary, secondary, and tertiary risk and prevention that could be collected as part of this network (Table 3). Clinical measures that could be readily obtained by all network participants are followed in the list by biomarkers requiring specialized equipment or technical training (or both). This compilation is intended to provide a starting point for further discussion of the primary data elements to be collected. Although examples of specific measures are provided in some cases, the actual measures would ultimately be determined by network members based on the best available evidence that continues to emerge, feasibility, and acceptable multicenter measurement consistency and precision. In some areas, further research may be required to determine specific measures. For example, it is increasingly apparent that psychosocial factors are extremely important, but few researchers have examined these factors in relation to ACL injury risk and outcomes after injury and surgery.Ideally, network participants would begin to collect these measures before injury (preinjury baseline) to separate preexisting risk factors from those resulting from the injury. Postinjury visits should then include time of injury; time of surgery; 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-ups; and time of return to activity to determine how these variables changed over time after injury, how the patients responded to therapeutic interventions, how clinicians assessed safe return to play, and how the various factors were associated with initiation and progression of PTOA and changes in joint health over time. As much as possible, these postinjury visits should be aligned with medical visits to enhance feasibility and reduce the participant burden. For those measures that change over time (eg, hormones, laxity, BMI, strength), consideration should be given to assessing these relative to maturational status and, in menstruating females, relative to cycle phase.Advances in research continue to shape what we know about the ACL injury continuum and the important directions for future research that are needed to move the field forward.

Establishing normative performance values of modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) and Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) scores and their relationship to age in female adolescent footballers,2019-08-23,,,,"Objectives: to establish normative performance values for the modified Star Excursion Balance Test and derived Limb Symmetry Index scores in non-injured female adolescent footballers, and identity if there is a relationship between the aforementioned metrics and ageDesign: single measure study design Setting: A single football club’s female regional talent and development teams Participants: Thirty-four uninjured female footballers, aged between 13 to 18 years.Main Outcome Measures: Modified Star Excursion Balance Test and derived Limb Symmetry Index scores.Results: There were no statistically significant differences between dominant and non-dominant leg distance scores in any of the modified Star Excursion Balance Test specific reach direction or composite scores. Across all age groups, mean dominant leg total distance scores ranged from 231.5 cm to 250.4 cm whilst non-dominant total distance scores ranged from 234.3 cm to 253.3 cm. Mean Limb Symmetry Index values ranged from 97.8% to 100.5%. Age accounted for approximately 8% of the variance within dominant, non-dominant total distance and Limb Symmetry Index scores.Conclusions: Our study has established normative performance values for the mSEBT and derived LSI scores in non-injured female adolescent footballers. Age had a very limited ability in accounting for the variance observed for composite scores in dominant, non-dominant and LSI based scores.","This paper establishes normative performance values for the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) and Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) scores in uninjured female adolescent footballers, aged 13 to 18. The study finds that age has a limited impact on the variance of these scores, with mean values indicating high symmetry and balance performance within this population."
Using differential ratings of perceived exertion to assess agreement between coach and player perceptions of soccer training intensity: An exploratory investigation,2019-08-19,,,,"We aimed to assess the coach-player agreement of subjective soccer training loads via differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE). The coach initially underwent quantifiable familiarisation (blackness test) with the Borg CR100 scale. Data were collected from 16 semi-professional soccer players across seven consecutive training sessions. For the measurement of subjective training load, the coach and players provided dRPE (CR100) for legs (RPE-L), breathlessness (RPE-B) and technical exertion (RPE-T). Coach-prescribed dRPE were recorded prior to training, with coach observed and player reported dRPE collected post training. Statistical equivalence bounds for agreement between coach (prescribed and observed) and player reported dRPE scores were 4 arbitrary units on the CR100 and we used a probability outcome of likely (≥75%) to infer realistic equivalence. Following three familiarisation sessions, the coach improved their blackness test score from 39% to 83%. Coach observed and player reported RPE-T scores were likely equivalent, with all other comparisons not realistically equivalent. Since training prescription is coach-led, our data highlight the importance of accurate internal load measurement and feedback in soccer. The improved accuracy and precision of coach intensity estimation after three attempts at the blackness test suggests that this method could be worthwhile to researchers and practitioners employing dRPE.","This paper investigates the agreement between coaches and players regarding perceived training intensity using differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) in soccer. The findings indicate that while coach and player ratings for technical exertion were likely equivalent, discrepancies existed in other areas, emphasizing the need for accurate internal load measurement in training to enhance performance outcomes."
Trunk and Upper Body Fatigue Adversely Affect Running Economy: A Three-Armed Randomized Controlled Crossover Pilot Trial,2019-08-19,,,,"Trunk muscle fatigue and its negative relationship with running economy (RE) is frequently recognized by practitioners but lacks evidence-based support. Thus, this three-armed randomized controlled crossover pilot trial (RCT) examined the effects of trunk and upper body fatigue protocols on RE, trunk muscle isometric rate of force production, and lactate response in runners. Seven well-trained runners (2 males and 5 females) randomly underwent control (CON), trunk fatigue (TRK), and upper body fatigue (UPR) protocols on three different lab visits. Both workload-matched fatigue protocols-consisting of 24 min of a circuit weight routine-elicited comparable rates of perceived exertion, heart rate responses, and lactate accumulations. As expected, core muscle strength assessed with isometric testing immediately before and after both fatigue protocols, decreased notably. RE (VO2/kg bodyweight averaged for 1 min) was determined during a 15 min individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) run at 4, 9 and 14 min. The IAT (13.9 to 15.8 km/h) was determined on lab visit one using an incremental treadmill running protocol to volitional exhaustion. RE differed, although not significantly, between CON and both fatigue protocols by 0.75 (4th min) to 1.5 ml/min/kg (9th and 14th min) bodyweight (Time × Mode Interaction: p = 0.2, np2 = 0.40) with a moderate to large effect size. Despite no signficance, the largest RE differences were observed between TRK and CON (and underscored by the moderate to large effect size). This preliminary pilot RCT revealed that both UPR and TRK conditions might adversely impact running economy at a high intensity, steady state running pace. Future studies should elucidate if these findings are replicable in large scale trials and, in turn, whether periodized core training can beneficially preserve RE.","The paper investigates the effects of trunk and upper body muscle fatigue on running economy (RE) in well-trained runners through a randomized controlled crossover trial. The findings suggest that both fatigue protocols negatively impacted RE, with the most significant difference observed between trunk fatigue and control conditions, indicating potential implications for future research on core training to preserve running efficiency."
Comparison of selected lower limb biomechanical variables between university of ibadan sportsmen with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome,2019-08-16,,,,"Patellofemoral pain syndrome is common among athletes who participate in jumping, running and pivoting sports.The aim of this study was to compare selected lower limb biomechanical variables between University of Ibadan students (athletes) with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome.The research design for this study was a case control survey and a purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants.Two hundred and twenty two (191(85.8%)males and 31 (14.2%)females) sportsmen participated in this study.The participants' age was between 20-29 years.Fourty sportsmen tested positive to Clarke's test while 27 sportsmen tested positive to Eccentric step test.Measurements of static quadriceps angle, hamstring tightness and navicular height were taken for all participants.Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of mean, standard deviation, percentages and inferential statistics of Independent 't' test.Comparison of selected lower limb biomechanical variables between university of ibadan sportsmen with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome","The paper investigates lower limb biomechanical variables in University of Ibadan athletes, comparing those with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Core-Muscle Training and Neuromuscular Control of the Lower Limb and Trunk,2019-08-06,,,,"Comprehensive injury-prevention training (plyometric, agility, balance, and core-stability exercises) has been shown to decrease sport-related injury. The relationship between trunk control and sport-related injury has been emphasized; however, the isolated effects of core-muscle training are unclear.To investigate the effect of a simple 8-week core-muscle-training program on the neuromuscular control of the lower limb and trunk during jump landing and single-legged squatting.Controlled laboratory study.Laboratory.Seventeen female collegiate basketball players were randomly divided into training (n = 9; age = 19.7 ± 0.9 years) and control (n = 8; age = 20.3 ± 2.5 years) groups.The training group completed the core-muscle-training program in addition to daily practice, and the control group performed only daily practice. Kinematic and kinetic data during a drop-jump test and single-legged squat were acquired using a 3-dimensional motion-analysis system.Three-dimensional hip, knee, and trunk kinematics; knee kinetics; and isokinetic muscle strength were measured at the pretraining and posttraining phases.For the drop-jump test, the maximal trunk-flexion angle increased (P = .008), and peak knee-valgus moment (P = .008) decreased in the training group. For the single-legged squat, the peak trunk-flexion angle increased (P = .04), and the total amount of trunk lateral-inclination angle (P = .02) and peak knee-valgus moment (P = .008) decreased in the training group. We observed no changes in the control group.A consecutive 8-week core-muscle-training program improved lower limb and trunk biomechanics. These altered biomechanical patterns could be favorable to preventing sport-related injuries.","The paper investigates the effects of an 8-week core-muscle-training program on the neuromuscular control of the lower limb and trunk in female collegiate basketball players, emphasizing injury prevention. Results indicate that the training significantly improved biomechanical patterns, including trunk and knee movements during specific jump and squat tests, which may help reduce sport-related injuries."
Repetitive Head Impact Exposure in College Football Following an NCAA Rule Change to Eliminate Two-A-Day Preseason Practices: A Study from the NCAA-DoD CARE Consortium,2019-08-06,,,,"Repetitive head impact exposure sustained by athletes of contact sports has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for concussion and a possible explanation for the high degree of variability in sport-related concussion biomechanics. In an attempt to limit repetitive head impact exposure during the football preseason, the NCAA eliminated two-a-day practices in 2017, while maintaining the total number of team practice sessions. The objective of this study was to quantify head impact exposure during the preseason and regular season in Division I college football athletes to determine whether the 2017 NCAA ruling decreased head impact exposure. 342 unique athletes from five NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs were consented and enrolled. Head impacts were recorded using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System during the entire fall preseasons and regular seasons in 2016 and 2017. Despite the elimination of two-a-day practices, the number of preseason contact days increased in 2017, with an increase in average hourly impact exposure (i.e., contact intensity), resulting in a significant increase in total head impact burden (+ 26%) for the 2017 preseason. This finding would indicate that the 2017 NCAA ruling was not effective at reducing the head impact burden during the football preseason. Additionally, athletes sustained a significantly higher number of recorded head impacts per week (+ 40%) during the preseason than the regular season, implicating the preseason as a time of elevated repetitive head impact burden. With increased recognition of a possible association between repetitive head impact exposure and concussion, increased preseason exposure may predispose certain athletes to a higher risk of concussion during the preseason and regular season. Accordingly, efforts at reducing concussion incidence in contact sports should include a reduction in overall head impact exposure.","The paper investigates the effects of the NCAA's 2017 rule change, which eliminated two-a-day preseason practices, on head impact exposure in Division I college football athletes. Despite the rule, the study found a significant increase in head impact burden during the 2017 preseason, highlighting that the change did not effectively reduce head impact exposure and may increase concussion risk for athletes."
The level of Polish youth champions’ temperamental qualities in football,2019-08-03,,,,"There are many factors which contribute to a successful sports career in football. One of the most important ones is players’ comprehensive preparation which consists of motor, technico-tactical and psychical components. The study focuses on a selected psychical aspect and more precisely on the temperamental features that describe and explain relationship between a man and environment.The aim of the study was to determine and compare the level of highly qualified young footballers’ temperamental properties in relation to those of the average people of the same age. The subject of the research was 31 players of the Lech Poznań club (Polish champions U-17 from 2016). The research was carried out using the EAS-D questionnaire which consists of five scales: dissatisfaction, fear, anger, activity and sociability.In the conducted study, there was a statistically significant differentiation of the results between the respondents and the average people at the level of two temperamental traits such as fear (a lower score in football players) and activity (a higher score in tested football players compared to the average people of the same age).","The paper investigates the temperamental qualities of Polish youth football champions, focusing on the relationship between temperament and environmental interaction. It compares the temperamental traits of 31 U-17 players from Lech Poznań to their peers, revealing that these players exhibit lower levels of fear and higher levels of activity."
A common neural signature of brain injury in concussion and subconcussion,2019-08-02,,,,"The midbrain is biomechanically susceptible to force loading from repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RSHI), is a site of tauopathy in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and regulates functions (e.g., eye movements) often disrupted in concussion. In a prospective longitudinal design, we demonstrate there are reductions in midbrain white matter integrity due to a single season of collegiate football, and that the amount of reduction in midbrain white matter integrity is related to the amount of rotational acceleration to which players' brains are exposed. We then replicate the observation of reduced midbrain white matter integrity in a retrospective cohort of individuals with frank concussion, and further show that variance in white matter integrity is correlated with levels of serum-based tau, a marker of blood-brain barrier disruption. These findings mean that noninvasive structural MRI of the midbrain is a succinct index of both clinically silent white matter injury as well as frank concussion.","The paper investigates the impact of repetitive subconcussive head impacts on midbrain white matter integrity in collegiate football players. It demonstrates a correlation between reduced midbrain integrity, rotational acceleration exposure, and serum-based tau levels, suggesting that noninvasive structural MRI can serve as an effective index for detecting both subtle and overt brain injuries associated with concussion."
Posture correctness of young female soccer players,2019-08-01,,,,"The objectives of the study were to evaluate the correctness of the body posture of female soccer players in the frontal plane from the back based on selected body points in two static positions (habitual and actively corrected) using a non-contact optical measurement method. Forty-two young women (aged 16-20) playing soccer in a sports club in Poland were examined and compared with controls. The spatial coordinates (x, y, z) of the selected body points were determined. Four points (OcL, OcR, PvL and PvR) were extracted and used to calculate vectors [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for analysis. The results show that median of the pelvic line angle was positive (PvR was lower than PvL) in both groups. For the habitual posture, the absolute value of the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles in the pelvic line was almost three times greater among the soccer players than the controls (ratio between soccer players and controls: 2.93). Static postural imbalances in female soccer players require diagnosis of the sacroiliac joints with analysis of lumbar-pelvic system support and inhibition in the context of myofascial connection integration. Exercises can be implemented to stabilize the lumbar-pelvis complex as prophylaxis for spinal overload during the training cycle.","This paper evaluates the body posture of young female soccer players in two static positions using a non-contact optical measurement method, comparing their postural correctness to that of controls. It highlights significant postural imbalances among the soccer players, suggesting the need for diagnostic assessment and potential exercises to stabilize the lumbar-pelvis complex to prevent spinal overload during training."
Sex Effects on Ankle Biomechanics During Sports-Relevant Tasks and Peroneal Muscle Parameters,2019-08-01,,,,"Introduction: Ankle sprains from excessive inversion are the most frequent sports- related injury. Common ankle prophylactics are designed to prevent injury by limiting excessive ankle inversion, yet may restrict other ankle motions leading to repeated re-injury. Females are twice as likely as males to suffer an ankle sprain, however, it is unknown if a sex dimorphism in ankle biomechanics exists when wearing ankle prophylactics, and whether differences in the peroneal musculature exist between sexes. Purpose: To quantify the ability of ankle prophylactics (Ankle Roll Guard (ARG), Brace, Control, and Tape) to prevent excessive ankle inversion during a sudden inversion event, and determine whether the effectiveness of the ankle prophylactics and in vivo peroneal muscle parameters differ between sexes. Methods: Thirty-two (16 male and 16 female) participants had dominant limb (i.e., braced) frontal and sagittal plane ankle biomechanics, including peak inversion and plantarflexion angle and range of motion (ROM), and time to peak inversion, quantified during the sudden inversion event with four prophylactic conditions (ARG, Brace, Control, and Tape) and peroneal muscle parameters recorded. With each prophylactic, participants performed five successful trials of the sudden inversion event. Peroneal muscle parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and stiffness, were quantified in vivo using ultrasound shear-wave elastography, while peroneal strength was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. Statistical Analysis: All kinematic variables were submitted to a RM ANOVA to test for main effect and interaction of brace (ARG, Brace, Control, and Tape) and sex (male and female). Peroneal muscle parameters were also submitted to independent samples t-test to test the effect of sex. Results: A prophylactic by sex interaction (p = 0.010), revealed females exhibit greater ankle inversion ROM with Control and ARG (p = 0.001, p = 0.010) compared to males. Females also exhibited greater ankle inversion ROM with ARG compared to Brace (p = 0.001), and Control compared to Brace and Tape (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), while males exhibited no significant difference between any prophylactic condition (p > 0.05). Ankle prophylactic impacted ankle inversion ROM (p < 0.001), time to peak inversion (p < 0.001), and peak plantarflexion angle (p < 0.001) and ROM (p < 0.001). Females exhibited smaller peroneal PCSA (p = 0.002) and dorsiflexion strength (p = 0.047), but sex had no significant effect on peroneal strength (p =0.142) or stiffness (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The protective benefits of ankle prophylactics may depend on the specific device and sex of the user. With the lace-up brace and tape, participants decreased ankle biomechanics associated with injury, but this protective benefit was only evident for females. Females exhibited a sex dimorphism in ankle biomechanics during the sudden inversion event, and smaller and weaker peroneals that may contribute to the sex disparity in injury rate.","This paper investigates the effects of sex on ankle biomechanics during sports-related tasks, specifically focusing on ankle sprains and the effectiveness of various prophylactics (Ankle Roll Guard, Brace, Control, and Tape). The results indicate that females display greater ankle inversion range of motion with certain prophylactics and have smaller peroneal muscle cross-sectional area and strength, potentially contributing to their higher injury rates compared to males."
Differences Between Bimodal and Unimodal Force-time Curves During Countermovement Jump,2019-07-31,,,,"Abstract This study aimed to explore the biomechanical differences between single and double peak ground reaction force-time curves during the countermovement jump with respect to kinematics, kinetics, and coordination of the lower extremities. Twenty-five college students were stratified into a single peak curve group and a double peak curve group. Eight infrared cameras and two force platforms were synchronized to collect the data. Independent t-tests were performed with groups for each dependent kinematic, kinetic and time of the joint extensor concentric contraction variable. Repeated one-way analysis of variance measurements were performed for the time of the ankle, knee and hip extensor concentric contraction in each group. The double peak curve was associated with larger jump height, reactive strength index modified, rate of force development, impulse, hip, knee and ankle flexion, extension angular displacement, and hip and knee moments (p&lt;0.05). The double peak curve group revealed a better hip, knee and ankle (proximal to distal) timing of extensor concentric contractions sequence of the lower extremities during the countermovement jump (p&lt;0.05). The double peak curve group exhibited a more effective countermovement jump movement with respect to biomechanics compared to the single peak curve group.","This paper investigates the biomechanical differences between bimodal and unimodal ground reaction force-time curves during countermovement jumps, focusing on kinematic and kinetic factors. The findings indicate that the double peak force curve is associated with greater jump height, improved reactive strength, and more effective timing of lower extremity movements during jumps."
Accounting for Variance in Concussion Tolerance Between Individuals: Comparing Head Accelerations Between Concussed and Physically Matched Control Subjects,2019-07-24,,,,"Researchers have been collecting head impact data from instrumented football players to characterize the biomechanics of concussion for the past 15 years, yet the link between biomechanical input and clinical outcome is still not well understood. We have previously shown that even though concussive biomechanics might be unremarkable in large datasets of head impacts, the impacts causing injury are of high magnitude for the concussed individuals relative to their impact history. This finding suggests a need to account for differences in tolerance at the individual level. In this study, we identified control subjects for our concussed subjects who demonstrated traits we believed were correlated to factors thought to affect injury tolerance, including height, mass, age, race, and concussion history. A total of 502 college football players were instrumented with helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays and provided complete baseline assessment data, 44 of which sustained a total of 49 concussion. Biomechanical measures quantifying impact frequency and acceleration magnitude were compared between groups. On average, we found that concussed subjects experienced 93.8 more head impacts (p = 0.0031), 10.2 more high magnitude impacts (p = 0.0157), and 1.9 × greater risk-weighted exposure (p = 0.0175) than their physically matched controls. This finding provides further evidence that head impact data need to be considered at the individual level and that cohort wide assessments may be of little value in the context of concussion.","This paper investigates the variance in concussion tolerance among individuals by analyzing head acceleration data in football players. The study reveals that concussed subjects experienced significantly more head impacts and high-magnitude impacts compared to physically matched controls, emphasizing the importance of considering individual differences in head impact data to understand concussion risks."
Influence of a Functional Core Stability Program on Trunk and Knee Joint Biomechanics in Female Athletes During Lateral Movements,2019-07-24,,,,"Mornieux, G, Weltin, E, Friedman, C, Pauls, M, Forsythe, S, and Gollhofer, A. Influence of a functional core stability program on trunk and knee joint biomechanics in female athletes during lateral movements. J Strength Cond Res 35(10): 2713-2719, 2021-Trunk positioning has been shown to be associated with knee joint loading during athletic tasks, especially changes of direction. Quasistatic and conventional core stability (CS) training did not improve the biomechanics of cutting maneuvers according to reports in the literature. The purpose of this study was to test whether a 5-week dynamic and functional CS training program would improve trunk positioning and knee joint control during lateral movements. Nineteen female athletes participated in a longitudinal study, where lateral reactive jumps (LRJs) and unanticipated cuttings were performed before and after CS training (15 training sessions within 5 weeks) while 3D kinematics and kinetics were measured. In addition, core endurance and power were evaluated. Core stability training increased trunk rotation in the new movement direction (p = 0.02) during LRJ. However, lateral trunk lean was significantly increased during LRJ (from 5.6 to 7°) and cuttings (from 3.8 to 5.8°) after CS training. Knee joint abduction moment was not influenced. Finally, core endurance (p < 0.01) and core power (p < 0.001) were significantly improved after CS training. A 5-week dynamic and functional CS training program improved core muscle endurance and power. This might explain the better trunk rotation toward the new movement direction during LRJ; however, it was not effective during unanticipated cuttings. The practical application of this research will allow strength and conditioning professionals to setup training programs with simple and relevant exercises to increase the core endurance and power of trained individuals.","This paper investigates the effects of a 5-week dynamic core stability (CS) training program on trunk positioning and knee joint control in female athletes during lateral movements. The results indicate improved core endurance and power, and enhanced trunk rotation during lateral reactive jumps, although the training did not significantly alter knee joint abduction moments or improve biomechanics during unanticipated cutting maneuvers."
Effects of Neuromuscular Training on Agility Performance in Elite Soccer Players,2019-07-23,,,,"Background: Agility in general and change-of-direction speed (CoD) in particular represent important performance determinants in elite soccer. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of a 6-week neuromuscular training program on agility performance, and to determine differences in movement times between the slower and faster turning directions in elite soccer players. Materials and Methods: Twenty male elite soccer players from the Stade Rennais Football Club (Ligue 1, France) participated in this study. The players were randomly assigned to a neuromuscular training group (NTG, n=10) or an active control (CG, n=10) according to their playing position. NTG participated in a 6-week, twice per week neuromuscular training program that included CoD, plyometric and dynamic stability exercises. Neuromuscular training replaced the regular warm-up program. Each training session lasted 30 minutes. CG continued their regular training program. Training volume was similar between groups. Before and after the intervention, the two groups performed a reactive agility test that included 180° left and right body rotations followed by a 5-m linear sprint. The weak side was defined as the left/right turning direction that produced slower overall movement times (MT). Reaction time (RT) was assessed and defined as the time from the first appearance of a visual stimulus until the athlete's first movement. Results: No significant between-group baseline differences were observed for RT or MT. Significant group x time interactions were found for MT (p=0.012, effect size = 0.332, small) for the slower and faster directions (p=0.011, effect size = 0.627, moderate). Significant pre-to post improvements in MT were observed for NTG but not CG (p=0.011, effect size = 0.877, moderate). For NTG, post-hoc analyses revealed significant MT improvements for the slower (p=0.012, effect size = 0.897, moderate) and faster directions (p=0.017, effect size = 0.968, moderate). Conclusions: Our results illustrate that 6 weeks of neuromuscular training with 2 sessions per week included in the warm-up program, significantly enhanced agility performance in elite soccer players. Moreover, improvements were found on both sides during body rotations. Thus, practitioners are advised to focus their training programs on both turning directions.","This study investigates the effects of a 6-week neuromuscular training program on agility performance in elite soccer players. The findings indicate significant improvements in movement times for both slower and faster turning directions, suggesting that incorporating neuromuscular training into warm-up routines can enhance agility in soccer athletes."
Kinematic Profile of Visually Impaired Football Players During Specific Sports Actions,2019-07-23,,,,"Abstract Blind football, or Football 5-a-side, is a very popular sport amongst visually impaired individuals (VI) worldwide. However, little is known regarding the movement patterns these players perform in sports actions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether visually impaired players present changes in their movement patterns in specific functional tasks compared with sighted amateur football players. Six VI and eight sighted amateur football players performed two functional tasks: (1) 5 m shuttle test and (2) 60 s ball passing against a wall. The sighted players performed the tests while fully sighted (SIG) as well as blindfolded (BFO). During both tasks, full-body kinematics was recorded using an inertial motion capture system. The maximal center-of-mass speed and turning center-of-mass speed were computed during the 5 m shuttle test. Foot resultant speed, bilateral arm speed, and trunk flexion were measured during the 60 s ball passing test. The results showed that VI players achieved lower maximal and turning speed compared to SIG players (p &lt; 0.05), but BFO were slower than the VI players. The VI players presented similar foot contact speed during passes when compared to SIG, but they presented greater arm movement speed (p &lt; 0.05) compared to both SIG and BFO. In addition, VI players presented greater trunk flexion angles while passing when compared to both SIG and BFO (p &lt; 0.05). It is concluded that VI players present slower speed while running and turning, and they adopt specific adaptations from arm movements and trunk flexion to perform passes.","This paper investigates the kinematic profiles of visually impaired (VI) football players during specific functional tasks compared to sighted amateur players. It reveals that VI players exhibit slower running and turning speeds, alongside adaptations in arm movement and trunk flexion during ball passing, highlighting the distinct movement patterns associated with visual impairment in football."
Characteristics of potential concussive events in three elite football tournaments,2019-07-22,,,,"Objective Identify patterns in the nature and characteristics of potential concussive events (PCEs) in football. Methods This study analysed the incidence and characteristics of PCEs that occurred during the 2014 and 2018 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cups, and the 2016 UEFA Euro Cup. PCEs were defined as direct head collision incidents resulting in the athlete being unable to immediately resume play for at least 5 sec following impact. Results A total of 218 incidents were identified in 179 matches (1.22 per match, 36.91 per 1000 hours of exposure). The most common mechanism of PCE was elbow-to-head (28.7%, n=68). The frontal region was the most frequently affected location of impact with 22.8% (n=54). Conclusion Our study defined the identification, prevalence and nature of PCEs in professional international soccer tournaments. Our findings indicate the different contexts and mechanisms of head contact and contact to different regions of the head can be associated with varying signs of concussion. The results highlight targets for future injury prevention strategies.","This paper investigates the patterns and characteristics of potential concussive events (PCEs) in elite football, focusing on incidents during the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups and the 2016 UEFA Euro Cup. The study identifies 218 PCEs across 179 matches, with common mechanisms being elbow-to-head impacts, and emphasizes the need for tailored injury prevention strategies based on the contexts and mechanisms of head contact."
Measuring biomechanical loads in team sports – from lab to field,2019-07-20,,,,"The benefits of differentiating between the physiological and biomechanical load-response pathways in football and other (team) sports have become increasingly recognised. In contrast to physiological loads however, the biomechanical demands of training and competition are still not well understood, primarily due to the difficulty of quantifying biomechanical loads in a field environment. Although musculoskeletal adaptation and injury are known to occur at a tissue level, several biomechanical load metrics are available that quantify loads experienced by the body as a whole, its different structures and the individual tissues that are part of these structures. This paper discusses the distinct aspects and challenges that are associated with measuring biomechanical loads at these different levels in laboratory and/or field contexts. Our hope is that through this paper, sport scientists and practitioners will be able to critically consider the value and limitations of biomechanical load metrics and will keep pursuing new methods to measure these loads within and outside the lab, as a detailed load quantification is essential to better understand the biomechanical load-response pathways that occur in the field.","The paper discusses the measurement of biomechanical loads in team sports, emphasizing the challenges of quantifying these loads in field environments compared to laboratory settings. It highlights the importance of understanding these loads for assessing musculoskeletal adaptation and injury risk, encouraging sport scientists and practitioners to explore new methods for accurate load quantification."
Concussion related deficits in the general population predict impairments in varsity footballers,2019-07-16,,,,"ObjectiveWe investigated the long-term cognitive effects of concussion in 19,261 members of the general population and a cohort of varsity American football players with a history of frequent head impacts, using tests that are known to be sensitive to small changes in performance. MethodsWe asked 19,261 participants to complete a demographic questionnaire and 12 cognitive tests measuring aspects of executive function, including inhibitory control. We compared the performance of those reporting a history of concussion (post-concussion) to those reporting no history of concussion (non-concussed) on the cognitive battery and four non-cognitive variables. We used the results of this population-level study to predict the profile of cognitive performance in varsity American football players, who completed the same cognitive tasks. ResultsPost-concussion and non-concussed participants did not differ on 11 of the 12 cognitive tasks employed. However, on a test of inhibitory control based on the classic Stroop paradigm, post-concussion participants showed accuracy-related impairments specific to the incongruent conditions of the task. Post-concussion participants reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and trouble concentrating. An entirely independent sample of 74 varsity American football players demonstrated the same pattern of impairment: compared to healthy controls, they scored significantly lower on the test of inhibitory control but were indistinguishable from controls on the 11 other tasks.InterpretationSelf-reported concussion is not associated with long-term general effects on cognitive function. Nevertheless, those who report at least one concussion and those who expose themselves to long-term frequent sport-related head impacts, do have a modest, but statistically robust, deficit of inhibitory control.","This paper investigates the long-term cognitive effects of concussions in a general population and varsity American football players, focusing on executive function and inhibitory control. The findings indicate that while most cognitive performance remains unaffected by concussion history, participants with concussion experience exhibited specific impairments in inhibitory control, particularly in incongruent task conditions."
A Randomized Controlled Trial of PEEK Versus Titanium Interference Screws for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With 2-Year Follow-up,2019-07-15,,,,"Background: Graft fixation with interference screws for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a highly successful technique. Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a novel thermoplastic polymer with high biocompatibility and mechanical properties that mimic native bone, and it can be imaged on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without signal flare. Purpose: To compare the clinical performance of ACL reconstruction with PEEK and titanium interference screws at 2 years and to evaluate a novel method of measuring tunnel volume. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 133 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with 4-strand hamstring autografts and were randomized to have titanium or PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial tunnel fixation. At 2 years, subjective Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores were assessed and clinical examination performed. At 12 months, MRI was performed to assess graft incorporation and cyst formation, and a novel technique was employed to measure tunnel volumes. Results: There were no significant differences in graft rerupture rate, contralateral ACL rupture rate, subjective outcomes, or objective outcomes. In the titanium and PEEK groups, MRI demonstrated high overall rates of graft integration (96%-100% and 90%-93%, respectively) and ligamentization (89% and 84%) and low rates of synovitis (22% and 10%) and cyst formation (0%-18% and 13%-15%). There was a higher proportion of patients with incomplete graft integration within the femoral tunnel in the PEEK group as compared with the titanium group (10% vs 0%, P = .03); however, the authors suggest that metal artifact precluded proper assessment of the graft in the titanium group by MRI. Tunnel volumes also appeared to be equivalent in the 2 groups and were measured with a novel technique that was highly reproducible in the PEEK group secondary to the absence of flare. Conclusion: Two-year clinical analysis of PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial fixation of ACL reconstructions showed equivalent clinical performance to titanium interference screws. Given the excellent mechanical characteristics, biological compatibility, and absence of metal artifact on MRI, PEEK has become our material of choice for interference screw fixation in ACL reconstruction.","This paper compares the clinical performance of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and titanium interference screws for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction over a two-year period. The study finds no significant differences in clinical outcomes or graft integration rates, suggesting PEEK's potential as a preferable alternative due to its favorable mechanical properties and compatibility with imaging techniques."
Injury Surveillance in Major League Soccer: A 4-Year Comparison of Injury on Natural Grass Versus Artificial Turf Field,2019-07-15,,,,"Background: Artificial playing surfaces are becoming more common due to decreased cost of maintenance and increased field usability across different environmental conditions. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has approved newer generation artificial turf for soccer competition at the elite level, but many elite-level athletes prefer to play on natural grass surfaces due to a perceived increase in injury rate, discomfort, and fatigability on artificial turf. Hypothesis: Injury rates and rates of individually categorized types of injury experienced on artificial turf are noninferior to rates of injury on the standard comparator, natural grass, in elite-level Major League Soccer athletes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Over the course of 4 Major League Soccer seasons (2013-2016), athlete injury data were recorded electronically. Injury data recorded in matches between 2 Major League Soccer teams were then analyzed. Playing surface was known for each venue, and all artificial turf surfaces were rated as 2-star according to FIFA criteria. Incidence rate ratios (Artificial Turf ÷ Natural Grass) were calculated with a 95% CI (α = .05) for both overall injury incidence and individual injury subgroups. A noninferiority margin (δ) of 0.15 was used to determine noninferiority of injury incidence rates. Results: A total of 2174 in-game injuries were recorded during the study period, with 1.54 injuries per game on artificial turf and 1.49 injuries per game on natural grass (incidence rate ratio, 1.033; 95% CI, 0.937-1.139). Within injury subgroups, overall ankle injury, Achilles injury, and ankle fracture were found to have a statistically higher incidence on artificial turf. Artificial turf was found to be noninferior to natural grass for overall foot injury and forefoot injury. No statistically significant differences were found in knee injuries between the 2 surfaces. Conclusion: The overall rate of injury on artificial turf was noninferior to that on natural grass. Within individual injury categories, a higher rate of ankle injury was found on artificial turf. No other injury subgroup demonstrated statistically significant differences between surfaces. Clinical Relevance: FIFA 2-star rated artificial turf is a viable alternative to natural grass in elite-level soccer competition. Innovative research methods for comparing artificial turf versus natural grass may elucidate relative advantages with respect to player safety.","The paper examines the injury rates of Major League Soccer athletes on artificial turf compared to natural grass over four seasons. It concludes that artificial turf presents a noninferior overall injury rate, although it shows a higher incidence of specific injuries, such as ankle injuries, compared to natural grass."
Use of Machine Learning and Wearable Sensors to Predict Energetics and Kinematics of Cutting Maneuvers,2019-07-12,,,,"Changes of directions and cutting maneuvers, including 180-degree turns, are common locomotor actions in team sports, implying high mechanical load. While the mechanics and neurophysiology of turns have been extensively studied in laboratory conditions, modern inertial measurement units allow us to monitor athletes directly on the field. In this study, we applied four supervised machine learning techniques (linear regression, support vector regression/machine, boosted decision trees and artificial neural networks) to predict turn direction, speed (before/after turn) and the related positive/negative mechanical work. Reference values were computed using an optical motion capture system. We collected data from 13 elite female soccer players performing a shuttle run test, wearing a six-axes inertial sensor at the pelvis level. A set of 18 features (predictors) were obtained from accelerometers, gyroscopes and barometer readings. Turn direction classification returned good results (accuracy &gt; 98.4%) with all methods. Support vector regression and neural networks obtained the best performance in the estimation of positive/negative mechanical work (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.42–0.43, mean absolute error = 1.14–1.41 J) and running speed before/after the turns (R2 = 0.66–0.69, mean absolute error = 0.15–018 m/s). Although models can be extended to different angles, we showed that meaningful information on turn kinematics and energetics can be obtained from inertial units with a data-driven approach.","This paper investigates the use of machine learning techniques combined with wearable sensors to predict the kinematics and energetics of cutting maneuvers in team sports, specifically focusing on female soccer players. By applying supervised machine learning models, the study achieved high accuracy in classifying turn direction and effectively estimating mechanical work and running speeds during maneuvers, highlighting the potential for real-time analyses in athletic performance."
Lower Limbs Joint Loading – Case Study,2019-07-12,,,,"Injury prevention plays an important role in modern sport. The most commonly injured joint in male and female football players is the knee joint. It has been reported that approximately 60-85% of football injuries occur in the lower limbs. The aim of this study is to present the methods of biomechanical assessment of lower limbs joint loading during specific tasks (single leg squat (SLS) and single leg landing (SLL)). In this experimental setup, Qualisys Tracking Motion system synchronised with AMTII force plates embedded into the floor was used. The marker setup Salford Lower Limb model was used to track pelvis and lower body movements. By analysing biomechanical parameters (range of motion, internal moments, power, ground reaction forces) in all three planes it is possible to identify the structures and the imbalances of the lower extremity that need intervention and further decrease the possibility of injury to the knee and to evaluate an appropriate moment of return to play. This method showed a very high reproducibility and it can be considered as a reliable tool in assessing lower limb performance tasks.","This paper focuses on the biomechanical assessment of joint loading in the lower limbs, particularly during single leg squat and landing tasks, to aid in injury prevention in football players. It highlights the reliability of using the Qualisys Tracking Motion system and AMTII force plates to analyze biomechanical parameters and identify lower extremity imbalances that could lead to knee injuries."
"On-field Rehabilitation Part 1: 4 Pillars of High-Quality On-field Rehabilitation Are Restoring Movement Quality, Physical Conditioning, Restoring Sport-Specific Skills, and Progressively Developing Chronic Training Load",2019-07-10,,,,"Outcomes following long-term injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament rupture are unsatisfactory. To improve outcomes, we must improve rehabilitation practices. One aspect of the return-to-sport process that has received limited attention is on-field rehabilitation. This article is part 1 of a 2-part series aimed at discussing the important elements of on-field rehabilitation and illustrating how they can be applied across a 5-stage on-field rehabilitation program following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Relationship between Body Mass Index and Articular Injuries Accompanying Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear in Male Knees: A Retrospective Observational Study,2019-07-08,,,,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of body mass index (BMI), as a modifiable risk factor, on meniscal, chondral, and ligamentous injuries, as well as on bone marrow edema accompanying anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. This retrospective observational study analyzed 84 male patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction from 2015 to 2018. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 6 weeks of injury. Bone bruise, tendon, ligament, meniscal, and muscle injuries were evaluated. The surgery was performed within 3 months after the injury. Detailed arthroscopic findings (chondral, meniscal, and ligamentous injuries) were documented intraoperatively. The weight and height were used to quantify BMI (weight in kg/height in m2). Of the 84 male patients, 58 had associated articular injuries. The median age of the study population was 24 years (minimum: 17 years, maximum: 43 years) years. The mean BMI, height, and weight were 27.12 ± 0.78 kg/m2, 1.73 ± 0.01 m, and 81.17 ± 21.52 kg, respectively. The relationship between higher BMI and associated articular injuries (95% confidence interval [CI]) was statistically significant (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant relationship between weight and associated articular injuries (p = 0.003). Height and age were not predictive factors. Higher BMI and weight were significant risk factors for associated articular injuries in the presence of ACL tear. Height was not found to be a predictive factor. Higher BMI was associated with increased risk of medial and/or lateral meniscus tears and bone bruising.","This study investigates the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the occurrence of articular injuries associated with primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in male patients.

Cluster analysis successfully identifies clinically meaningful knee valgus moment patterns: Frequency of early peaks reflects sex-specific ACL injury incidence,2019-07-08,,,,"Abstract Background Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors report heterogenous results, analyze only a fraction of the data, and do not analyze data in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing of the peak value. Aims/Hypotheses The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be an early peak pattern, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have higher early peak frequencies. Methods N=213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N=35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared test. Results 6 discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P&lt;0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P&lt;0.001 for full test). Conclusions Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Higher frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher incidence of ACL injury.","This paper investigates knee valgus moment patterns in youth soccer and handball athletes to identify clinically relevant indicators of ACL injury risk, focusing on the early stance phase of movement. The study found distinct curve shapes with sex-specific early peak frequencies, highlighting that adolescent girls exhibit a higher frequency of early peaks, correlating with their increased ACL injury incidence."
Classification of Soccer and Basketball Players’ Jumping Performance Characteristics: A Logistic Regression Approach,2019-07-04,,,,"This study aimed to examine countermovement jump (CMJ) kinetic data using logistic regression, in order to distinguish sports-related mechanical profiles. Eighty-one professional basketball and soccer athletes participated, each performing three CMJs on a force platform. Inferential parametric and nonparametric statistics were performed to explore group differences. Binary logistic regression was used to model the response variable (soccer or not soccer). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was reached for differences between groups in maximum braking rate of force development (RFDDmax, U79 = 1035), mean braking rate of force development (RFDDavg, U79 = 1038), propulsive impulse (IMPU, t79 = 2.375), minimum value of vertical displacement for center of mass (SBCMmin, t79 = 3.135), and time difference (% of impulse time; ΔΤ) between the peak value of maximum force value (FUmax) and SBCMmin (U79 = 1188). Logistic regression showed that RFDDavg, impulse during the downward phase (IMPD), IMPU, and ΔΤ were all significant predictors. The model showed that soccer group membership could be strongly related to IMPU, with the odds ratio being 6.48 times higher from the basketball group, whereas RFDDavg, IMPD, and ΔΤ were related to basketball group. The results imply that soccer players execute CMJ differently compared to basketball players, exhibiting increased countermovement depth and impulse generation during the propulsive phase.","This study investigates the countermovement jump (CMJ) kinetics of professional soccer and basketball players using logistic regression to distinguish the mechanical profiles associated with each sport. Key findings reveal significant differences in jump characteristics, with soccer players demonstrating deeper countermovement and greater impulse generation compared to basketball players."
Current Approaches to the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Injury Risk Assessment and Performance Prediction in Team Sports: a Systematic Review,2019-07-03,,,,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) opens an interesting perspective for predicting injury risk and performance in team sports. A better understanding of the techniques of AI employed and of the sports that are using AI is clearly warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify which AI approaches have been applied to investigate sport performance and injury risk and to find out which AI techniques each sport has been using. Systematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases were conducted for articles reporting AI techniques or methods applied to team sports athletes. Fifty-eight studies were included in the review with 11 AI techniques or methods being applied in 12 team sports.

Biomechanical Associates of Performance and Knee Joint Loads During A 70–90° Cutting Maneuver in Subelite Soccer Players,2019-07-03,,,,"McBurnie, AJ, Dos'Santos, T, Jones, PA. Biomechanical associates of performance and knee joint loads during a 70-90° cutting maneuver in subelite soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(11): 3190-3198, 2021-The aim of this study was to explore the ""performance-injury risk"" conflict during cutting, by examining whole-body joint kinematics and kinetics that are responsible for faster change-of-direction (COD) performance of a cutting task in soccer players, and to determine whether these factors relate to peak external multiplanar knee moments. 34 male soccer players (age: 20 ± 3.2 years; body mass: 73.5 ± 9.2 kg; height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m) were recruited to investigate the relationships between COD kinetics and kinematics with performance and multiplanar knee joint moments during cutting. Three-dimensional motion data using 10 Qualisys Oqus 7 infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction force data from 2 AMTI force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected to analyze the penultimate foot contact and final foot contact (FFC). Pearson's or Spearman's correlations coefficients revealed performance time (PT), peak external knee abduction moment (KAM), and peak external knee rotation moment (KRM) were all significantly related (p < 0.05) to horizontal approach velocity (PT: ρ = -0.579; peak KAM: ρ = 0.414; peak KRM: R = -0.568) and FFC peak hip flexor moment (PT: ρ = 0.418; peak KAM: ρ = -0.624; peak KRM: ρ = 0.517). Performance time was also significantly (p < 0.01) associated with horizontal exit velocity (ρ = -0.451) and, notably, multiplanar knee joint loading (peak KAM: ρ = -0.590; peak KRM: ρ = 0.525; peak KFM: ρ = -0.509). Cohen's d effect sizes (d) revealed that faster performers demonstrated significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 1.1-1.7) multiplanar knee joint loading, as well as significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 0.9-1.2) FFC peak hip flexor moments, PFC average horizontal GRFs, and peak knee adduction angles. To conclude, mechanics associated with faster cutting performance seem to be ""at odds"" with lower multiplanar knee joint loads. This highlights the potential performance-injury conflict present during cutting.","This study investigates the relationship between performance and knee joint loads during a cutting maneuver in subelite soccer players. It reveals that factors such as horizontal approach velocity and knee joint loading are significantly correlated with performance time, highlighting a potential conflict between achieving faster cutting performance and minimizing knee joint injuries."
A Novel Approach to Evaluate Brain Activation for Lower Extremity Motor Control,2019-07-03,,,,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to assess the consistency of a novel MR safe lower extremity motor control neuroimaging paradigm to elicit reliable sensorimotor region brain activity. METHODS Participants completed multiple sets of unilateral leg presses combining ankle, knee, and hip extension and flexion movements against resistance at a pace of 1.2 Hz while lying supine in a 3T MRI scanner. Regions of Interest (ROI) consisted of regions primarily involved in lower extremity motor control (right and left primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum). RESULTS The group analysis based on mixed effects paired samples t‐test revealed no differences for brain activity between sessions ( P &gt; .05). Intraclass correlation coefficients in the sensorimotor regions were good to excellent for average percent signal change (.621 to .918) and Z‐score (.697 to .883), with the exception of the left secondary somatosensory cortex percent signal change (.165). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that a loaded lower extremity force production and attenuation task that simulates the range of motion of squatting, stepping, and landing from a jump is reliable for longitudinal neuroimaging applications and support the use of this paradigm in further studies examining therapeutic interventions and changes in dynamic lower extremity motor function.","This paper presents a novel neuroimaging paradigm designed to evaluate brain activation related to lower extremity motor control during unilateral leg presses.

Comparison of the Angular Compartment of Hip Flexion Before and After Training in 11 to 12-Year-old Soccer Players.,2019-07-02,,,,"An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is an important cause of rest in athletes. In most cases, ACL injuries do not require external contact and they are associated with biomechanical risk factors that increase ACL tension. The increase of the hip flexion angle (HF) is included within these. The ACL requires cooperation of the periarticular musculature of the knee, muscle groups, hip stabilizers and CORE muscles; consequently, fatigue caused by exercise would alter the balance and put this ligament at risk. The objective of the study is to determine the angular behavior for HF before and after a physical load (a standardized training) in children between 11 and 12 years old. A non-randomized clinical study was carried out. The sample consisted of 50 soccer school students born between 11 and 12 years old. The angular behavior of HF was compared before and after performing a training session. The angular behavior was measured through the Drop Jump test (DJ), with data obtained by inertial sensors. After the exercise, there was a significant increase in HF. It was concluded that the angular behavior of HF increases significantly in both extremities after training and that preventive measures must be applied for neuromuscular control of the hip.","This paper investigates the change in the hip flexion angle (HF) in 11 to 12-year-old soccer players before and after a standardized training session. The findings indicate a significant increase in HF post-training, emphasizing the need for preventive measures to enhance neuromuscular control and reduce the risk of ACL injuries."
Hip Angle Behavior in Landing After Drop Jump in Children; and their Implicance in Prevention Programs,2019-07-02,,,,"Background The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is uncommon, but constitutes an important percentage of the lesions requiring more than 8 weeks of recovery in sports. Most ACL injuries do not require external contact and are associated with biomechanical risk factors that stress this ligament ACL: like an increase in knee valgus angle (KV) and hip flexion (HF) and a decreased in knee flexion (KF). The ACL requires muscle cooperation to resist the load; however, when there is fatigue, the protective capacity of the musculature would decrease. The objective of the study is to analyze the angular behavior before and after a physical load for HF in children of 14-15 years old. Hypothesis The physical load applied in a single training session is enough to change some biomechanical risk factors of ACL injury. Study Design Experimental study Level of Evidence 2b Methods The sample consisted of 50 students from different soccer schools between 14-15 years old. We analyzed the hip angular behavior of hip flexion before and after a training session. The angles where obtained from inertioal sensor while the students performed a Drop Jump test from a 30 centimeters drawer. Results Statistically significant differences were found in the differences between pre physical load HF / post-load HF (p = 0.00053), right pre physical load HF / right post- load HF (p = 0.0086) and left post- load (p = 0.0248206). Conclusions It was concluded that the angular behavior of HF increases significantly in both post-training limbs, after performing a physical load. Clinical Relevance This study analyzed the importance of using prevention injury programs since early stages, and give importance to the eccentric role of hamstring, gluteus and core exercises.","The paper investigates the hip angle behavior in children aged 14-15 during landing after drop jumps and its implications for ACL injury prevention. Key findings indicate significant changes in hip flexion angles before and after physical load during training, emphasizing the need for early-stage injury prevention programs that focus on strengthening specific muscle groups."
An Anterior Cruciate Ligament Failure Mechanism,2019-07-01,,,,"Background: Nearly three-quarters of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur as “noncontact” failures from routine athletic maneuvers. Recent in vitro studies revealed that repetitive strenuous submaximal knee loading known to especially strain the ACL can lead to its fatigue failure, often at the ACL femoral enthesis. Hypothesis: ACL failure can be caused by accumulated tissue fatigue damage: specifically, chemical and structural evidence of this fatigue process will be found at the femoral enthesis of ACLs from tested cadaveric knees, as well as in ACL explants removed from patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: One knee from each of 7 pairs of adult cadaveric knees were repetitively loaded under 4 times–body weight simulated pivot landings known to strain the ACL submaximally while the contralateral, unloaded knee was used as a comparison. The chemical and structural changes associated with this repetitive loading were characterized at the ACL femoral enthesis at multiple hierarchical collagen levels by employing atomic force microscopy (AFM), AFM–infrared spectroscopy, molecular targeting with a fluorescently labeled collagen hybridizing peptide, and second harmonic imaging microscopy. Explants from ACL femoral entheses from the injured knee of 5 patients with noncontact ACL failure were also characterized via similar methods. Results: AFM–infrared spectroscopy and collagen hybridizing peptide binding indicate that the characteristic molecular damage was an unraveling of the collagen molecular triple helix. AFM detected disruption of collagen fibrils in the forms of reduced topographical surface thickness and the induction of ~30- to 100-nm voids in the collagen fibril matrix for mechanically tested samples. Second harmonic imaging microscopy detected the induction of ~10- to 100-µm regions where the noncentrosymmetric structure of collagen had been disrupted. These mechanically induced changes, ranging from molecular to microscale disruption of normal collagen structure, represent a previously unreported aspect of tissue fatigue damage in noncontact ACL failure. Confirmatory evidence came from the explants of 5 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, which exhibited the same pattern of molecular, nanoscale, and microscale structural damage detected in the mechanically tested cadaveric samples. Conclusion: The authors found evidence of accumulated damage to collagen fibrils and fibers at the ACL femoral enthesis at the time of surgery for noncontact ACL failure. This tissue damage was similar to that found in donor knees subjected in vitro to repetitive 4 times–body weight impulsive 3-dimensional loading known to cause a fatigue failure of the ACL. Clinical Relevance: These findings suggest that some ACL injuries may be due to an exacerbation of preexisting hierarchical tissue damage from activities known to place larger-than-normal loads on the ACL. Too rapid an increase in these activities could cause ACL tissue damage to accumulate across length scales, thereby affecting ACL structural integrity before it has time to repair. Prevention necessitates an understanding of how ACL loading magnitude and frequency are anabolic, neutral, or catabolic to the ligament.","This paper investigates the failure mechanisms of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), specifically focusing on how repetitive submaximal knee loading can lead to tissue fatigue and subsequent failure, particularly at the femoral enthesis. Analysis of cadaveric knees and patient explants using advanced microscopy techniques revealed molecular and structural damage in collagen, suggesting that ACL injuries may result from accumulated fatigue damage rather than acute trauma, highlighting the importance of managing ACL loading during athletic activities."
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk by Season Period and Competition Segment: An Analysis of National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Data,2019-07-01,,,,"Context Although fatigue has been implicated in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, few researchers have examined the timing of injury across a competitive sport season or within a competitive session to gain insight into the potential effects of fatigue on the incidence of ACL injury. Objective To identify the time segments across a competitive season or within an individual competition associated with the greatest ACL injury incidence. Design Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods Data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program for 2004–2005 through 2015–2016 for basketball, lacrosse, and soccer were analyzed. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) compared ACL injury rates by sport, sex, season segment, and competition period. Poisson regression was used to examine the associations between each of these categories and the incidence of ACL injury as well as interaction effects. Results During the early regular season, the incidence rate was elevated relative to the preseason (IRR = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27, 2.74), middle regular season (IRR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.15), late regular season (IRR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.27), and postseason (IRR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.06, 4.56). A sport-by-season interaction indicated this effect was largely attributable to a higher incidence in the early season among lacrosse athletes. An interaction between season segment and competition period (P = .02) revealed a greater injury incidence before halftime in the early regular season (IRR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.76), but a greater incidence after halftime in the late regular season (IRR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.15, 5.02). Fewer noncontact injuries occurred in soccer than in basketball or lacrosse. Conclusions The ACL injury incidence was higher in the early part of the regular season, particularly among lacrosse athletes. Although the injury incidences before and after halftime were similar, further analyses of player time and time of injury within each half are necessary. Coaches and practitioners should be cognizant of the elevated injury incidence during the early season among lacrosse athletes. Future authors should consider more specific analyses to further elucidate the potential role of fatigue development in exacerbating the incidence of ACL injury in collegiate athletes both within games and across the season.","This paper analyzes the timing of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries throughout a competitive season in collegiate athletes, using data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program. The findings indicate a higher incidence of ACL injuries during the early regular season, particularly among lacrosse players, and reveal noteworthy patterns related to injury occurrences before and after halftime in matches."
Abnormal Motor Response Associated With Concussive Injuries: Biomechanical Comparison Between Impact Seizures and Loss of Consciousness,2019-07-01,,,,"Loss of consciousness (LOC) and impact seizures associated with concussion represent different clinical presentations of concussion; however, they are often investigated and treated similarly. The biomechanical parameters differentiating these 2 distinct signs of injury are poorly described.To differentiate between cases of concussions with LOC and those with impact seizures by comparing the impact velocity, peak linear and peak rotational acceleration, as well as brain tissue deformation in the cerebral cortex, white matter, brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and corpus callosum.Descriptive laboratory study.Elite American football players who sustained an LOC (n = 20) or impact seizures (n = 21).Impact velocity, peak linear and peak rotational acceleration, maximum principal strain, cumulative strain damage measure at 10%, and strain rate (SR).The SR in the cerebral white matter was greater in the LOC group than in the impact-seizure group. Similar trends were observed for SRs in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and corpus callosum. No differences were present between groups for the other variables in this study.A lower SR in certain brain regions helps to explain why motor function is preserved and can be observed in patients with impact seizures versus LOC from concussive injuries.","This paper investigates the biomechanical differences between loss of consciousness (LOC) and impact seizures in concussive injuries among elite American football players. Key findings indicate that the strain rate in cerebral white matter is higher in the LOC group, which may help explain the preserved motor function observed in patients experiencing impact seizures."
Proximal Adductor Avulsion: A Biomechanical Comparison of Suture Anchor Repair Techniques,2019-07-01,,,,"Objectives: Acute avulsion of the proximal fibrocartilaginous origin of the adductor longus (AL) is an injury mostly occurring in individuals that perform cutting and rapid lateral movements such as in hockey, soccer, and rugby. Especially in competitive athletes, recent trends have advocated for surgical repair of these acute injuries. However, while multiple repair configurations have been proposed, the current literature lacks biomechanical data to guide surgical technique. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine load-to-failure values for two proximal adductor repair techniques and to compare their strength to that of a native, uninjured proximal adductor tendon. Methods: Seventeen cadaveric fresh frozen pelvic specimens were dissected to preserve the proximal adductor tendon and the fibrocartilage attachment to the pubis. The specimens were then divided into three groups: an intact AL tendon(baseline control), and ‘torn’ tendons repaired with either a 2-suture anchor or 4-suture anchor technique. Once repaired, specimens were cyclically loaded on a custom jig to simulate a maximal effort soccer-style kick. Testing endpoints included suture anchor pull-out, loss of clamp fixation, or catastrophic tendon failure. To control for individual differences, values were reported both in terms of gross force and as load-to-displacement ratios. Following collection, data from each of the three groups were recorded and analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and multiple comparison tests. Results: The mean load to failure for the 4-anchor group was 83.74±19.28 N, which was significantly greater than for either the intact (25.43±3.46 N, p &lt;0.05) or 2-anchor repair (20.58±1.33 N, p &lt;0.001) conditions. All intact and 4-anchor repair specimens failed via disruption distal to the adductor’s musculotendinous junction, with no failure at the bone-anchor interface noted in either of these groups. In contrast, 80% of 2-anchor repairs failed at the bone to anchor interface. In this group, following initial pullout, failure of a secondary anchor occurred with 41.4% less force than for the index failure (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study provides biomechanical data which identifies a 4-anchor repair as being much more resistant to surgical-site failure than a 2-anchor construct. Further, the 4-anchor group failed at the same anatomic location as the intact adductor group, suggesting that a 4-anchor construct results in a repair that acts similar to an uninjured control. Based on this finding, a 4-anchor repair construct should be preferentially used in proximal adductor repair whenever clinically feasible. [Figure: see text][Figure: see text]","The paper investigates the biomechanical performance of two surgical repair techniques for acute proximal adductor tendon avulsions, particularly in athletes engaged in sports like soccer. Findings indicate that a 4-suture anchor repair significantly outperforms a 2-suture anchor repair in terms of load-to-failure strength, suggesting a preference for the 4-anchor technique in clinical applications."
Comparing the Knee Joint Kinematic Parameters During Landing at Different Minutes of Soccer Game,2019-06-30,,,,"Objective Background The present research aimed to compare landing kinematics parameters at different minutes of a simulated soccer game.Methods In total, 15 soccer players from the youth team of Sanay Mes of Kerman with records (2 years) in the Premier League of Iran voluntarily participated in this study.Their Mean±SD age and weight were 25.7±2.71years and 77.30±7.78kg, respectively.The players followed the Bangsbo's fatigue protocol, i.e. a simulated soccer game.Then, every 15 minutes, the studied players performed two countermovement jumps, and we compared their landing kinematics parameters accordingly.Performances were recorded with 3 cameras, 120 HTZ (Sony A7S).Information extracted from Kinova and repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for data analysis. ResultsThe obtained results suggested significant differences between the investigated players' knee flexion at landing at minute 0 and minute 60, and other durations (P<0.05).Moreover, there were significant differences between dominant leg knee valgus at minutes 0, 60, and 105, and other durations.No differences were detected between the non-dominant leg knee valgus at different minutes of the game.Conclusion The obtained data revealed that minutes 0, 60, and 105 of a simulated soccer game are dangerous times for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury in landing task.Moreover, the biomechanics of the dominant leg in the landing tasks demonstrate more changes than the non-dominant leg.Furthermore, ACL injury in the dominant leg is more frequent than the non-dominant one.","The paper investigates knee joint kinematic parameters during landing at various intervals in a simulated soccer game. It highlights significant differences in knee flexion and valgus angles at specific game minutes, suggesting that these times may pose a greater risk for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries, particularly for the dominant leg."
Lower Extremity Biomechanics Are Altered Across Maturation in Sport-Specialized Female Adolescent Athletes,2019-06-28,,,,"Sport specialization, which may be considered year-round training in a single sport, is a growing trend in youth athletes. Early sport specialization may contribute to injury risk. The dynamic effects of maturation on reduced neuromuscular control may be amplified in young athletes who specialize in a single sport. The purpose of this study was to investigate if sport specialization is associated with increased proliferation of aberrant biomechanics during maturational development in adolescent female athletes. Seventy-nine sport-specialized female adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball athletes were identified and matched with seventy-nine multi-sport (soccer, basketball, and volleyball) female athletes from a database of 1116 female adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball athletes who were enrolled in one of two large prospective, longitudinal studies. The athletes were assessed over two visits in which they were classified as pre-maturational and post-maturational, respectively. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to compare sport-specialized and multi-sport groups and dominant/non-dominant limbs with respect to maturational changes in peak sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane joint angular measures and joint moments of force for the hip and knee joints over the two visits. Kinematic changes through maturation showed no significant interaction with the group × limb and the main effects of group or limb (all p > .05). Kinetic changes through maturation showed no significant interaction with the group × limb and the main effect of limb (both p > .05). The main effect of group was significant (F(6, 152) = 3.196, p = .005). The sport-specialized group sustained a smaller increase in peak knee extensor moment than the multi-sport group (F(1, 157) = 5.658, p = .018) and exhibited a larger increase in peak knee abduction moment (F(1, 157) = 5.790, p = .017) when compared to the multi-sport group. Sport-specialized female athletes exhibited altered biomechanics during landing while performing the DVJ task compared to multi-sport athletes through maturation, which may play a role in injury risk profiles of sport-specialized female athletes.","The paper investigates the impact of sport specialization on juvenile female athletes' lower extremity biomechanics across different maturation stages. It finds that sport-specialized athletes demonstrate altered landing biomechanics, specifically a reduced increase in peak knee extensor moments and an elevated knee abduction moment compared to multi-sport athletes, which could contribute to higher injury risk."

Comparison of Drop Jump and Tuck Jump Knee Joint Kinematics in Elite Male Youth Soccer Players: Implications for Injury Risk Screening,2019-06-25,,,,"Despite the popularity of jump-landing tasks being used to identify injury risk factors, minimal data currently exist examining differences in knee kinematics during commonly used bilateral jumping tasks. This is especially the case for rebounding-based protocols involving young athletes.To compare the frontal plane projection angles (FPPAs) during the drop vertical jump (DVJ) and tuck jump assessment (TJA) in a cohort of elite male youth soccer players of varying maturity status.A total of 57 male youth soccer players from an English championship soccer club participated in this study. Participants performed 3 trials of the DVJ and TJA, during which movement was recorded with 2-dimensional video cameras. FPPA for both right (FPPA-r) and left (FPPA-l) legs, with values <180° indicative of medial knee displacement.On a whole-group level, FPPA-r (172.7° [7.4°] vs 177.2° [11.7°]; P < .05; effect size [ES] = 0.46) and FPPA-l (173.4° [7.3°] vs 179.2° [11.0°]; P < .05; ES = 0.62) were significantly greater for both limbs in the TJA compared with the DVJ; however, these differences were less consistent when grouped by maturity status. FPPA-r during the TJA was significantly and moderately greater in the circa-peak height velocity (PHV) group compared with the post-PHV cohorts (169.4° [6.4°] vs 175.3° [7.8°]; P < .05; ES = 0.49). Whole-group data showed moderate relationships for FPPA-r and FPPA-l between the TJA and DVJ; however, stronger relationships were shown in circa- and post-PHV players compared with the pre-PHV cohort.Considering that the TJA exposed players to a larger FPPA and was sensitive to between-group differences in FPPA-r, the TJA could be viewed as a more suitable screen for identifying FPPA in young male soccer players.","This paper examines the differences in knee joint kinematics during two jump-landing tasks, the drop vertical jump (DVJ) and the tuck jump assessment (TJA), in elite male youth soccer players. The study finds that the TJA resulted in greater frontal plane projection angles (FPPAs), suggesting it may be a more effective tool for screening injury risk in young athletes, particularly as it reveals significant differences across maturity status."
Effect of the FIFA 11+ on Landing Patterns and Baseline Movement Errors in Elite Male Youth Soccer Players,2019-06-25,,,,"There is no evidence regarding the effect of the FIFA 11+ on landing kinematics in male soccer players, and few studies exist regarding the evaluating progress of interventions based on the initial biomechanical profile.To investigate the effect of the FIFA 11+ program on landing patterns in soccer players classified as at low or high risk for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries.Randomized controlled trial.Field-based functional movement screening performed at the soccer field.A total of 24 elite male youth soccer players participated in this study.The intervention group performed the FIFA 11+ program 3 times per week for 8 weeks, whereas the control group performed their regular warm-up program.Before and after the intervention, all participants were assessed for landing mechanics using the Landing Error Scoring System. Pretraining Landing Error Scoring System scores were used to determine risk groups.The FIFA 11+ group had greater improvement than the control group in terms of improving the landing pattern; there was a significant intergroup difference (F1,20 = 28.86, P < .001, ηp2=.591). Soccer players categorized as being at high risk displayed greater improvement from the FIFA 11+ program than those at low risk (P = .03). However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of risk category following the routine warm-up program (P = 1.000).The present study provides evidence of the usefulness of the FIFA 11+ program for reducing risk factors associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The authors' results also suggest that soccer players with the higher risk profile would benefit more than those with lower risk profiles and that targeting them may improve the efficacy of the FIFA 11+ program.","The paper investigates the impact of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program on landing patterns in elite male youth soccer players at varying risk levels for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Young Female Athletes: Patellar Versus Hamstring Tendon Autografts,2019-06-24,,,,"Background: Female athletes are 2 to 8 times more prone to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture than males. Furthermore, reinjury to the ipsilateral or contralateral knee can occur in &gt;20% of athletes. Female sex and younger age are known risk factors for graft failure. The optimal graft choice for young females remains unknown and poorly studied. Purpose/Hypothesis: The authors aimed to compare clinical outcomes in young females who underwent ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB) and quadrupled hamstring (HS) autografts. It was hypothesized that no significant differences in outcomes exist between graft choices. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Female patients aged 15 to 25 years who underwent primary ACLR with BTB or HS autograft were included for review. Patients were subdivided into 2 age groups: 15 to 20 years and 21 to 25 years. The occurrence of chondral, meniscal, or ligamentous injury to either knee was recorded for comparison. Results: A total of 256 females were included (BTB, n = 175; HS, n = 81). The majority of patients were between the ages of 15 and 20 years (BTB, 80%; HS, 77.8%). Overall, graft rupture occurred in 23 patients (9%) and contralateral ACL tear occurred in 18 (7%). Subgroup analysis showed that 75% of BTB and 100% of HS graft retears occurred in females aged 15 to 20 years. Within this age group, there was a significantly lower rate of graft ruptures in the BTB group (6.4%) as compared with the HS group (17.5%, P = .02). Allograft augmentation was used in 4 of the 11 HS grafts that retore. When allograft-augmented grafts were excluded, there was no significant difference in graft failure rate between graft choices. Fifteen patients in the BTB group (12%) as opposed to 1 in the HS group (2%) reported extreme difficulty or the inability to kneel on the front of the knee ( P = .04). Conclusion: In females aged 15 to 20 years undergoing ACLR, BTB autograft may lead to fewer graft ruptures than HS autograft. While this difference was not observed in females aged 21 to 25 years, a larger sample may be required to accept the null hypothesis in this age group. BTB autograft significantly increased the risk of kneeling pain as compared with HS regardless of age.","This paper investigates the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in young female athletes, comparing bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) and hamstring (HS) autografts. The study finds that in females aged 15 to 20, BTB autografts result in fewer graft ruptures than HS autografts, while noting a higher risk of kneeling pain associated with BTB grafts."
DIFFERENT METHODS OF FIXATION OF SEMITENDINOSUS GRAFTS IN ARTHROSCOPIC RECONSTRUCTION OF ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT,2019-06-22,,,,"BACKGROUND: The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the most commonly injured ligament in the human body. Earlier treatment of ACL injury was mainly restricted to sportsmen, but has increased over the years because of awareness and accessibility to treatment facilities. Arthroscopic reconstruction is now the gold-standard for the treatment of ACL tear.&#x0D; MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at IPGME &amp; R, Kolkata in the department of Orthopaedics, where forty patients with single knee injury were taken into consideration, the injury being more than two months old, in the age group 20-50 years, with clinically significant knee instabilities and confirmed on MR imaging.&#x0D; RESULTS: This was a prospective randomised study where 95% of the patients were male.

The effects of lower limb wearable resistance on sprint running performance: A systematic review,2019-06-10,,,,"The aim of this review was to examine the literature that has used lower limb wearable resistance (WR) during sprint running. A systematic search was completed to identify acute and longitudinal studies assessing the effects of lower limb WR on sprint running performance from international peer-reviewed journals. The Boolean phrases (limb OR leg OR lower extremity) AND (sprint*) AND (resist* OR weight OR load*) were used to search PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis that reported the acute kinematic and kinetic effects (n = 8), acute performance effects (n = 3), and longitudinal effects (n = 1). Results showed that the WR micro-loading (0.6-5% body mass) significantly increased contact time (2.9-8.9%), decreased step frequency (-1.4 to -3.7%), and slowed total sprint times (0.6-7.4%). Unloaded sprinting immediately following sprints with lower limb WR resulted in no significant change to total sprinting times. One longitudinal training study did not find a significant effect on maximal sprinting speed for non-trained participants. It can be concluded that not all step kinematic variables are affected during sprinting with an added load up to 5% body mass. Therefore, coaches can use lower limb WR to selectively overload certain aspects of sprint running, in particular stride frequency. It also appears that lower limb WR overloads sprint movement velocity and may provide a stimulus to increase horizontal force output, therefore, it may be inferred that lower limb WR has the potential to elicit improved sprinting performance.","This systematic review investigates the impact of lower limb wearable resistance on sprint running performance by analyzing ten studies that assess both acute and longitudinal effects. The findings indicate that micro-loading between 0.6-5% of body mass affects kinematic variables such as contact time and step frequency, suggesting that lower limb wearable resistance may be utilized to selectively enhance certain aspects of sprinting."
Whole-body control of anticipated and unanticipated sidestep manoeuvres in female and male team sport athletes,2019-06-09,,,,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of sex and planning time on spatial and temporal aspects of the whole-body centre of mass (CoM) mechanics during sidestepping performance. Seventeen female and 17 male collegiate team sport athletes completed seven anticipated and seven unanticipated sidestep trials during which three-dimensional CoM data were recorded. Female athletes had a reduced ability to reorient their CoM towards the desired direction of travel (lower medio-lateral and anterior-posterior CoM velocity) than their male counterparts, with reduced medial (closer to stance foot) and increased posterior positioning of CoM relative to the stance foot (p < 0.05). When planning time was limited, female and male athletes performed sidestepping with CoM further from the stance foot (more medial) and more anterior than in the anticipated condition (p < 0.05) at reduced medio-lateral velocities. Sex and condition control strategy differences were evident both in the preparatory phase and the stance phase. The current research draws attention to the foreseen benefits of training athletes, with particular emphasis on females, to direct CoM towards the desired direction of travel in the preparatory and stance phases within temporally constrained situations for improved performance.","This study examines the effects of sex and planning time on the mechanics of whole-body center of mass (CoM) during sidestep maneuvers in male and female team sport athletes. Findings indicate that female athletes exhibit reduced CoM reorientation abilities compared to males, highlighting the need for targeted training strategies to enhance performance in time-constrained situations."

Relationships between Hamstrings-to-Quadriceps Ratio and Variables Describing Countermovement and Drop Jumps,2019-06-02,,,,"The impact of the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio on sport movement performance has not been sufficiently described. However, it seems that in movements involving eccentric-concentric muscular contractions, a higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio should have a positive impact on human movement performance. The present study is aimed at identifying relationships between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables describing countermovement and drop jumps. The study was carried out in a group of 14 female soccer players. The tests were conducted using a Kistler force plate, an SG electrogoniometer, and the Biodex System 4 Pro dynamometer. Each player performed three countermovement jumps (CMJ) and three drop jumps (DJ) from heights of 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm. The peak torques of knee extensors and flexors were measured in isometric conditions and in isokinetic conditions at angular velocities of 30o/s, 60o/s, 90o/s, and 120o/s. Statistically significant relationships were found between the variables that describe CMJ, DJ 15, DJ 30, and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio at some, though not all, of the angular velocities measured. No significant relationships were found between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables that describe DJ 45 and DJ 60. The heights of CMJ, DJ 15, and DJ 30 were increased with higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratios. Analogous relationships were found between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and relative mechanical power during the take-off phase of the CMJ. Significant relationships between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables that describe vertical jump are likely to be observed if adequate angular velocity is used in the measurement of muscle torque.","This paper investigates the relationship between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and performance variables associated with countermovement and drop jumps in female soccer players. It identifies that higher ratios correlate with improved jump performance at certain angular velocities, while noting the absence of significant relationships at higher drop jump heights."
Alterations in Cortical Activation Among Individuals With Chronic Ankle Instability During Single-Limb Postural Control,2019-06-01,,,,"Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is characterized by repetitive ankle sprains and perceived instability. Whereas the underlying cause of CAI is disputed, alterations in cortical motor functioning may contribute to the perceived dysfunction.To assess differences in cortical activity during single-limb stance among control, coper, and CAI groups.Cross-sectional study.Biomechanics laboratory.A total of 31 individuals (10 men, 21 women; age = 22.3 ± 2.4 years, height = 169.6 ± 9.7 cm, mass = 70.6 ± 11.6 kg), who were classified into control (n = 13), coper (n = 7), and CAI (n = 11) groups participated in this study.Participants performed single-limb stance on a force platform for 60 seconds while wearing a 24-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) changes in the supplementary motor area (SMA), precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobe were measured.Differences in averages and standard deviations of HbO2 were assessed across groups. In the CAI group, correlations were analyzed between measures of cortical activation and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) scores.No differences in average HbO2 were present for any cortical areas. We observed differences in the standard deviation for the SMA across groups; specifically, the CAI group demonstrated greater variability than the control (r = 0.395, P = .02; 95% confidence interval = 0.34, 0.67) and coper (r = 0.38, P = .04; 95% confidence interval = -0.05, 0.69) groups. We demonstrated a strong correlation that was significant in the CAI group between the CAIT score and the average HbO2 of the precentral gyrus (ρ = 0.64, P = .02) and a strong correlation that was not significant between the CAIT score and the average HbO2 of the SMA (ρ = 0.52, P = .06).The CAI group displayed large differences in SMA cortical-activation variability. Greater variations in cortical activation may be necessary for similar static postural-control outcomes among individuals with CAI. Consequently, variations in cortical activation for these areas provide evidence for an altered neural mechanism of postural control among populations with CAI.","This paper investigates the differences in cortical activation during single-limb postural control among individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI), comparing their performance to control and coper groups. It reveals that individuals with CAI exhibit greater variability in cortical activation in the supplementary motor area, suggesting an altered neural mechanism impacting postural control."
Pre-Season Bilateral Strength Asymmetries of Professional Soccer Players and Relationship with Non-Contact Injury of Lower Limb in the Season,2019-06-01,,,,"The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between bilateral pre-season strength asymmetries and the injury of the lower limb in the season.Examined group consisted of 227 soccer players playing in the highest league competition in the Czech Republic (age 25.44±8.7,body height=182.1±6.6 cm, body weight=77.5±6.9 kg).We measured the isokinetic strength of the flexors and extensors of the knee by using the Cybex dynamometer Humac Norm at 60 m.s-1 angular speed and then we compared the bilateral asymmetries between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb in knee flexors and extensors.We retrospectively compare the injury to pre-seasonal bilateral strength imbalances between flexors and extensors of the knee.The results show that 65.9% of players who suffered non-contact leg injuries in the season had imbalances in knee extensors between preferred and non-preferred lover limb ≥10% difference before the season and the percentage of injured players with bilateral asymmetry of knee flexors was 67.9%.These results predict that abnormal muscle asymmetry between the lower extremities may be one of the causes of injury in the area of lower extremities.","This study investigates the relationship between pre-season bilateral strength asymmetries in knee flexors and extensors and the incidence of non-contact lower limb injuries in professional soccer players. The findings indicate a significant correlation, revealing that a majority of injured players exhibited strength imbalances of ≥10% in knee extensors and a notable percentage in knee flexors, suggesting that muscle asymmetry may contribute to injury risk."
SOCCER CLEATS WITH BLADE-SHAPED STUDS AND MECHANICAL OVERLOAD IN SOCCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,2019-06-01,,,,"ABSTRACT Soccer cleats with blade-shaped studs promote greater traction on the pitch and can be beneficial for soccer performance. On the other hand, movements with rapid changes of direction, associated with the high traction of soccer cleats, can increase overload and risk of injuries. Given the lack of consensus on the effects of these cleats on mechanical overload during specific soccer movements, the aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of wearing cleats with bladed studs on mechanical overload in soccer. A search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases between October and November 2017. Non-original articles were excluded, as were those not related to soccer or cleats, and those not written in English. Eight articles were included that tested the effects of bladed studs on overload and that used biomechanical tests. The tasks evaluated were: running in a straight line or with changes of direction, and landing of jumps. The resulting joint torque, soil reaction force, electromyography, and plantar pressure were measured. There was no influence of bladed shaped studs on joint torque or on ground reaction force. There was an increase in plantar pressure on the lateral part of the foot in bladed studs compared to Society cleats and running shoes. When compared with round studs, the results were inconclusive for plantar pressure. Round studs, caused greater electromyographic activity in the quadriceps muscles than bladed studs. It was concluded that wearing bladed-stud cleats does not result in greater mechanical overload during running or landing of jumps. Evidence Level I, Systematic Review.","This systematic review investigates the effects of soccer cleats with blade-shaped studs on mechanical overload during soccer movements. The findings indicate that while bladed studs do not significantly influence joint torque or ground reaction forces, they lead to increased plantar pressure on the lateral part of the foot compared to other types of cleats and running shoes."
Three-Week Intensive Neuromuscular Training Improves Postural Control in Professional Male Soccer Players,2019-06-01,,,,"Abstract Introduction. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a short-term, three-week intensive neuromuscular training programme on the postural stability of professional soccer players and to establish whether lower-limb dominance affects one-leg stability. Material and methods. The experimental group consisted of 16 professional male soccer players, and the control group included 20 professional soccer players who did not undergo any additional training. The experimental group was provided with three-stage progressive training twice a day over a three-week period during the preparatory period and then trained twice per week in-season for a period of 5 months. The experimental subjects were evaluated with the use of a stabilographic platform before the programme, 3 weeks into the programme, and finally after 5 months from its commencement. Total centre of pressure (COP) sway path was measured during one leg stance for the dominant and non-dominant leg with eyes open and closed. Results. After three weeks of training, the experimental group showed a significantly shorter COP path for the measurements taken with both open (p &lt; 0.001; η2 = 0.28) and closed eyes (p &lt; 0.05; η2 = 0.09) compared to the initial results. It was found that the training effects were sustained five months into the training programme for the tests with eyes open (p &lt; 0.001) and eyes closed (p &lt; 0.05). The control group, however, showed no such improvement during that time. No differences were found between the limbs in either of the groups. Conclusions. Neuromuscular training can be effective for postural control improvement in professional male soccer players within a short period of time. Leg dominance does not affect one-leg stability.","This paper examines the effects of a three-week intensive neuromuscular training program on postural control in professional male soccer players. The study finds that the training significantly improved postural stability measures, with effects sustained over five months, while also determining that lower-limb dominance does not influence one-leg stability."
INCIDENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES IN SOCCER REFEREES: A THREE-YEAR STUDY,2019-06-01,,,,"ABSTRACT Objectives To determine the incidence and intensity of pain and the areas most affected by injuries with musculoskeletal pain, and the incidence and severity of “injuries defined by time of leave” in games and training of soccer referees in a triennium. Methods An interview was conducted with 257 referees using a web application. With this tool, a monthly evaluation form was sent to the referees with questions that measured the incidence, location, and pain intensity of injuries with complaints of pain and time of leave, severity in games and training in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The numerical pain scale was used to classify the pain intensity of the lesions with pain complaint. Results There was no difference between the years studied in relation to injuries with pain complaints, both in games and in training. Mean values were 37.8/1,000 hours in games and 39.9/1,000 hours in training, with a mean incidence of “ injuries defined by time of leave” of 3.7/1,000 hours in games. The difference was significantly higher in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2014, and in training, the average incidence was 3.5/1,000 hours, with a significantly higher difference in 2012 compared to 2013 and 2014. Conclusion Lesions with pain complaints did not present a significant difference in games compared to training; in the lesions by time of leave, the incidence in games was higher than in training, and the most frequent type of injury was low-degree muscle pain, predominantly in the thigh and triceps surae. Level of Evidence II; Prognostic Study - Investigating the Effect of Patient Characteristics on Disease Outcome.","The paper investigates the incidence and severity of musculoskeletal injuries among soccer referees over a three-year period, focusing on injury locations and pain intensity. It finds that injuries with pain complaints do not significantly differ between games and training, with low-degree muscle pain most commonly affecting the thigh and triceps surae."
Biomechanical Analysis of Head Impacts during Real Time Soccer Play: a Preliminary Study,2019-06-01,,,,"Linear and angular head accelerations are recognized as the foremost mechanisms of head injuries in sports. However, in non-contact sports such as soccer, little is known about onfield head accelerations during soccer play, which limits the understanding of the risk and mechanism of head injury. PURPOSE: To assess the biomechanics underlying the risk of head injury during soccer play. METHODS: An instrumented headband was worn by 8 elite male (M) players (18 ± 0 yrs, 73.7 ± 9.5 kg, 1.73 ± 0.1 m) and 16 amateur female (F) players (24.1± 1.4 yrs, 63.5 ± 7.8 kg, 1.63 ± 0.1 m) during 7 (M) and 9 (F) games of a summer season. Head kinematics of each impact (peak linear and angular accelerations of the head) were grouped as heading techniques or involuntary impacts. Heading techniques were sub-categorized as jump, stable, head rotation or unstable. Involuntary impacts were sub-categorized as player-to-player contact, ball control (feet or chest), running (acceleration or deceleration), change-of-direction, ground impact, unstable or involuntary head-to-ball impact. Head kinematics were subjected to standard descriptive statistics. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare heading techniques and involuntary impacts kinematic. RESULTS: In total 239 head impacts were registered for M and 139 for F. Heading techniques accounted for 92 impacts for M (36g ± 15g; 4175 ± 2517 rad/s2) and 97 for F (33g ± 13g; 3334 ± 1747 rad/s2). Involuntary impacts accounted for 147 impacts for M (20g ± 9g; 1934 ± 1511 rad/s2) and 42 for F (21g ± 11g; 2095 ± 1603 rad/s2). For M and F, the average peak linear and angular accelerations of the head caused by heading techniques were associated with higher values than involuntary impacts (p < 0.05). For both M and F, the most frequent heading technique was the jump and player-to-player contact was the most frequent for involuntary impact. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results show that heading techniques can cause higher values of head accelerations than involuntary impacts and therefore, could cause a higher risk of head injury in two different populations of players. Grant funding: this study was funded using NSERC and FRQNT research grants.","This paper investigates the biomechanics of head impacts in soccer, focusing on the linear and angular accelerations associated with various heading techniques and involuntary impacts during real-time play. The findings reveal higher head accelerations from heading techniques compared to involuntary impacts, suggesting an increased risk of head injury, particularly in elite male and amateur female players."
Effects of Shock Pad and Synthetic Turf on Ankle Biomechanics in a 90° Cutting Movement,2019-06-01,,,,"Shock pad (PAD) is a popular choice underlayment installed under a synthetic turf (TURF) field. The effects of PAD on impact attenuation and injury risks of human movements are still relatively unknown. PURPOSE: To examine impact attenuation related ankle biomechanical characteristics of a 90° cutting movement on synthetic turf with shock pad compared to synthetic turf only. METHODS: Twelve recreational football and soccer players performed five successful trials of 90° cutting movement in each of two approaching speed conditions: 3.0±0.3 (SLOW) and 4.0±0.4 (FAST) m/s on each of TURF and PAD surface conditions. Three-dimensional kinematic and ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected simultaneously. A 2"" monofilament synthetic turf with 1/2"" stitch gauge was used in TURF and PAD conditions. A foam-based shock pad was used in PAD condition. RESULTS: No significant surface main effect or surface by speed interactions were found for any ankle kinematic and kinetic variables and peak GRFs (p > 0.05). Increased peak ankle eversion moment (0.65 vs. 0.84 Nm/kg, p<0.001) and inversion loading range of motion (ROM, 13.7 vs. 18.6 deg, p=0.001) were seen in FAST compared to SLOW. Increases for peak ankle sagittal-plane concentric pushoff power, and frontal-plane eccentric and concentric power were also observed in FAST compared to SLOW. Peak vertical (2.04 vs. 2.31 BW, p=0.023) and medial loading (0.79 vs. 1.11 BW, p=0.002) GRFs were higher in FAST than SLOW. Additionally, peak pushoff medial GRFs were increased from SLOW to FAST (0.91 vs. 1.20 BW, p=0.025), but pushoff vertical GRFs were decreased slightly (2.24 vs. 2.11 BW, p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant differences between TURF and PAD and their interactions for examined ankle and GRF variables suggest that adding a form-based shock pad does not impede cutting performance. These results also seem to indicate there is a neuromuscular accommodation in cutting mechanics on PAD surface, which cannot be reflected loading variables using inverse dynamics. As cutting speed increased, greater increases in medial peak GRFs, and frontal-plane peak ankle moment and ROM were observed compared to those in sagittal-plane, suggesting increased mediolateral loading to ankle complex in fast cut movement. Supported in part by Brock International.","This paper investigates the impact of a shock pad under synthetic turf on ankle biomechanics during a 90° cutting movement in recreational football and soccer players. The findings indicate that while no significant differences in ankle kinematics and ground reaction forces were noted between the turf and shock pad conditions, faster cutting speeds resulted in increased medial peak ground reaction forces and alterations in ankle moments and range of motion."
Effect of FIFA 11+ Training Program on Soccer-Specific Physical Performance and Functional Movement in Collegiate Male Soccer Players: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2019-05-31,,,,"PURPOSE This study aimed to investigate the effects of the FIFA 11+ training program on soccer-specific physical performance and functional movement of collegiate male soccer players. METHODS Twenty healthy male soccer players (age: 20.0±0.7 years, height: 174.2±4.3 cm, weight: 67.3±7.0 kg) participated in this study and were randomly divided into the 11+ training group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The FIFA 11+ training program was incorporated five times a week for 12 weeks and each session took about 20-25 minutes. The control group performed a normal warm-up. Participants' soccer-specific physical performance (10-m and 30-m sprint test, coordination test, arrowhead agility test, and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR test level 1) and functional movement (deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, straight-leg raise, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability) were measured. RESULTS The results showed that the FIFA 11+ training program group showed a significant improvement in the 30-m sprint (p=.027), coordination test (p=.021), and arrowhead agility test (right: p=.009, left: p=.004), but not in the 10-m sprint and Yo-Yo IR test level 1, compared to the control group. Regarding functional movement, the FIFA 11+ training program group showed significantly better deep squat (p=.035), hurdle step (p=.005), rotary stability (p=.005), and total FMS scores (p=.001) than the control group. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that a 12-week FIFA 11+ training program had positive effects on soccer-specific physical performance and functional movement of collegiate male soccer players. Keywords: FIFA 11+ Training Program, Functional movement, Physical performance, Soccer","This study investigates the impact of the FIFA 11+ training program on the physical performance and functional movement of collegiate male soccer players.

Neuromuscular Control of Vertical Jumps in Female Adolescents,2019-05-30,,,,"Poor landing mechanics are considered deficits in neuromuscular control and risk factors for lower extremity injury. The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) has been used to assess the neuromuscular control of landing mechanics for the first landing in a drop vertical jump (DVJ) task. However, the second DVJ landing may provide different results, warranting assessment.(1) LESS scores will differ between first and second DVJ landings across all female participants with (2) greater intraparticipant variability among the second landing compared with the first landing scores.Cross-sectional study.Level 4.A total of 13 gymnasts and 31 softball players (N = 44) performed 3 DVJ trials. The mean ± SD age of 44 female athletes was 16.46 ± 2.59 years. The LESS was scored using 2-dimensional video of each trial.There was a significant difference between the first and second DVJ landings (P < 0.01). All participants demonstrated higher LESS scores (worse landing mechanics) during the second DVJ landing (10.10 ± 2.25) than the first landing (6.97 ± 2.72).The initial landing in a DVJ has been the focus of neuromuscular control studies using the LESS. This study found worse neuromuscular control during the second DVJ landing, which highlights the importance of evaluating landing mechanics beyond the initial landing.LESS analysis of both DVJ landings might improve neuromuscular control screening in female athletes and augment lower extremity and anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programs.","This paper investigates the differences in neuromuscular control during vertical jumps in female adolescents by assessing landing mechanics using the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS). The study finds that participants exhibit worse landing mechanics in the second drop vertical jump landing compared to the first, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation of landing mechanics to enhance injury prevention strategies."
Repetitive subconcussive head impacts and changes in sensory processing for balance control,2019-05-30,,,,"Abstract Background Repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RHI) may be associated with current and future detrimental neurological effects. However, the effects of RHI on sensory processing for balance control is unknown and may have significant clinical implications if athletes are still participating in sport despite impairments. Research Question Are there changes in sensory processing for balance control during standing and walking following RHI? Methods Thirty healthy, adult, amateur soccer players (15 males, 15 females, 21.8±2.8 years, 69.9±11.5 kg, 171.4±8.2 cm) volunteered for the standing balance assessment (i.e., experiment 1). A distinct cohort of twenty healthy, adult, amateur soccer players (10 males, 10 females, 22.3±4.5 years, 70.0±10.5 kg, 170.5±9.8 cm) volunteered for the walking balance assessment (i.e., experiment 2). We used a repeated measures design across three time points (pre-heading, 0-hours post-heading, 24-hours post-heading). Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (i.e., performed 10 soccer headers in 10 minutes) or a control group (i.e., did not perform any soccer heading between sessions). In experiment 1, participants stood in a virtual reality cave while experiencing simultaneous perturbations to their visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems. In experiment 2, participants walked blindfolded along a foam walkway and experienced a vestibular perturbation on the second heel strike of the right foot. Changes in sensory processing were assessed using repeated measures ANOVAs. Results There were no changes in sensory reweighting during experiment 1 and no changes in balance responses to the vestibular stimulus in experiment 2. Significance Although the cumulative effects of RHI may result in later-life cognitive, behavioral, and mood impairments, a single episode of repeated soccer headers does not appear to be associated with acute impairments in sensory processing for balance control.","The paper investigates the impact of repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RHI) on sensory processing related to balance control in soccer players. The findings indicate that a single session of repeated soccer headers does not cause acute impairments in sensory processing for balance during standing or walking, although RHI may have long-term neurological consequences."
Predisposing factors to hamstring neuromuscular deficits—implications for prevention and rehabilitation of hamstring strain injuries: a narrative review,2019-05-29,,,,"Background: Scientific knowledge on hamstring strain injuries (HSI) constantly accumulates for the last 100 years. However HSI still exhibit high injury/re-injury rates and new areas of research must be thoroughly explored. Deficiencies that impact the close relationship between the nervous system and muscle functioning constitute a promising research direction, according to existing literature.Objectives: To outline the often-overlooked factors that pre-dispose to hamstring neuromuscular deficits, with a special emphasis on hamstring strain injury and re-injury.Major Findings: Sensory input impairment, neural tension, fatigue, competitive anxiety and lumbar-pelvic motor control deficit can all induce dysregulations of the hamstring neuromuscular functioning that may be detrimental during high-speed running. They constitute therefore serious risk factors for hamstring strain injury and re-injury.Conclusions: We devised an intervention algorithm including both evaluation procedures and hamstring management plan, by compiling and adjusting the most promising doctrines of the literature reviewed. Further research, such as randomized controlled trials, is required to provide evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of this algorithm for patients in post-HSI recovery or as a preventive approach in the event of high suspicion of re-injury.","This paper reviews the predisposing factors that contribute to neuromuscular deficits affecting the hamstring, emphasizing their role in hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) and re-injuries. Key findings highlight sensory input impairment, neural tension, fatigue, competitive anxiety, and lumbar-pelvic motor control deficits as significant risk factors, leading to the development of an intervention algorithm aimed at improving evaluation and management strategies for HSI prevention and rehabilitation."
The reliability of force-velocity-power profiling during over-ground sprinting in children and adolescents,2019-05-26,,,,"Anaerobic performance in youth has received little attention partly due to the lack of a ""gold-standard"" measurement. However, force-velocity-power (F-v-P) profiling recently showed high reliability and validity in trained adults. Therefore, the aim was to determine the reliability of F-v-P profiling in children and adolescents. Seventy-five children (60 boys, 15 girls; age: 14.1 ± 2.6 years) completed three 30 m sprints. Velocity was measured at 46.875 Hz using a radar device. The F-v-P profile was fitted to a velocity-time curve allowing instantaneous power variables to be calculated. Reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest worthwhile change (SWC). High reliability was evident for absolute peak (Ppeak) and mean power (Pmean), Ppeak and Pmean expressed relative to body mass, peak and mean velocity, 30 m sprint time, peak horizontal force (F0), relative F0, mechanical efficiency index and fatigue rate (ICC: 0.75-0.88; CV: 1.9-9.4%) with time to peak power demonstrating moderate reliability (ICC: 0.50; CV: 9.5%). The F-v-P model demonstrated at least moderate reliability for all variables. This therefore provides a potential alternative for paediatric researchers assessing sprint performance and the underlying kinetics.","This paper investigates the reliability of force-velocity-power profiling during over-ground sprinting in children and adolescents, addressing a gap in the measurement of anaerobic performance in youth. High reliability was established for key performance variables such as peak and mean power, peak velocity, and horizontal force, suggesting the F-v-P model as a viable assessment tool for pediatric sprint performance evaluation."
Long-Term Neurological Consequences Related to Boxing and American Football: A Review of the Literature,2019-05-25,,,,The long-term effects of repetitive head trauma on the brain have often been studied in boxers and American football players. The medical literature on this topic was reviewed in order to compare the findings related to boxing with those related to football. The evidence gathered from this review indicates that there are significant differences between the clinical and neuropathological descriptions of the chronic brain damage reported in retired boxers compared to those reported in retired football players. Differing biomechanics of head impacts in the two sports may help explain the different clinical and neuropathological consequences of participation in boxing versus football.,"This paper reviews the long-term neurological effects of repetitive head trauma in boxers and American football players, highlighting differences in clinical and neuropathological outcomes between the two sports. The findings suggest that the differing biomechanics of head impacts may contribute to the varying consequences of brain damage experienced by participants in boxing compared to football."
Evaluation of skin-mounted sensor for head impact measurement,2019-05-23,,,,"The requirement to measure the number and severity of head impacts in sports has led to the development of many wearable sensors. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability and accuracy of a wearable head impact sensor: xPatch, X2Biosystems, Inc. The skin-mounted sensor, xPatch, was fixed onto a Hybrid III headform and dropped using an impact test rig. A total of 400 impacts were performed, ranging from 20g to 200g linear acceleration, and impact velocities of 1.2 - 3.9 m/s. During each impact, the peak linear acceleration, angular velocity and angular acceleration were recorded and compared to the reference calibrated data. Impacts were also recorded using a high-speed video camera. The results show that the linear acceleration recorded by the xPatch during frontal and side impacts had errors of up to 24% when compared to the referenced data. The angular velocity and angular acceleration had substantially larger errors of up to 47.5% and 57%, respectively. The location of the impact had a significant effect on the results: if the impact was to the side of the head, the device on that side may have an error of up to 71%, thus highlighting the importance of device location. All impacts were recorded using two separate xPatches and, in certain cases, the difference in angular velocity between the devices was 43%. In conclusion, the xPatch can be useful for identifying impacts and recording linear accelerations during front and side impacts, but the rotational velocity and acceleration data need to be interpreted with caution.","The paper evaluates the reliability and accuracy of the xPatch wearable sensor for measuring head impacts in sports, focusing on its performance under various impact conditions. The results indicate that while the xPatch can effectively detect linear accelerations during frontal and side impacts, significant errors in angular measurements highlight the importance of sensor placement."
Influence of the structural components of artificial turf systems on impact attenuation in amateur football players,2019-05-23,,,,"Abstract The purpose of this research was to evaluate the influence of the structural components of different 3rd generation artificial turf football field systems on the biomechanical response of impact attenuation in amateur football players. A total of 12 amateur football players (24.3 ± 3.7 years, 73.5 ± 5.5 kg, 178.3 ± 4.1 cm and 13.7 ± 4.3 years of sport experience) were evaluated on three third generation artificial turf systems (ATS) with different structural components. ATS were composed of asphalt sub-base and 45 mm of fibre height with (ATS1) and without (ATS2) elastic layer or compacted granular sub-base, 60 mm of fibre height without elastic layer (ATS3). Two triaxial accelerometers were firmly taped to the forehead and the distal end of the right tibia of each individual. The results reveal a higher force reduction on ATS3 in comparison to ATS1 (+6.24%, CI95%: 1.67 to 10.92, ES: 1.07; p &lt; 0.05) and ATS2 (+21.08%, CI95%: 16.51 to 25.66, ES: 2.98; p &lt; 0.05) elastic layer. Tibia acceleration rate was lower on ATS3 than ATS1 (−0.32, CI95%: −0.60 to −0.03, ES: 4.23; p &lt; 0.05) and ATS2 (−0.35, CI95%: −0.64 to −0.06; ES: 4.69; p &lt; 0.05) at 3.3 m/s. A very large correlation ( r = 0.7 to 0.9; p &lt; 0.05) was found between energy restitution and fibre height in both head and tibial peak acceleration and stride time. In conclusion, structural components (fibre height, infill, sub-base and elastic layer) determine the mechanical properties of artificial turf fields. A higher force reduction and lower energy restitution diminished the impact received by the player which could protect against injuries associated with impacts compared to harder artificial turf surfaces.","This paper investigates how the structural components of various third-generation artificial turf systems affect impact attenuation for amateur football players. The findings indicate that turf with certain features, such as a higher fiber height and specific sub-base configurations, significantly reduce impact forces and associated injury risks compared to other turf types."
Maximal heart rate assessment in recreational football players: A study involving a multiple testing approach,2019-05-21,,,,"This study aimed at examining the suitability of a standard treadmill test (TT), popular intermittent field tests, and small-sided football matches to induce maximal heart rate (HRmax ) in recreational football players. Sixty-six inactive untrained male subjects (age: 39.3 ± 5.8 years, VO2max : 41.2 ± 6.2 mL kg-1 min-1 , body mass: 81.9 ± 10.8 kg, height: 173.2 ± 6.4 cm) were evaluated. On separate occasions, the players were randomly submitted to a progressive VO2max TT, to the Yo-Yo intermittent endurance level 1 (YYIE1) and level 2 (YYIE2) tests, to the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 (YYIR1) test, and to 7v7 (43 × 27 m pitch, 83 m2 /player) football matches (45 minutes; 2-4 matches/player). To ensure data consistency, exercise HR was recorded using the same HR monitors in all the experimental conditions. A total of 73%, 24%, 18%, 17%, and 30% of the players achieved their HRmax during the YYIE1, YYIE2, YYIR1, TT, and the small-sided football matches, respectively. The probability of achieving HRmax increased proportionally to test duration, with 7.8 minutes as the cutoff time. Variations in HRpeak of ±2 b min-1 should be regarded as of practical relevance. YYIE1 HRpeak provided the most accurate estimation of a subject's individual HRmax and much higher probability of reaching HRmax . Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest caution in considering a reference test for HRmax assessment in this population. The use of confirmation tests is still highly advisable when the test duration is shorter than 7.8 minutes. In this regard, field tests seem to be suitable and accurate for individual HRmax assessment in recreational football players.","This study evaluates different testing methods for determining maximal heart rate (HRmax) in recreational football players, comparing a standard treadmill test to various intermittent field tests and small-sided matches. The findings suggest that while certain tests, particularly the Yo-Yo intermittent endurance level 1, are effective for estimating HRmax, caution is needed when interpreting results from shorter tests, indicating the importance of confirmation tests for accurate assessment."
Risk Factors for Knee Osteoarthritis in Retired Professional Footballers: A Cross-Sectional Study,2019-05-18,,,,"To determine risk factors for 3 knee osteoarthritis (KOA) outcomes, knee pain (KP), radiographic KOA (RKOA), and total knee replacement (TKR) in professional footballers.This was a cross-sectional study involving a postal questionnaire, followed by radiographic assessment in a subcohort of responders.Four thousand seven hundred seventy-five questionnaires were sent to retired professional footballers, who had played in the English football league, and 1207 responded. Of these, 470 underwent knee radiographs.Potential factors include age, body mass index (BMI), knee alignment, a history of football-related knee injury, and training hours (during career) were collected through the questionnaire.Knee osteoarthritis outcomes were current KP (pain for most days of the previous month), TKR (self-reported), and RKOA (observed through radiographs).Football-related injury was the strongest risk factor for KP [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 4.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.26-5.48], RKOA [aOR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.81-4.59], and TKR [aOR, 4.83; 95% CI, 2.87-8.13]. Footballers had a 7% increased risk of RKOA for every 1000 hours trained. Although age and gout were associated with all 3 KOA outcomes, BMI, nodal osteoarthritis (OA), a family history of OA, knee malalignment, and 2D:4D ratio were associated with one or another of these 3 KOA outcomes.This study is the first to examine KOA risk factors in retired professional footballers. The study has identified several risk factors, both specific (eg, knee injury and training dose) and nonspecific (eg, age and gout) to footballers. This may be used to develop prevention strategies to reduce the risk of KOA in professional footballers after retirement.","This study investigates the risk factors for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) in retired professional footballers, focusing on outcomes such as knee pain, radiographic KOA, and total knee replacement. Key findings highlight that football-related injuries, training hours, age, and BMI significantly contribute to the risk of these outcomes, providing insights for preventive strategies for KOA in this population."
Biomechanical comparison of concussions with and without a loss of consciousness in elite American football: implications for prevention,2019-05-17,,,,"Loss of consciousness (LOC) associated with concussion is no longer considered an indicator of severity of injury in concussion management protocols. Studies investigating the association between LOC and recovery time or neurophysiological performance have reported ambiguous findings and resulted in a limited understanding of the severity of LOC-inducing head impacts. Concussive injuries with and without LOC from helmet-to-helmet and shoulder collisions and falls in elite American football were reconstructed in laboratory using a hybrid III headform and finite element model to obtain peak linear and rotational acceleration and brain tissue deformation metrics in the cerebral cortex, the cerebral white matter, the corpus callosum, the thalamus and the brainstem. Impact velocity, peak linear and rotational acceleration were significantly greater in the LOC group than the no LOC group. The brain tissue deformation metrics were greater in the LOC group than the no LOC group. The best overall predictor for LOC was impact velocity. Concussions with LOC are characterised by greater magnitudes of brain tissue deformation. This was mainly the result of higher impact velocities in the LOC group providing league decision-makers with an understanding of the importance of managing impact velocity through athlete education and rule enforcement or change.","This paper investigates the differences in concussion severity between cases with and without loss of consciousness (LOC) in American football, emphasizing the implications for injury prevention. Key findings indicate that concussions with LOC are associated with significantly higher impact velocities and greater brain tissue deformation metrics, suggesting a need for improved management strategies focused on reducing impact velocities."
"The Increased Effectiveness of Loaded Versus Unloaded Plyometric Jump Training in Improving Muscle Power, Speed, Change of Direction, and Kicking-Distance Performance in Prepubertal Male Soccer Players",2019-05-16,,,,"To examine the effects of loaded (LPJT) versus unloaded plyometric jump training (UPJT) programs on measures of muscle power, speed, change of direction (CoD), and kicking-distance performance in prepubertal male soccer players.Participants (N = 29) were randomly assigned to a LPJT group (n = 13; age = 13.0 [0.7] y) using weighted vests or UPJT group (n = 16; age = 13.0 [0.5] y) using body mass only. Before and after the intervention, tests for the assessment of proxies of muscle power (ie, countermovement jump, standing long jump); speed (ie, 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint); CoD (ie, Illinois CoD test, modified 505 agility test); and kicking-distance were conducted. Data were analyzed using magnitude-based inferences.Within-group analyses for the LPJT group showed large and very large improvements for 10-m sprint time (effect size [ES] = 2.00) and modified 505 CoD (ES = 2.83) tests, respectively. For the same group, moderate improvements were observed for the Illinois CoD test (ES = 0.61), 5- and 20-m sprint time test (ES = 1.00 for both the tests), countermovement jump test (ES = 1.00), and the maximal kicking-distance test (ES = 0.90). Small enhancements in the standing long jump test (ES = 0.50) were apparent. Regarding the UPJT group, small improvements were observed for all tests (ES = 0.33-0.57), except 5- and 10-m sprint time (ES = 1.00 and 0.63, respectively). Between-group analyses favored the LPJT group for the modified 505 CoD (ES = 0.61), standing long jump (ES = 0.50), and maximal kicking-distance tests (ES = 0.57), but not for the 5-m sprint time test (ES = 1.00). Only trivial between-group differences were shown for the remaining tests (ES = 0.00-0.09).Overall, LPJT appears to be more effective than UPJT in improving measures of muscle power, speed, CoD, and kicking-distance performance in prepubertal male soccer players.","This paper investigates the comparative effects of loaded versus unloaded plyometric jump training on muscle power, speed, change of direction, and kicking distance in prepubertal male soccer players. The findings suggest that loaded plyometric jump training significantly enhances these performance measures more than unloaded training, with substantial improvements observed in sprint and agility tests."
Effects of Plyometric Versus Optimum Power Load Training on Components of Physical Fitness in Young Male Soccer Players,2019-05-16,,,,"Purpose : The current study aimed to compare the effects of plyometric (PT) versus optimum power load (OPL) training on physical performance of young high-level soccer players. Methods : Athletes were randomly divided into PT (horizontal and vertical drills) and OPL (squat + hip thrust exercises at the load of maximum power output) interventions, applied over 7 weeks during the in-season period. Squat and countermovement jumps, maximal sprint (10 and 30 m), and change of direction (COD; agility t test) were the pretraining and posttraining measured performance variables. Magnitude-based inference was used for within- and between-group comparisons. Results : OPL training induced moderate improvements in vertical squat jump (effect size [ES]: 0.97; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.32–1.61) and countermovement jump (ES: 1.02; 90% CI, 0.46–1.57), 30-m sprint speed (ES: 1.02; 90% CI, 0.09–1.95), and COD performance (ES: 0.93; 90% CI, 0.50–1.36). After PT training method, vertical squat jump (ES: 1.08; 90% CI, 0.66–1.51) and countermovement jump (ES: 0.62; 90% CI, 0.18–1.06) were moderately increased, while small enhancements were noticed for 30-m sprint speed (ES: 0.21; 90% CI, −0.02 to 0.45) and COD performance (ES: 0.53; 90% CI, 0.24–0.81). The 10-m sprint speed possibly increased after PT intervention (small ES: 0.25; 90% CI, −0.05 to 0.54), but no substantial change (small ES: 0.36; 90% CI, −0.40 to 1.13) was noticed in OPL. For between-group analyses, the COD ability and 30-m sprint performances were possibly (small ES: 0.30; 90% CI, −0.20 to 0.81; Δ = +1.88%) and likely (moderate ES: 0.81; 90% CI, −0.16 to 1.78; Δ = +2.38%) more improved in the OPL than in the PT intervention, respectively. Conclusions : The 2 different training programs improved physical performance outcomes during the in-season period. However, the combination of vertically and horizontally based training exercises (squat + hip thrust) at optimum power zone led to superior gains in COD and 30-m linear sprint performances.","The paper compares the effects of plyometric training (PT) and optimum power load training (OPL) on the physical performance of young male soccer players over a 7-week in-season period. Results indicate that while both training methods enhanced performance metrics such as vertical jump and sprint speed, OPL training yielded superior improvements in change of direction and 30-m sprint performances."
Reliability and Validity of an Innovative Device for ACL Testing: The Mobil-Aider™,2019-05-16,,,,"Background : Knee disorders prevalence is estimated at more than 50% in a lifetime. There are over 250,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries per year in the United States. There are over 175,000 ACL reconstructions annually. This study was a double-blinded design to establish the reliability and validity of a new orthopedic device to measure linear translation of the tibia on the femur (ACL testing). Methods : A Zeiss Smartzoom microscope was used as the gold standard to assess the ability of the Mobil-Aider ™ to measure linear translation. Sixty blinded measures were taken with each of 6 different devices. Results : Both the intraclass correlation and the Pearson correlation were .986. The Cronbach alpha reliability analysis was 0.992. Independent 1-sample t tests were performed on the differences between the Mobil-Aider ™ and Zeiss values, and were not found to be significant ( P = .42); that is, they were the same. Bland–Altman plot and a linear regression revealed no propositional bias. Finally, with 360 measures over 6 devices, the power of this study was calculated to be 100%. Discussion : This data are the first step in establishing reliability and concurrent validity of a new device. As a result of the current data, the Mobil-Aider ™ device is deemed a promising orthopedic tool for use in assessing the laxity of the ACL. Additional testing needs to be performed on both healthy and injured knees. Conclusions : There is potential for the Mobil-Aider ™ to contribute to the assessment of ACL injuries, but additional human testing is needed.","The paper investigates the reliability and validity of the Mobil-Aider™, an innovative device designed for measuring the linear translation of the tibia on the femur during ACL testing. The study's findings indicate high correlation and reliability measures, suggesting that the Mobil-Aider™ could be a promising tool for assessing ACL laxity, although further human testing is required."
Maximum acceleration performance of professional soccer players in linear sprints: Is there a direct connection with change-of-direction ability?,2019-05-14,,,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the selective influences of the maximum acceleration capability on change of direction (COD) speed, COD deficit, linear sprint speed, sprint momentum, and loaded and unloaded vertical jump performances in forty-nine male professional soccer players (24.3 ± 4.2 years; 75.4 ± 5.4 kg; 177.9 ± 6.4 cm). Soccer players performed the assessments in the following order: 1) squat and countermovement jumps; 2) 20-m sprinting speed test; 3) Zigzag COD ability test; and 4) bar-power outputs in the jump squat exercise. Athletes were divided, using a median split analysis, into two different groups according to their maximum acceleration rates from zero to 5-m (e.g., higher and lower ACC 0-5-m). Magnitude-based inference was used to compare the differences in the physical test results between ""higher"" and ""lower"" acceleration groups. A selective influence of the maximum acceleration ability on speed-power tests was observed, as the higher acceleration group demonstrated likely to almost certain higher performances than the lower acceleration group in all measurements (effect sizes varying from 0.66 [for sprint momentum in 20-m] to 2.39 [for sprint velocity in 5-m]). Conversely, the higher acceleration group demonstrated a higher COD deficit when compared to the lower acceleration group (ES = 0.55). This indicates compromised efficiency to perform COD maneuvers in this group of players. In summary, it was observed that soccer players with higher maximum acceleration rates are equally able to jump higher, sprint faster (over short distances), and achieve higher COD velocities than their slower counterparts. However, they appear to be less efficient at changing direction, which may be related to their reduced ability to deal with greater entry and exit velocities, or counterbalance the associated mechanical consequences (i.e., greater inertia) of being faster and more powerful.","This study investigates the relationship between maximum acceleration performance and change-of-direction (COD) ability in professional soccer players. Findings reveal that while players with higher acceleration demonstrate superior sprint and jump performance, they exhibit a greater COD deficit, indicating a compromise in efficiency when executing directional changes."
"Does soccer headgear reduce the incidence of sport-related concussion? A cluster, randomised controlled trial of adolescent athletes",2019-05-14,,,,"Background There have been no large randomised controlled trials to determine whether soccer headgear reduces the incidence or severity of sport-related concussion (SRC) in US high school athletes. Objective We aimed to determine whether headgear reduces the incidence or severity (days out from soccer) of SRCs in soccer players. Methods 2766 participants (67% female, age 15.6±1.2) (who undertook 3050 participant years) participated in this cluster randomised trial. Athletes in the headgear (HG) group wore headgear during the season, while those in the no headgear (NoHG) group did not. Staff recorded SRC and non-SRC injuries and soccer exposures. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine time-to-SRC between groups, while severity was compared with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results 130 participants (5.3% female, 2.2% male) sustained an SRC. The incidence of SRC was not different between the HG and NoHG groups for males (HR: 2.00 (0.63–6.43) p=0.242) and females (HR: 0.86 (0.54–1.36) p=0.520). Days lost from SRC were not different (p=0.583) between the HG group (13.5 (11.0–018.8) days) and the NoHG group (13.0 (9.0–18.8) days). Conclusions Soccer headgear did not reduce the incidence or severity of SRC in high school soccer players. Trial registration number NCT02850926 .","This paper investigates whether soccer headgear effectively reduces the incidence and severity of sport-related concussions (SRC) among high school athletes. The study, involving 2,766 participants, found no significant difference in SRC incidence or days lost between the headgear group and the control group, concluding that headgear does not mitigate SRC risk or severity in this population."
Evaluation of head impact exposure measured from youth football game plays,2019-05-10,,,,"OBJECTIVE There is a growing body of literature informing efforts to improve the safety of football; however, research relating on-field activity to head impacts in youth football is limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare head impact exposure (HIE) measured in game plays among 3 youth football teams. METHODS Head impact and video data were collected from athletes (ages 10–13 years) participating on 3 youth football teams. Video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each to a specific play type. Each play was categorized as a down, punt, kickoff, field goal, or false start. Kickoffs and punts were classified as special teams. Downs were classified as running, passing, or other. HIE was quantified by play type in terms of mean, median, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration. Mixed-effects models were used to assess differences in acceleration among play types. Contact occurring on special teams plays was evaluated using a standardized video abstraction form. RESULTS A total of 3003 head impacts over 27.5 games were analyzed and paired with detailed video coding of plays. Most head impacts were attributed to running (79.6%), followed by passing (14.0%), and special teams (6.4%) plays. The 95th percentile linear acceleration measured during each play type was 52.6 g , 50.7 g , and 65.5 g , respectively. Special teams had significantly greater mean linear acceleration than running and passing plays (both p = 0.03). The most common kick result on special teams was a deep kick, of which 85% were attempted to be returned. No special teams plays resulted in a touchback, and one resulted in a fair catch. One-third of all special teams plays and 92% of all nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate a trend toward higher head impact magnitudes on special teams than for running and passing plays, but a greater number of impacts were measured during running plays. Deep kicks were most common on special teams, and many returned and nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. These results support policy changes to youth special teams plays, including modifying the yard line the ball is kicked from and coaching proper return technique. Further investigation into biomechanical exposure measured during game impact scenarios is needed to inform policy relevant to the youth level.","This paper evaluates head impact exposure (HIE) in youth football by comparing the impact magnitudes across different types of game plays. The study finds that while most impacts occur during running plays, special teams exhibit significantly higher mean linear acceleration, suggesting the need for policy modifications in youth football to enhance player safety."
Acute and chronic effects of competition on ankle dorsiflexion ROM in professional football players,2019-05-09,,,,"The aim of this study was to investigate the acute (a football match) and chronic (a whole season) effects of competition on ankle dorsiflexion ROM in professional football players. Forty football players participated in this study. Ankle dorsiflexion ROM was recorded to examine acute (pre-match, immediately post-match and 48 h post-match) and chronic (pre-season, mid-season and post-season) effects of competitive football. In addition, it was found that players had restricted mobility measures on ankle dorsiflexion as >2 cm change between baseline measures (pre-match and pre-season). The training load of all played matches was estimated using a global positioning system (GPS) and RPE. Pre-season ankle dorsiflexion ROM was greater compared to mid-season (8.1% in the dominant, and 9.6% in the non-dominant leg) and post-season (13.8% in the dominant, and 12.5% in the non-dominant leg). In addition, around 30% of all players showed restricted ankle dorsiflexion ROM values in post-season compared with pre-season. Related to acute effects, ankle dorsiflexion ROM increased after a match (5.8%) in the dominant ankle, and this value decreased (2.65%) 48 h post-match when post-match measurements in both dominant and non-dominant ankles were compared. The progressive decrease in ankle dorsiflexion ROM throughout a season can be an indicator of increased risk of injury and may be reinforce the need of prevention actions such as stretching exercises and eccentric strength training in professional football players. In addition, these findings suggest to implement specific recovery strategies aiming at minimizing alteration in ankle dorsiflexion ROM 48 h post-match.","This study investigates the acute and chronic effects of competition on ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) in professional football players. Findings indicate a progressive decrease in ankle dorsiflexion ROM throughout the season, highlighting potential injury risks and the necessity for recovery strategies, such as stretching and eccentric strength training."
Influence of Whole-Body Electrostimulation on the Deformability of Density-Separated Red Blood Cells in Soccer Players,2019-05-09,,,,"Red blood cell nitric oxide synthase (RBC-NOS) dependent NO production positively affects RBC deformability which is known to improve oxygen supply to the working tissue. Whole-body electrostimulation (WB-EMS) has been shown to improve maximum strength, sprinting and jumping performance, and to increase deformability in elite soccer players during the season. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether WB-EMS affects RBC turnover which might affect overall deformability of circulating RBC by rejuvenation of the RBC population and if this might be related to improved endurance capacity. Thirty male field soccer players were assigned in either a WB-EMS group (EG, n=10), a training group (TG, n=10) or a control group (CG, n=10). EG performed 3 x 10 squat jumps superimposed with WB-EMS twice per week in concurrent to 2-4 soccer training sessions and one match per week. TG only performed 3 x 10 squat jumps without EMS in addition to their soccer routine and the control group only performed the usual soccer training and match per week. Subjects were tested before (Baseline) and in week 7 (wk-7), with blood sampling before (Pre), 15-30min after (Post) and 24h after (24h post) the training. Endurance capacity was determined before and directly after the training period. The key findings of the investigation indicate an increase in young RBC in the EG group along with improved overall RBC deformability, represented by decreased SS1/2:EImax Ratio. Analysis of the different RBC subfractions revealed improved RBC deformability of old RBC during study period. This improvement was not only observed in the EG but also in TG and CG. Changes in RBC deformability were not associated to altered RBC-NOS/NO signalling pathway. Endurance capacity remained unchanged during study period. In summary, the effect of WB-EMS on RBC physiology seems to be rather low and results are only in part comparable to previous findings. According to the lower training volume of the present study it can be speculated that the soccer specific training load in addition to the WB-EMS was too low to induce changes in RBC physiology.","The paper investigates the impact of whole-body electrostimulation (WB-EMS) on the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs) and its potential relationship with endurance capacity in soccer players. The study found that while WB-EMS led to an increase in young RBCs and improved overall RBC deformability, these changes were minimal and not directly related to the RBC-NOS/NO signaling pathway or endurance improvements, suggesting that the training load may have been insufficient to affect RBC physiology significantly."
Head and Neck Response of an Active Human Body Model and Finite Element Anthropometric Test Device During a Linear Impactor Helmet Test,2019-05-06,,,,"It has been proposed that neck muscle activation may play a role in head response resulting from impacts in American Football. The importance of neck stiffness and active musculature in the standard linear impactor helmet test was assessed using a detailed head and neck finite element (FE) model from a current human body model (HBM) compared to a validated hybrid III head and neck FE model. The models were assessed for bare-head and helmeted impacts at three speeds (5.5, 7.4, and 9.3 m/s) and three impact orientations. The HBM head and neck was assessed without muscle activation and with a high level of muscle activation representing a braced condition. The HBM and hybrid III had an average cross-correlation rating of 0.89 for acceleration in the primary impact direction, indicating excellent correspondence regardless of muscle activation. Differences were identified in the axial head acceleration, attributed to axial neck stiffness (correlation rating of 0.45), but these differences did not have a large effect on the overall head response using existing head response metrics (head injury criteria, brain injury criteria, and head impact power). Although responses that develop over longer durations following the impact differed slightly, such as the moment at the base of the neck, this occurred later in time, and therefore, did not considerably affect the short-term head kinematics in the primary impact direction. Though muscle activation did not play a strong role in the head response for the test configurations considered, muscle activation may play a role in longer duration events.","This paper evaluates the role of neck muscle activation and stiffness in head response during helmet tests for American Football using finite element models. The findings suggest that while muscle activation has minimal influence on short-term head kinematics during impacts, it may affect responses over longer durations."
Biomechanical evaluation of different ankle orthoses in a simulated lateral ankle sprain in two different modes,2019-05-06,,,,"Abstract Ankle orthoses are commonly used for prevention of recurrent ankle sprains. While there are some data on their functional performance or restriction of range of motion, there is little knowledge on the quantifiable passive mechanical effectiveness of various devices. This study aimed to determine the prophylactic stabilization effect for commonly prescribed ankle orthoses in a simulated recurrent ankle sprain. Eleven anatomic lower leg specimens were tested in plantar flexion and hindfoot inversion in a simulated ankle sprain in a quasi‐static and dynamic test mode at 0.5°/s and 50°/s internal rotation, respectively. Tests included intact specimens, same specimens with the ruptured anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), followed by stabilization with five different semi‐rigid orthoses: AirGo Ankle Brace, Air Stirrup Ankle Brace, Dyna Ankle 50S1, MalleoLoc, and Aequi. Compared to the injured and unprotected state, two orthoses (AirGo and Air Stirrup) significantly reinforced the ankle. The Aequi ankle brace restored stability comparable to an intact joint. Dyna Ankle 50S1 and MalleoLoc provided insufficient resistance to applied internal rotation compared to the ankle with ruptured ATFL. Ankle orthoses varied significantly in their ability to stabilize the unstable ankle during an ankle sprain in both testing modes. Presented objective data on passive stabilization reveal a lack of supporting evidence for clinical application of ankle orthoses.","This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various ankle orthoses for stabilizing the ankle during simulated lateral ankle sprains. The study finds that while some orthoses significantly reinforce the ankle stability, others do not provide adequate support, highlighting a need for evidence-based guidelines on the clinical use of these devices."
Asymmetry between the dominant and non-dominant legs in the lower limb biomechanics during single-leg landings in females,2019-05-01,,,,"This study aims to determine the effects of asymmetry on kinematics, kinetics, and changes in the center of pressure of the dominant and non-dominant legs during single-leg landings in female athletes. Fifteen healthy female collegiate soccer players performed dominant and non-dominant single-leg landings from a height of 40 cm. The three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremities were collected simultaneously with a 16-camera motion capture system and one force platform, respectively. Moreover, joint angle, joint range of motion, ground reaction force, joint moment, center-of-pressure, and absolute symmetry index (ASI%) were analyzed. Results corroborated that the range of motion in the knee and hip joints were significantly lower in the non-dominant than in the dominant leg. Meanwhile, the non-dominant leg exhibited higher medial–lateral center-of-pressure displacement than did the dominant leg. In addition, the ASI% for the peak ground reaction force and the loading rate exceeded 10% (peak ground reaction force: 11.31%, loading rate: 19.28%), which indicated asymmetry between the two legs during the single-leg landing impact. The findings also imply that for the female soccer players, the risk of injury (e.g. anterior cruciate ligament injury) can be higher in the non-dominant than in the dominant leg during unilateral dynamic movements.","This study investigates the biomechanical asymmetry between the dominant and non-dominant legs in female soccer players during single-leg landings. Key findings indicate that the non-dominant leg showed reduced range of motion and greater medial-lateral center-of-pressure displacement, suggesting a higher risk of injury during unilateral movements."
Passive cervical spine ligaments provide stability during head impacts,2019-05-01,,,,"It has been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatory cocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantify the relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head stabilization using an OpenSim musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle and ligaments during head impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase, active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase, active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limit the effectiveness of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.","This paper investigates the role of passive cervical spine ligaments in stabilizing the head during head impacts in American football, emphasizing the quantification of angular impulse contributions using a musculoskeletal model. The findings reveal that while active musculature plays a significant role in head stabilization during mild experimental impacts, passive ligaments are crucial during football impacts, especially during high-speed deceleration, underscoring their importance in head injury prevention strategies."
The epidemiological profile of knee injury pattern among different divisional football players,2019-05-01,,,,"The complete scenario of number and factors of knee injuries among the male footballers is intangible; therefore, it would seem essential to compute the injuries in relation to field condition and to show the nature and type of injuries including the possible risk factors. In a total of 200 of 215 soccer athletes playing at least one year professionally were randomized with the age range 14 - 40 years recruited from different divisional clubs. All information collected through questionnaires from five football clubs who were participating in the tournament from March 2011 to February 2012. In total, from 200 players, 116 of them suffered soft tissue injuries (29 per 100 players) in the knee on average 27 years of age. A higher percentage of injury explored in midfielder 35.5%, and the ligament was the most common 63.8% soft tissue injury. 59% participant noted about lack of a particular exercise regimen for the knee. Poor ground condition significantly associated with the injury (x2= 6.7503, p= 0.034). There was a significant association (OR= 2.745, x2= 11.1048, p= 0.0010) between performing particular exercise (41%) and non-performing (59%); and knee injuries. Most injuries were characteristically mild (58.6%). Majority of injuries occurred in contact (74.1%), during games (44%). The significant relationship found between warm up and knee injury (OR= 2.110, x2= 5.8808, p= 0.0107). Physiotherapy treatment 39.6% was the second choice of management. Our findings revealed that midfielders suffered a greater percentage of knee injuries compared to other positions, with injuries being more predominant during match play.","This paper investigates the epidemiological profile of knee injuries among professional male football players, highlighting the prevalence and types of injuries within different positional players.

Recurrent Hamstring Injuries in Elite Athletes - A Paradigm Shift to Mechanical Dysfunction of the Sacroiliac Joint as One Causation,2019-05-01,,,,"Recurrent hamstring injuries is a significant and troubling issue in the elite athletic community.Reinjury may occur in up to 34% of patients in the kicking and running sports.We hypothesised that a proportion of these patients may have mechanical dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint as a causative mechanism.We recruited 23 elite athletes with recurrent hamstring injuries and lateralising lower back pain into the study after careful screening.Diagnosis was confirmed by scintigraphic SPECT/ CT imaging.Patients who failed directed physiotherapy were offered injection of the sacroiliac joint with platelet rich plasma (PRP).All 23 athletes (Av age 35 years, 19 M, 4F) had MRI evidence of hamstring tears (Av 4.2 tears) and met criteria for a diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction with mean clinical scores of 6.8 (Range: 7-9).Four patients returned to sport after physiotherapy and 19 underwent peri-articular PRP injection under ultrasound guidance.The baseline VAS was 80 (mean) and after treatment 9, indicating a significant response to treatment (p=0.002).All patients with SIJ dysfunction and recurrent hamstring tears responded to treatment.A plausible explanation for the relationship is the alteration in muscle sequencing around the pelvis following SIJ dysfunction.","This paper investigates the relationship between mechanical dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint and recurrent hamstring injuries in elite athletes. The study finds that 23 athletes with diagnosed sacroiliac joint dysfunction responded positively to treatment, suggesting a significant link between this dysfunction and the prevalence of hamstring tears in patients engaged in kicking and running sports."

"Six different football shoes, one playing surface and the weather; Assessing variation in shoe-surface traction over one season of elite football",2019-04-30,,,,"Introduction An optimal range of shoe-surface traction (grip) exists to improve performance and minimise injury risk. Little information exists regarding the magnitude of traction forces at shoe-surface interface across a full season of elite football (soccer) using common football shoes. Objective To assess variation in shoe-surface traction of six different football shoe models throughout a full playing season in Qatar encompassing climatic and grass species variations. Methods Football shoes were loaded onto a portable shoe-surface traction testing machine at five individual testing time points to collect traction data (rotational and translational) on a soccer playing surface across one season. Surface mechanical properties (surface hardness, soil moisture) and climate data (temperature and humidity) were collected at each testing time point. Results Peak rotational traction was significantly different across shoe models (F = 218, df = 5, p <0.0001), shoe outsole groups (F = 316.2, df = 2, p < .0001), and grass species (F = 202.8, df = 4, p < 0.0001). No main effect for shoe model was found for translational traction (F = 2.392, p = 0.07). Conclusions The rotational (but not translational) traction varied substantially across different shoe types, outsole groups, and grass species. Highest rotational traction values were seen with soft ground outsole (screw-in metal studs) shoes tested on warm season grass. This objective data allows more informed footwear choices for football played in warm/hot climates on sand-based elite football playing surfaces. Further research is required to confirm if these findings extend across other football shoe brands.","This paper investigates the variation in shoe-surface traction among six different football shoe models over a full season in Qatar, emphasizing the impact of climatic conditions and grass species. The findings highlight significant differences in rotational traction across shoe types and grass conditions, providing valuable data for informed footwear selection in elite football under specific environmental contexts."
Biomechanical Differences in Knee Valgus Angles in Collegiate Female Athletes Participating in Different Sports,2019-04-30,,,,"Background: Dynamic knee valgum is a major risk factor in ligamentous injuries of the knee. Different sports have higher rates of knee ligament injury than others and females experience knee non-contact ligament injuries at higher rates than their male counterparts. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the lower extremity biomechanics of genu valgum in female collegiate athletes of various sports while performing a drop jump test. This information may provide those designing individualized prevention programs assistance in reducing risk of knee ligamentous injury during jumping tasks. Methods: Current members of Idaho State University’s women’s basketball, soccer, and softball teams were evaluated for this study. Thirty-seven athletes participated. Motion capture reflective markers were placed bilaterally on the lower extremities to allow for analysis of knee biomechanics during a double-leg drop jump test. The angles of knee valgum in the frontal plane were calculated and analyzed between sport groups. Results: Female athletes of different sports displayed statistically significant differences in knee angles for both right, and left knees. Post hoc analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that basketball players utilized a more valgus right knee angle compared to both soccer and softball players and a more varus left knee angle compared with softball players. Conclusions: Our study suggests that collegiate-level female basketball players have an increased risk of right leg non-contact knee ligament injury during jump landing maneuvers when compared to collegiate level softball and soccer players due to increased knee valgus movements during the drop jump test. Collegiate-level female basketball players may benefit from biomechanical exercise interventions designed to decrease right knee valgus moments in jumping and landing to decrease their risk of injury.","This paper investigates the lower extremity biomechanics of knee valgus angles among collegiate female athletes across different sports while performing a drop jump test. The results indicate that basketball players exhibit greater knee valgus angles, potentially increasing their risk of non-contact knee ligament injuries compared to soccer and softball players, suggesting the need for targeted injury prevention strategies."
"Case Study: Muscle Atrophy, Hypertrophy, and Energy Expenditure of a Premier League Soccer Player During Rehabilitation From Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury",2019-04-29,,,,"Maintaining muscle mass and function during rehabilitation from anterior cruciate ligament injury is complicated by the challenge of accurately prescribing daily energy intakes aligned to energy expenditure. Accordingly, we present a 38-week case study characterizing whole body and regional rates of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (as inferred by assessments of fat-free mass from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) in a professional male soccer player from the English Premier League. In addition, in Week 6, we also quantified energy intake (via the remote food photographic method) and energy expenditure using the doubly labeled water method. Mean daily energy intake (CHO: 1.9–3.2, protein: 1.7–3.3, and fat: 1.4–2.7 g/kg) and energy expenditure were 2,765 ± 474 and 3,178 kcal/day, respectively. In accordance with an apparent energy deficit, total body mass decreased by 1.9 kg during Weeks 1–6 where fat-free mass loss in the injured and noninjured limb was 0.9 and 0.6 kg, respectively, yet, trunk fat-free mass increased by 0.7 kg. In Weeks 7–28, the athlete was advised to increase daily CHO intake (4–6 g/kg) to facilitate an increased daily energy intake. Throughout this period, total body mass increased by 3.6 kg (attributable to a 2.9 and 0.7 kg increase in fat free and fat mass, respectively). Our data suggest it may be advantageous to avoid excessive reductions in energy intake during the initial 6–8 weeks post anterior cruciate ligament surgery so as to limit muscle atrophy.","The paper presents a 38-week case study on a professional soccer player recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, focusing on changes in muscle mass and energy expenditure during rehabilitation. Key findings include a notable decrease in total body and fat-free mass during the initial weeks, an increase in daily carbohydrate intake to support recovery, and a recommendation to minimize energy deficits to prevent muscle atrophy."
Are Hip Physical Examination Findings Predictive of Future Lower-Body Injury Rates in Elite Adolescent Female Soccer Athletes at Minimum 5-Year Follow-Up?,2019-04-29,,,,"Context : Although elite adolescent female soccer athletes have unique injury risk factors and management challenges, limited epidemiological data exist for this population. Objective : To describe lower-body injury patterns and to determine whether a screening hip physical examination is predictive of future injuries in elite adolescent female soccer athletes. Design : Prospective cohort study. Setting : One US premier soccer club. Participants : One hundred seventy-seven female soccer athletes aged 10–18 years (mean [SD] 14.6 [1.8] y) completed a demographic questionnaire and screening hip physical examination that included range of motion and provocative tests. Interventions : At least 5 years after baseline screening, athletes completed an electronic follow-up injury survey. Injury was defined as pain that interfered with sporting activity. Main Outcome Measures : In addition to descriptive analyses of athletes’ injury profiles, associations between players’ baseline demographics and subsequent injury profiles were evaluated using chi-square tests, and potential predictors of injury based on players’ baseline hip examinations were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results : Ninety-four of 177 athletes (53%) were contacted for follow-up, and 88/94 (93.6%) completed the survey. With mean follow-up of 91.9 (9.3) months (range 66–108 mo), 42/88 (47.7%) reported sustaining a new lower-body injury. The low back was the most common injury region (16/42, 38.1%). Almost half of all injured athletes (20/42, 47.6%) sustained overuse injuries, and 16/42 (38.1%) had an incomplete recovery. Higher body mass index and reaching menarche were associated with sustaining an injury ( P = .03 and .04, respectively). Athletes’ baseline hip examinations were not predictive of their subsequent rate of lower-body, lumbopelvic, overuse, or incomplete recovery injury (all P &gt; .05). Conclusions : Lower-body injuries were common in elite adolescent female soccer athletes, with over one third of injured athletes reporting permanent negative impact of the injury on their playing ability. Baseline hip physical examinations were not associated with future injury rate.","The paper investigates lower-body injury patterns in elite adolescent female soccer athletes and evaluates the predictive value of screening hip physical examinations for future injuries. Findings indicate that while lower-body injuries are prevalent, baseline hip examination results did not predict future injury rates, highlighting the complexity of injury risk factors in this demographic."
The Effect of Cryotherapy Application to the Knee Joint on Dynamic Postural Stability,2019-04-29,,,,"Context : Decreased postural balance is a primary risk factor for lower-limb injuries. Cryotherapy is commonly utilized by clinicians to provide local analgesia for minor acute knee joint musculoskeletal injuries during breaks in play or at halftime. Its effect on dynamic postural balance remains unclear. Objective : To investigate the acute effects of a 15-minute knee joint cryotherapy application on dynamic postural balance, as assessed primarily via a clinically oriented outcome measure. Design : Experimental study. Setting : University biomechanics laboratory. Patients or Participants : A total of 28 elite-level college male field-sport athletes. Intervention : Participants were tested on the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test both before and after a 15-minute knee joint cryotherapy application. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Normalized reach distances, 3-dimensional knee joint kinematics, sagittal plane hip and ankle joint kinematics, as well as fractal dimension of the center-of-pressure path during the performance of the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test. Results : There was a statistically significant decrease in reach distance scores achieved on anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test from precryotherapy to postcryotherapy ( P &lt; .05). None of the decreases in reach distance scores exceeded the reported smallest detectable difference values. No significant differences were observed in hip, knee, or ankle joint kinematics ( P &gt; .05). No significant change in fractal dimension was observed for any reach direction following cryotherapy application ( P &gt; .05). Conclusions : The results of the present study indicate that dynamic postural balance is unlikely to be adversely affected immediately following cryotherapy application to the knee joint.","This paper investigates the effects of a 15-minute cryotherapy application to the knee joint on dynamic postural stability in elite-level college male field-sport athletes.

Foot Motion Character During Forward and Backward Walking With Shoes and Barefoot,2019-04-25,,,,"Backward walking (BW) has been extensively used in athletic training and orthopedic rehabilitation as it may have value for enhancing balance. This study identified the differences in foot intersegment kinematics (forward walking (FW) vs. time-reversed BW) and plantar pressure parameters of 16 healthy habitually shod individuals walking FW and BW using flexible shoes (SH) and under barefoot conditions (BF). BW was found to have shorter stride length (SL) and higher stride frequency (SF) under BF conditions compared with SH, which indicates a better BW gait stability under BF conditions. Decreased HX/FF dorsiflexion at HO in BW induces less plantar aponeurosis tension which may inhibit the windlass mechanism compared to FW walking. Increased forefoot relative to hindfoot (FF/HF) pronation and sequentially hindfoot relative to tibia (HF/TB) eversion combined with medially distributed plantar pressure and a higher plantar contact area in the medial side in BW–BF maybe beneficial in maintaining balance. These results indicate that BW training may be more reliable under BF conditions compared to the SH conditions based on greater sensory information feedback from the plantar area resulting in better biomechanical behavior.","This paper investigates the differences in foot motion and plantar pressure when walking forward (FW) and backward (BW) in both barefoot (BF) and shoe (SH) conditions. Key findings highlight that BW under BF conditions yields shorter stride lengths but higher stride frequencies, suggesting improved gait stability and balance, which may enhance athletic training and rehabilitation practices."
Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of six musculoskeletal preparticipatory screening tests,2019-04-24,,,,"High injury prevalence rates call for effective sports injury prevention strategies, which include the development and application of practical and reliable pre-participatory screening tools.The aim of this study was to investigate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the one-legged hyperextension test (1LHET), the empty can (EC) and full can (FC) tests, the standing stork test (SST), the bridge-hold test (BHT) and the 747 balance test (747BT).Thirty-five healthy, injury-free male athletes (cricket and soccer players), aged 16-24 years, were evaluated by two physiotherapists. For each of the tests, the participants were evaluated twice (on two consecutive days) by each physiotherapist. Both the intra- and inter-rater reliability were determined. Cohen's kappa (k) was calculated for the 1LHET, the EC and FC tests and the SST. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for the BHT and the 747BT. A confidence level of 95% (p ≤ 0.05) was applied as the criterion for determining the statistical significance of the results.The SST presented with the lowest level of intra-rater agreement (ICC = -0.20 to 0.10). On the other hand, the EC test was the only test where one rater achieved an excellent intersessional agreement (k = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-1.20). Substantial to excellent results for the inter-rater agreement for both sessions were recorded for the 1LHET (k = 0.70-0.90) and the BHT (ICC = 0.70-0.90).Reliability values need to be considered when making clinical decisions based on screening tests. A more refined description of the testing procedures and criteria for interpretation might be necessary before including the six screening tests investigated in this study in formal screening protocols.Confirmed reliability of screening tests would enable sports professionals to make informed decisions when designing preparticipatory musculoskeletal screening tools and when dealing with the management of injury risks in athletes.musculoskeletal screening; injury risk management; intra-rater reliability; inter-rater reliability; soccer; cricket.","This paper investigates the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of six pre-participatory musculoskeletal screening tests among male athletes, specifically targeting injury prevention in sports like cricket and soccer.

"Do bone geometric properties of the proximal femoral diaphysis reflect loading history, muscle properties, or body dimensions?",2019-04-19,,,,"Abstract Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate activity‐induced effects from bone geometric properties of the proximal femur in athletic vs nonathletic healthy females by statistically controlling for variation in body size, lower limb isometric, and dynamic muscle strength, and cross‐sectional area of Musculus gluteus maximus . Methods The material consists of hip and proximal thigh magnetic resonance images of Finnish female athletes (N = 91) engaged in either high jump, triple jump, soccer, squash, powerlifting, endurance running or swimming, and a group of physically active nonathletic women (N = 20). Cross‐sectional bone geometric properties were calculated for the lesser trochanter, sub‐trochanter, and mid‐shaft of the femur regions. Bone geometric properties were analyzed using a general linear model that included body size, muscle size, and muscle strength as covariates. Results Body size and isometric muscle strength were positively associated with bone geometric properties at all three cross‐sectional levels of the femur, while muscle size was positively associated with bone properties only at the femur mid‐shaft. When athletes were compared to nonathletic females, triple jump, soccer, and squash resulted in greater values in all studied cross‐sections; high jump and endurance running resulted in greater values at the femoral mid‐shaft cross‐section; and swimming resulted in lower values at sub‐trochanter and femur mid‐shaft cross‐sections. Conclusions Activity effects from ground impact loading were associated with higher bone geometric values, especially at the femur mid‐shaft, but also at lesser and sub‐trochanter cross‐sections. Bone geometric properties along the femur can be used to assess the mechanical stimuli experienced, where ground impact loading seems to be more important than muscle loading.","This study investigates the relationship between bone geometric properties of the proximal femur and activity-induced effects in athletic versus nonathletic females. It finds that ground impact loading associated with different sports, particularly triple jump, soccer, and squash, significantly affects bone geometric values, suggesting that these properties reflect mechanical stimuli more than muscle loading."

Incidence of Knee Injuries on Artificial Turf Versus Natural Grass in National Collegiate Athletic Association American Football: 2004-2005 Through 2013-2014 Seasons,2019-04-17,,,,"The use of artificial turf in American football continues to grow in popularity, and the effect of these playing surfaces on athletic injuries remains controversial. Knee injuries account for a significant portion of injuries in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football league; however, the effect of artificial surfaces on knee injuries remains ill-defined.There is no difference in the rate or mechanism of knee ligament and meniscal injuries during NCAA football events on natural grass and artificial turf playing surfaces.Descriptive epidemiology study.The NCAA Injury Surveillance System Men's Football Injury and Exposure Data Sets for the 2004-2005 through 2013-2014 seasons were analyzed to determine the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), medial meniscus, and lateral meniscal tear injuries. Injury rates were calculated per 10,000 athlete exposures, and rate ratios (RRs) were used to compare injury rates during practices and competitions on natural grass and artificial turf in NCAA football as a whole and by competition level (Divisions I, Divisions II and III). Mechanisms of injury were calculated for each injury on natural grass and artificial turf surfaces.A total of 3,009,205 athlete exposures and 2460 knee injuries were reported from 2004 to 2014: 1389 MCL, 522 ACL, 269 lateral meniscal, 164 medial meniscal, and 116 PCL. Athletes experienced all knee injuries at a significantly higher rate when participating in competitions as compared with practices. Athletes participating in competitions on artificial turf experienced PCL injuries at 2.94 times the rate as those playing on grass (RR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.61-5.68). When stratified by competition level, Division I athletes participating in competitions on artificial turf experienced PCL injuries at 2.99 times the rate as those playing on grass (RR = 2.99; 95% CI, 1.39-6.99), and athletes in lower NCAA divisions (II and III) experienced ACL injuries at 1.63 times the rate (RR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-2.45) and PCL injuries at 3.13 times the rate (RR = 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14-10.69) on artificial turf as compared with grass. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of MCL, medial meniscal, or lateral meniscal injuries on artificial turf versus grass when stratified by event type or level of NCAA competition. No difference was found in the mechanisms of knee injuries on natural grass and artificial turf.Artificial turf is an important risk factor for specific knee ligament injuries in NCAA football. Injury rates for PCL tears were significantly increased during competitions played on artificial turf as compared with natural grass. Lower NCAA divisions (II and III) also showed higher rates of ACL injuries during competitions on artificial turf versus natural grass.","This paper examines the incidence of knee injuries in NCAA football players on artificial turf compared to natural grass over multiple seasons. It finds that while there is no significant difference in the overall rate and mechanism of knee injuries between the two surfaces, specific injuries, particularly posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears, are significantly more common on artificial turf, especially during competitions."
Visual-Spatial Memory Deficits Are Related to Increased Knee Valgus Angle During a Sport-Specific Sidestep Cut,2019-04-15,,,,"Background: Identifying athletes at an increased risk of injury is a promising approach to improve the effect of injury prevention interventions; however, it requires first identifying the potential athlete-specific risk factors. Cognitive ability was recently shown to correlate with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury rates and lower extremity mechanics, marking an underexplored area. A better understanding of how individuals’ cognitive ability is associated with neuromuscular control during sport-specific tasks may improve injury prevention. Hypothesis: Athletes with lower cognitive performance on a standardized cognitive assessment would demonstrate greater increases in knee valgus angle and moment when performing a sidestep cut with soccer ball dribbling versus without. Visual-spatial memory was expected to demonstrate stronger relationships than reaction time or processing speed. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen male collegiate club soccer players participated (mean ± SD: 20.7 ± 2.0 years, 1.78 ± 0.07 m, 76.5 ± 8.9 kg). Participants performed anticipated 45° run-to-cut trials with and without a dual task of dribbling a soccer ball. Peak early-stance knee valgus angle and moment for the plant limb were calculated. Participants also completed a cognitive assessment to evaluate visual memory, verbal memory, reaction time, and processing speed. These composite scores were entered as candidate predictors for a stepwise regression analysis on the dual-task change scores in lower extremity biomechanical parameters (ie, ball handling – non–ball handling). Results: Visual memory composite score (a measure of visual-spatial memory) was the only cognitive outcome significantly associated with the change in biomechanical parameters. Each unit decrease in the visual memory composite score was associated with an increase of 0.21°± 0.05° in peak knee valgus angle during the ball-handling task as compared with the non–ball handling task ( R 2 = 52%, P = .003). Conclusion: Visual-spatial memory was associated with neuromuscular control during a sidestep cutting task during soccer ball dribbling, with deficits in this cognitive domain being associated with increased peak knee valgus angle. Clinical Relevance: Assessing visual-spatial memory ability may provide useful information to better understand conditions associated with impaired neuromuscular control and to potentially identify athletes at an elevated risk for musculoskeletal injury.","This paper investigates the relationship between cognitive ability, specifically visual-spatial memory, and knee valgus angle during a soccer-specific sidestep cut. The findings suggest that athletes with lower visual memory scores exhibit increased knee valgus angles, highlighting the importance of cognitive assessments in identifying risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries in sports."

"Effect of COL5A1, GDF5, and PPARA Genes on a Movement Screen and Neuromuscular Performance in Adolescent Team Sport Athletes",2019-04-13,,,,"Abstract Stastny, P, Lehnert, M, De Ste Croix, M, Petr, M, Svoboda, Z, Maixnerova, E, Varekova, R, Botek, M, Petrek, M, Lenka, K, and Cięszczyk, P. Effect of COL5A1 , GDF5 , and PPARA genes on a movement screen and neuromuscular performance in adolescent team sport athletes. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2057–2065, 2019—The risk of injury increases with adolescents' chronological age and may be related to limited muscle function neuromuscular, genetic, and biomechanical factors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether COL5A1, PPARA, and GDF5 genes are associated with muscle functions and stretch-shortening cycle performance in adolescent athletes. One hundred forty-six youth players (14.4 ± 0.2 years) from various team sports (basketball n = 54, soccer n = 50, handball n = 32) underwent a manual test for muscle function, maturity estimation, functional bend test (FBT), passive straight leg raise (SLR) test, leg stiffness test, test of reactive strength index (RSI), and gene sampling for COL5A1, PPARA, and GDF5 . The χ 2 test did not show any differences in allele or genotype frequency between participants before and after peak height velocity. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that COL5A1 rs12722 CT heterozygotes had worse score in FBT ( p &lt; 0.001), worse score in SLR ( p = 0.003), and lower maturity offset ( p = 0.029, only in females) than TT homozygotes. Male GDF5 rs143383 GG homozygotes showed better score in SLR than AA and AG genotypes ( p = 0.003), and AA and AG genotypes in both sex had greater RSI than GG homozygotes (p = 0.016). The PPARA rs4253778 CC homozygotes had greater RSI than GG and GC genotypes ( p = 0.004). The CT genotype in COL5A1 rs12722 is possible predictor of functional movement disruption in the posterior hip muscle chain, causing shortening in FBT and SLR, which includes hamstrings function. CT genotype in COL5A1 rs12722 should be involved in programs targeting hamstring and posterior hip muscle chain.","The paper investigates the influence of the COL5A1, GDF5, and PPARA genes on muscle function and neuromuscular performance in adolescent team sport athletes. It identifies specific gene variants that may be associated with functional movement disruptions and suggests the implications for training programs targeting the hamstring and posterior hip muscle chain."
Predicting soccer penalty success: an optimality model,2019-04-12,,,,"The penalty shot in soccer is one of the most exciting one-on-one contests in sport, where a single kick of the ball can decide major tournaments and multimillion-dollar prizes. Successful shooters must use power and accuracy to kick the ball beyond the goalkeeper’s reach and into the goal; conversely, goalkeepers must predict the shooter’s intent and move accurately to intercept the ball. Each player’s performance is constrained by biomechanical trade-offs, and success relies on selecting the best strategy to overcome these constraints in myriad situations. Thus, the soccer penalty provides an ideal study system to investigate how the strategies of two competing agents interact to determine success or failure.The aim of this thesis was to quantify the trade-offs faced by shooters and goalkeepers during a soccer penalty, determine the strategies used to overcome them, and show how these strategies interact to affect the outcome. From these outcomes, I developed an optimality model that predicts the likelihood of success for different shooting strategies, accounting for the biomechanical trade-offs that constrain each player. The model can match individual shooters against individual goalkeepers to identify the shooting strategy with the best chance of success.In Chapter 2, I quantified the trade-off between speed and accuracy when kicking a ball. As expected, shooting precision decreased as shot speed increased. I also found that the likely dispersion of shots around a target was dependent on target height, kick technique, and player left- or right-footedness. Aiming at a target off the ground decreased precision compared with a target on the ground, and kicks made with the side of the foot were more accurate, while those made with the top of the foot generated greater speeds. Right-footed players tended to miss above the target and to the right, or below the target and to the left, with the opposite true for left-footed players.In Chapter 3, I identified a previously unknown trade-off between shot speed and unpredictability. Unpredictability is advantageous for a penalty-kicker because it makes the ball more difficult for the goalkeeper to defend. I found that goalkeepers were better able to predict the direction of fast side-foot shots compared with slow- or medium-paced side-foot shots. Furthermore, the direction of shots became easier to predict as the shooter’s kicking action neared contact with the ball. During a penalty, goalkeepers generally start to move toward a side of the goal before the kicker contacts the ball—thus, moving earlier gives them more time to move to reach and intercept a shot, while moving later increases the likelihood that they move in the correct direction. Ultimately, the likelihood that a goalkeeper moved in the correction direction was determined by an interaction between when they began to move and the speed and technique used to kick the ball.A penalty shooter selects where to aim and how fast to kick the ball, and a goalkeeper decides when to initiate movement relative to the shooter’s kicking action. Yet each player can be deceptive, giving the impression of kicking or moving to one side of the goal while doing the opposite. In Chapter 4, I quantified the strategies used by both players, and identified elements of these strategies that interact to affect the outcome of penalty shots. I found that shooters usually aimed toward the lower extremities of the goal, kicking at sub-maximal speeds with a side-foot technique (mean = 23.5 ms-1, SD = 1.9 ms-1, min = 16 ms-1, max = 30 ms-1)—suggesting that shooters prioritise accuracy over speed. Though shooters occasionally tried to be deceptive, goalkeepers were not susceptible to this strategy. Goalkeepers tended to move to either side of the goal, on average, 0.19 s (SD = 0.15 s) before the shooter kicked the ball, though certain individuals moved consistently earlier or later. Faster penalty shots elicited earlier movement in goalkeepers, and were harder to save, even when they were within reach. In contrast with shooters, goalkeepers rarely used a deceptive strategy.            In Chapter 5, I constructed a model based on trade-offs for shooters and goalkeepers that could be used to predict the likelihood of success for any shooter strategy. I parameterised the model with results from Chapters 2-4, and found that in general, faster shots aimed closer to the ground give the best chance of scoring. Importantly, the model can be used to compete individual shooters and goalkeepers to identify the best shooting strategy for that specific matchup. Therefore, a shooter matched against a goalkeeper who tends to move early should shoot toward the centre of the goal; if matched against a goalkeeper who tends to move late, shooting toward the extremities of the goal is the best strategy, with the optimal target location in the horizontal dimension dependent on shot speed and kick technique.Taken together, the results of this thesis indicate the outcome of a penalty shot in soccer is determined by a complex interaction between the shooter and goalkeeper strategies. For a shooter, whatever strategy they choose is subject to the inherent error involved when kicking a ball. However, with knowledge of the goalkeeper’s behaviour, they can select a strategy that directs the shot to regions of the goal unlikely to be defended.","This paper investigates the dynamics of the soccer penalty shot through an optimality model that highlights the trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and unpredictability for both shooters and goalkeepers. By analyzing various shooting strategies and goalkeeper reactions, the study quantifies how these interactions influence penalty success, ultimately providing a framework for predicting outcomes based on specific matchup characteristics."
Dynamic knee control and movement strategies in athletes and non‐athletes in side hops: Implications for knee injury,2019-04-11,,,,"Athletes exposed to rapid maneuvers need a high level of dynamic knee stability and robustness, while also controlling whole body movement, to decrease the risk of non‐contact knee injury. The effects of high‐level athletic training on such measures of movement control have not, however, been thoroughly evaluated. This study investigated whether elite athletes (who regularly perform knee‐specific neuromuscular training) show greater dynamic knee robustness and/or different movement strategies than non‐athletic controls, in relation to overall knee function. Thirty‐nine women (19 athletes, 20 controls) performed standardized rebound side hops (SRSH) while a motion capture system synchronized with two force plates registered three‐dimensional trunk, hip, and knee joint angles and moments. Dynamic knee robustness was evaluated using finite helical axis (FHA) inclination angles extracted from knee rotation intervals of 10°, analyzed with independent t tests. Angle and moment curves were analyzed with inferential methods for functional data. Athletes had superior knee function (less laxity, greater hop performances, and strength) but presented similar FHA inclination angles to controls. Movement strategies during the landing phase differed; athletes presented larger (a) hip flexion angles (during 9%‐29% of the phase), (b) hip adduction moments (59%‐99%), (c) hip internal rotation moments (83%‐89%), and (d) knee flexion moments (79%‐93%). Thus, elite athletes may have a greater ability than non‐athletes to keep the knee robust while performing SRSH more efficiently through increased engagement of the hip. However, dynamic knee robustness associated with lower FHA inclination angles still show room for improvement, thus possibly decreasing knee injury risk.","This paper investigates the differences in dynamic knee stability and movement strategies between elite athletes and non-athletic controls during side hops, a maneuver relevant to knee injury prevention. The findings indicate that while athletes demonstrate superior knee function and different movement strategies characterized by greater hip engagement, both groups exhibit similar knee robustness, suggesting potential areas for improvement in reducing injury risk."

An inverse method was developed to obtain the constants for constitutive equations of a multilayer biological model (skin, hypodermis, and muscle) through the use of indentation tests in combination with a finite element method. For each combination of the experimental factors, two groups of constants were established from the inverse method. Sixteen combinations of experimental conditions and their corresponding constants for the Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equations were obtained to be used in further numerical models. The factor D and factor interactions ADE, CDE, and ACDE were statistically significant with respect to skin mechanical response. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is not a current equation able to represent the mechanical properties of the skin under all the experimental conditions considered in this study.","This paper investigates the influence of various experimental factors, such as room temperature, indentation velocity, and muscle activation, on the mechanical response of soft tissue during indentation tests. The study developed an inverse method to obtain material constants for a multilayer biological model, revealing significant interactions among certain factors that impact skin mechanics, ultimately concluding that no single equation can accurately represent skin properties across all tested conditions."
Effects of Maturation on Physical Fitness Adaptations to Plyometric Drop Jump Training in Male Youth Soccer Players,2019-04-05,,,,"Abstract Vera-Assaoka, T, Ramirez-Campillo, R, Alvarez, C, Garcia-Pinillos, F, Moran, J, Gentil, P, and Behm, D. Effects of maturation on physical fitness adaptations to plyometric drop jump training in male youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 2760–2768, 2020—The objective of this study was to compare the effects of maturation on physical fitness adaptations to a twice weekly, 7-week plyometric drop jump training program. Seventy-six young male soccer players (aged 10–16 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. Before and after the intervention, a physical fitness test battery was applied (countermovement jump; drop jump from 20 to 40 cm; 5 multiple bounds test; 20-m sprint time; change of direction speed; 2.4-km running time-trial; 5 repetition maximum [RM] squat; and maximal kicking distance). Participants were randomly divided into an active soccer-control group (CG) with Tanner stage maturation of 1–3 (CG-early; n = 16) or Tanner stage 4–5 (CG-late; n = 22), and to plyometric drop jump training groups with Tanner stage 1–3 (plyometric jump training [PJT]-early; n = 16) or 4–5 (PJT-late; n = 22). The analysis of variance and effect size (ES) measures revealed that when compared with their age-matched controls, the PJT-early (ES = 0.39–1.58) and PJT-late (ES = 0.21–0.65) groups showed greater improvements ( p &lt; 0.05) in sprint time, 2.4-km running time-trial, change of direction speed, 5RM squat, jumping, and kicking distance. The PJT-early exceeded the PJT-late group with greater ( p &lt; 0.05) improvements in drop jump from 20 cm (ES = 1.58 vs. 0.51) and 40 cm (ES = 0.71 vs. 0.4) and kicking distance (ES = 0.95 vs. 0.65). Therefore, a 7-week plyometric drop jump training program was effective in improving physical fitness traits in both younger and older male youth soccer players, with greater jumping and kicking adaptations in the less-mature athletes.","This study investigates the impact of maturation on physical fitness adaptations from a 7-week plyometric drop jump training program in male youth soccer players aged 10-16. Key findings show that both early and late maturing groups experienced significant improvements in sprinting, running, change of direction speed, and physical strength, with early maturing players exhibiting superior enhancements in jumping and kicking performance."
Medial collateral ligament injuries of the knee in male professional football players: a prospective three-season study of 130 cases from the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study,2019-04-04,,,,"Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury is the single most common traumatic knee injury in football. The purpose of this study was to study the epidemiology and mechanisms of MCL injury in men's professional football and to evaluate the diagnostic and treatment methods used. Fifty-one teams were followed prospectively between one and three full seasons (2013/2014–2015/2016). Individual player exposure and time-loss injuries were recorded by the teams' medical staffs. Moreover, details on clinical grading, imaging findings and specific treatments were recorded for all injuries with MCL injury of the knee as the main diagnosis. Agreement between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical grading (grades I–III) was described by weighted kappa. One hundred and thirty of 4364 registered injuries (3%) were MCL injuries. Most MCL injuries (98 injuries, 75%) occurred with a contact mechanism, where the two most common playing situations were being tackled (38 injuries, 29%) and tackling (15 injuries, 12%). MRI was used in 88 (68%) of the injuries, while 33 (25%) were diagnosed by clinical examination alone. In the 88 cases in which both MRI and clinical examination were used to evaluate the grading of MCL injury, 80 (92% agreement) were equally evaluated with a weighted kappa of 0.87 (95% CI 0.77–0.96). Using a stabilising knee brace in players who sustained a grade II MCL injury was associated with a longer lay-off period compared with players who did not use a brace (41.5 (SD 13.2) vs. 31.5 (SD 20.3) days, p = 0.010). Three-quarter of the MCL injuries occurred with a contact mechanism. The clinical grading of MCL injuries showed almost perfect agreement with MRI grading, in cases where the MCL injury is the primary diagnosis. Not all grade II MCL injuries were treated with a brace and may thus indicate that routine bracing should not be necessary in milder cases. Prospective cohort study, II.","This study investigates the epidemiology and mechanisms of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries in male professional football players, analyzing 130 cases over three seasons. The findings reveal that most MCL injuries occur due to contact, particularly during tackling, with a high agreement between MRI and clinical grading, and indicate that routine bracing for grade II injuries may not always be necessary."
External ankle supports alter running biomechanics: a field-based study using wearable sensors,2019-04-03,,,,"To evaluate the effects of ankle taping, bracing, and fibular reposition taping (FRT) on running biomechanics as measured with wearable sensors.A randomized crossover study design was employed as 12 young adults (six males, six females) with history of ankle sprain completed four 400 m runs at self-selected pace on an outdoor track. One of four conditions (control, taped, braced, FRT) was applied prior to each run. RunScribe™ sensors were heel-mounted on each shoe and measured kinematic (maximum pronation velocity, pronation excursion), kinetic (braking and impact g) and spatiotemporal (cycle time, contact time, stride length, stride pace) variables.Compared to the control and FRT conditions, both the taped and braced conditions significantly restricted maximum pronation velocity (control: 767.8 ± 228.3° s-1; FRT: 721.2 ± 213.6° s-1; taped: 528.8 ± 193.6° s-1; braced: 562.1 ± 178.3° s-1) and pronation excursion (control: 17.1 ± 6.6°; FRT: 17.2 ± 6.6°; taped:11.9 ± 4.7°; braced: 12.9 ± 5.1°). Braking g were significantly higher in the control condition (12.1 ± 0.9 g) condition compared to the taped (11.6 ± 1.0 g) and braced (11.6 ± 1.2 g) conditions. Cycle time was significantly greater in the braced condition (677.8 ± 43.7 ms) compared to taped (669.3 ± 44.6 ms) and FRT (672.1 ± 44.2 ms) conditions.Ankle taping and bracing were shown to be comparable in decreasing ankle kinematics and kinetics, while FRT caused minimal changes in running biomechanics. Taping and bracing may be beneficial in stabilizing and protecting the ankle while FRT should not be used to restrict ankle motion during running.","This paper investigates the effects of external ankle supports, including taping and bracing, on running biomechanics using wearable sensors in a field-based study. The findings indicate that both taping and bracing significantly reduce maximum pronation velocity and pronation excursion compared to control conditions, while fibular reposition taping has minimal impact on running biomechanics."
Association between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and sacroiliac joint dysfunction in young athletes,2019-04-01,,,,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of scoliosis, a 3-dimensional deviation in the axis of the spine. Etiology of AIS is unclear and the general belief is that AIS is multifactorial disorder possibly caused by different factors. It would be worthwhile to reveal new factors associated with AIS. The present study aimed to investigate association between sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction and AIS in young athletes.This case-control study included 196 children athletes (basketball, football, volleyball, handball, ballet, and others), 82 males and 114 females aged 8 to 17, 98 of them with the diagnosis of AIS. The case group consisted of young athletes examined at a regular checkup by a sport physician and diagnosed with AIS. The control group consisted of athletes matched to the case group according to sex, age, sports, number of training years and number of training hours per week, but without AIS.The scoliosis was diagnosed with Adams' forward bend test and the scoliometer measurement. The SIJ dysfunction was determined using the palpation meter (PALM) measuring the sagittal pelvic position in standing position and in standing position with the hip flexion angle of 90°. The data were analyzed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, contingency coefficients, and logistic regression.The average difference in pelvic position in the sagittal plane (in standing position), with and without hip flexion 90° was found to be statistically different in the case and the control groups (t = 13.88, P = .00). There was a strong positive association between variables representing presence of AIS and SIJ dysfunction (determined by contingency coefficient C = 0.62, coefficient Phi = 0.79 and tetrachoric correlation coefficient 0.95).The logistic regression indicated that the average difference in pelvic position in the sagittal plane (in standing position), with and without hip flexion 90° was significantly associated with the probability of scoliosis in young athletes (P = .00, Wald test).There was a strong positive association between SIJ dysfunction and AIS in young athletes.","This study investigates the association between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction in young athletes, including a sample of 196 children from various sports. The findings indicate a significant positive association between SIJ dysfunction and the presence of AIS, with differences in pelvic position being statistically notable between the affected and non-affected groups."
Analysis of Foot Morphology in Habitually Barefoot Group,2019-04-01,,,,"Accurate method to identify foot morphology would further contribute to understand foot mechanism. The aim of this study is to identify foot morphology feature between habitually barefoot and shod population with 3D technology of scan. Sixty subjects both 30 habitually barefoot and 30 habitually shod participated foot scanning test. A 3-dimension laser device was applied to execute foot scanning. The findings of this study showed that habitually barefoot group displayed the foot features of the large ball perimeters, large minimal distance between hallux and other toes and the smaller hallux angle than habitually shod group. To conclude, the significant differences of foot morphology between habitually barefoot and habitually shod was mainly in forefoot area, this morphological features would provide some sights for the exploration of barefoot locomotion.","The paper investigates the differences in foot morphology between individuals who habitually walk barefoot and those who wear shoes, using 3D scanning technology. Key findings indicate that the habitually barefoot group exhibits larger ball perimeters, a greater distance between the hallux and other toes, and a smaller hallux angle, particularly in the forefoot area, providing insights into barefoot locomotion."
Impact Mechanics of Football Helmet with Various Shell Liner Configurations,2019-04-01,,,,"The structure of the skull reveals that the cranial is made up of a number of bones. These bones, except the temporomandibular joint, are joined by sutures. The adjacent bones are strongly united by a matrix of connective tissues consisting of bundles of strong collagenous fibres connecting periosteum to the bones. The little movement at the sutures contributes to the elasticity and compliance of the cranial. This composition serves as a shock absorber and distributes impact force evenly around the skull. Frequent head impacts by footballers cause concussion which leads to brain and neurological disorders such as; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), dementia, depression, and a loss of attention span. These disorders are primarily caused by shock waves following impact, which moves from the front to the back of the brain. As such, the effort is geared at reducing head injuries from concussion by optimising helmet design through shock absorption increase and stress amplification reduction during impact. In this paper, the suture structure is mimicked in the design of a football helmet. A fibre-reinforced composite liner is introduced in the shell of the helmet. The liner runs from the front to the back of the helmet and bisects the shell into two equal parts. Hyperelastic material model is employed in the modelling of the composite liner while the polycarbonate helmet shell is modelled as a nonlinear elastoplastic material. A finite element model based on realistic geometric features of a football helmet was carried out, and an explicit finite element code LS-DYNA® is employed to simulate dynamic responses at different impact velocities of the helmet. The simulation was repeated for various compositions of the composite liner. Impact loads are applied on one side of the helmet shell while the responses are taken on the other side of the shell body of the helmet. To establish the validity of the model, the liner, and the shell materials are made to be the same. The results revealed that the responses of the helmet during impact are the same when the two components are of the same material compared with when there is no liner on the helmet shell. It was also shown that the dynamic response curve of the helmet emanating from different impacting conditions is judged by the maximum principal stress, Von Mises stress, and acceleration monitored within the impact period. The helmet composition with a sinusoidal liner form on the shell absorbed more impact load than other liner configurations.","This paper investigates the impact mechanics of football helmets by analyzing the effects of various shell liner configurations on shock absorption and stress reduction during head impacts. By mimicking the skull's suture structure in a fibre-reinforced composite liner, the study employs finite element modeling to evaluate how different liner designs can mitigate the risk of concussions and related brain injuries in football players."
4 Pre-season hip/groin strength and ratings of health are associated with prospective injury in professional footballers,2019-04-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Hip and groin injuries are a significant cause of time lost from training and competition in elite football. <h3>Purpose</h3> To explore the association between hip/groin injury in professional footballers and pre-season assessment of 1) hip adductor and abductor strength, and 2) the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). <h3>Study Design</h3> Prospective cohort. <h3>Methods</h3> In total, n=204 elite male footballers from ten professional clubs underwent assessments of hip adductor and abductor strength and completed the HAGOS in pre-season. In-season hip/groin injuries were assessed and reported by team medical staff. Data reduction was conducted using principal component analysis. The subsequent factor component for HAGOS, and three factor components for strength and imbalance measures, were entered with age into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine their association with prospectively occurring hip/groin injury. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-four players suffered at least one hip/groin injury throughout the 2017–18 competitive season. The principal component for between-limb abduction imbalance (peak strength in the preferred [kicking] limb – non-preferred limb) (OR&amp;equals;0.61, 95% CI&amp;equals;0.40 to 0.92), and the principal component for HAGOS (OR&amp;equals;0.80, 95% CI&amp;equals;0.64 to 0.99) were independently associated with a reduced risk'of future hip/groin injury. Receiver operator curve analysis of the whole model revealed an area under the curve of 0.76. <h3>Conclusion</h3> These data demonstrate that a lower likelihood of prospective hip/groin injury during the season was associated with a hip abduction imbalance that favoured the preferred kicking limb and higher HAGOS obtained at pre-season.",The paper investigates the relationship between pre-season hip/groin strength and health ratings and the occurrence of injuries in professional footballers. It finds that a greater imbalance in hip abduction strength and higher pre-season health ratings are associated with a reduced risk of hip/groin injuries during the competitive season.
052 Occupational therapy-led fibromyalgia self-management education group programme: patients’ perspectives,2019-04-01,,,,"Calf injuries are common in professional football; thus, the establishment of reliable and time-efficient methods of measuring the peak force capabilities of the plantar flexors with equipment that is accessible to football practitioners is valuable.In this study, we determined the preliminary reliability and feasibility of a new test, termed the kneeling isometric plantar flexion test (KIPFT), for footballers.Twenty-one male youth footballers (age = 17.8 ± 1.1 years, height = 182 ± 5 cm, weight = 77.6 ± 5.9 kg) from English League One football clubs completed three trials of the KIPFT on a wireless force plate at the end (2022-2023) and start (2023-2024) of the season.The within-session reliability of the peak force (relative to body weight) was good-excellent for both limbs and both occasions.On average, performance of the KIPFT took just over 1 min per limb and ~2 min to set up.The peak force values were larger for the non-dominant limbs only at the start versus the end of the season, but there were no between-limb differences.From these results, it was determined that (1) the KIPFT is feasible, (2) a minimum of 32 footballers would be required to establish its between-session reliability with ≥80% statistical power and (3) large-cohort normative data for the KIPFT may be best collected at the start of the football season.","This paper focuses on establishing the reliability and feasibility of the kneeling isometric plantar flexion test (KIPFT) for measuring peak force capabilities in male youth footballers. The study concludes that the KIPFT is a practical and efficient method for assessing plantar flexor strength, highlighting the need for larger cohorts to further validate its reliability in a football context."
Effects Of Attentional Focus Cues On Soccer Trap Kinematics And Performance,2019-03-31,,,,"The primary purpose of this research was to assess how the kinematic performance of an inside of the foot soccer ball control movement changed with an internal, external, or holistic attentional focus coaching cue. The researchers used pendulum catapult to launch a soccer ball from 8.5 meters at the participant. Ten female active NCAA division 1 soccer players received one of three cues, or no cue, and then had five trials to control the ball onto an artificial turf mat to score 1-3 points depending on where the ball landed. Participants completed a manipulation check survey to ascertain the efficacy of the coaching cues. A motion capture system was used to quantify the movement and processed through Visual3D software for the joint angles during 10 frames before and after ball contact. A repeated-measures ANOVA found no significant difference in any of the kinematic variables nor the performance measures between the different cuing conditions, although there were trends within the performance data indicating a higher performance in the holistic cuing condition (mean(sd): .68 (.40)) compared to no cue condition (mean(sd): .28 (.25)). The means of the survey questions indicated strong compliance with the instructions. Given the novelty and exploratory nature of the study, the researchers concluded that the time interval analyzed was insufficient to reveal how the different coaching cues influenced the movement performance. Further analysis is required to assess different kinematic variables and time intervals within the movement.","This paper investigates the influence of different attentional focus cues—internal, external, and holistic—on the kinematic performance of soccer ball control among female NCAA Division 1 players. The findings suggest that while there were no significant differences in kinematic variables or performance measures across cuing conditions, trends indicated improved performance under holistic cues, highlighting the need for further research into the effects of attentional cues on movement execution."
Effects of season long participation on ACL volume in female intercollegiate soccer athletes,2019-03-28,,,,"The aim of this study was to characterize the volumetric changes of the anterior cruciate ligament over the course of a competitive soccer season in female athletes. Seventeen Division-I collegiate soccer players were recruited. Two data collection sessions were conducted. The first data collection occurred prior to the start of the soccer season. Each subject completed a brief questionnaire, had height and weight measured, underwent a clinical assessment of their anterior cruciate ligaments and an eight sequence magnetic resonance imagery of their knees. Contours of the anterior cruciate ligaments were outlined in sagittal T-2 weighted MR images and volumes were calculated using Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization software. Presence or absence of edema within the ligament was determined in pre and post season scans. All subjects were followed during the season to determine if a lower extremity injury had been sustained. Mean ligament volume significantly increased from preseason to postseason (p=.006). There was a 10% increase in the percentage of knees with edema pre to post season. The physical demand of a competitive soccer season in female collegiate athletes appears to cause an increase in volume of the anterior cruciate ligament. The increase in volume may be related to the accumulation of microscopic tears over the course of the season which induce inflammation and edema. The volumetric changes in the ligament may have significant clinical implications, however further studies must be done to determine the relationship between anterior cruciate ligament volume and risk of injury.","This study investigates the volumetric changes in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of female collegiate soccer players over a competitive season. The findings indicate a significant increase in ACL volume and a higher incidence of edema, suggesting that the physical demands of the sport may lead to ligament changes that could impact injury risk."

Bilateral Simultaneous Tibial Tubercle Avulsion in an Adolescent Football Player with Previous Bilateral Osgood–Schlatter Disease,2019-03-24,,,,"Tibial tubercle avulsion fractures are a very uncommon injury, accounting between 0.4 and 2.7% of all epiphyseal injuries. Bilateral lesions are extremely rare with only 20 cases described in the literature. They occur more frequently in male adolescents and during sport activities that require jumping and sprinting, such as football or basketball. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy who sustained simultaneous bilateral tibial avulsion fractures on the background of a previous conservatively managed bilateral Osgood–Schlatter disease.","The paper reports a rare case of bilateral simultaneous tibial tubercle avulsion fractures in a 13-year-old football player with a history of Osgood–Schlatter disease.

Maturity status effects on torque and muscle architecture of young soccer players,2019-03-21,,,,"This study investigated the effects of maturity status on knee extensor torque and vastus lateralis architecture of young soccer players. Thirty-four males aged 13–18 years were divided into two groups: pubescent (PUB, n = 15) and postpubescent (POSP, n = 19). Torque by angle interaction was established for absolute [F(2.649, 84.771) = 9.066, p < 0.05] and relative to body mass [F(2.704, 86.533) = 4.050, p < 0.05] isometric torque with the POSP group showing greater values. Muscle volume torque-angle relationship was similar between groups. Absolute, relative to body mass, and relative to muscle volume concentric and eccentric torque-velocity relationship showed a non-significant interaction but a significant group effect in favour the POSP group for absolute and concentric torque relative to body mass. Torque-angle and torque-velocity relationship normalized by body mass allometric exponents showed a non-significant interactions and group effects. Muscle thickness (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 3.8 ± 0.6 cm), fascicle length (8.3 ± 1.4 vs. 8.9 ± 1.6 cm) and pennation angle (15.0 ± 2.3 vs. 14.3 ± 3.2 degrees) was similar between PUB and POSP groups, respectively. Maturity status did not show a significant effect on muscle architecture and on isometric and dynamic torques when allometrically normalized.","This study examines how maturity status influences knee extensor torque and muscle architecture in young soccer players aged 13-18. The findings indicate that postpubescent players demonstrate greater isometric torque values compared to their pubescent counterparts, although maturity status did not significantly affect muscle architecture or dynamic torque relationships."
Lack of impact moderating movement adaptation when soccer players perform game specific tasks on a third-generation artificial surface without a cushioning underlay,2019-03-21,,,,"The objective of this study was to investigate how the inclusion of a cushioning underlay in a third-generation artificial turf (3G) affects player biomechanics during soccer-specific tasks. Twelve soccer players (9 males/3 females; 22.6 ± 2.3 y) participated in this study. Mechanical impact testing of each 3G surface; without (3G-NCU) and with cushioning underlay (3G-CU) were conducted. Impact force characteristics, joint kinematics and joint kinetics variables were calculated on each surface condition during a sprint 90° cut (90CUT), a sprint 180° cut (180CUT), a drop jump (DROP) and a sprint with quick deceleration (STOP). For all tasks, greater peak resultant force, peak knee extensor moment and peak ankle dorsi-flexion moment were found in 3G-NCU than 3G-CU (p < 0.05). During 90CUT and STOP, loading rates were higher in 3G-NCU than 3G-CU (p < 0.05). During 180CUT, higher hip, knee and ankle ranges of motion were found in 3G-NCU (p < 0.05). These findings showed that the inclusion of cushioning underlay in 3G reduces impact loading forces and lower limb joint loading in soccer players across game-specific tasks. Overall, players were not attempting to reduce higher lower limb impact loading associated with a lack of surface cushioning underlay.","This study investigates the effects of a cushioning underlay on player biomechanics while performing soccer-specific tasks on third-generation artificial turf. The findings indicate that using a cushioning underlay significantly reduces impact loading forces and lower limb joint loading compared to surfaces without cushioning, suggesting a need for improved artificial turf design to enhance player safety during gameplay."
"Determinants of concussion diagnosis, symptomology, and resolution time in U.S. high school soccer players",2019-03-20,,,,"Determinants of concussion diagnosis, symptomology, and other sequelae have not been examined in high school soccer players. Using a sample of soccer-related head/neck injuries from the NATION Surveillance Program, we evaluated potential determinants (sex, injury history, injury mechanism, setting) of concussion characteristics. A total of 378 head/neck injuries were recorded, and 189 (50.0%) injuries from this sample, resulted in a concussion diagnosis. Odds of concussion diagnosis were 84% higher among female players compared with their male counterparts, and over two-fold higher in game settings compared with practice settings. We also observed several significant symptom dependencies, such as higher odds of difficulty concentrating (OR = 5.84, 95% CI = [2.99, 11.42]) given concurrent light sensitivity. Furthermore, we identified injury mechanism as a determinant of concussion symptom resolution time. Our results suggest that determinants of soccer-related concussions and their sequelae are multifactorial, and extend the existing literature with the potential to inform clinical practice.","This paper investigates the determinants influencing concussion diagnosis, symptomatology, and recovery time among high school soccer players. Key findings indicate that female players have a significantly higher likelihood of concussion diagnosis compared to male players, and game settings are associated with greater concussion rates, along with various symptom dependencies impacting recovery time."
A Coding System to Quantify Powerful Actions in Soccer Match Play: A Pilot Study,2019-03-18,,,,"The powerful activity profile of elite soccer match play has not been documented appropriately to inform specific maximal power assessment and development criteria. The aims of the current study were to develop a reliable soccer-specific powerful action (SSPA) notational analysis coding system that could be used to compare frequency and durations of powerful actions during elite youth soccer match play.Sixteen elite male English Premier League (EPL) Academy players (19 ± 1 yrs) were recorded by an individual camera during 16 competitive EPL U18 and U21 games. Video footage was analyzed using performance analysis software and SSPAs were coded according to the following categories: initial acceleration, leading acceleration, sprint, unilateral jump and bilateral jump.The SSPA coding system demonstrated very good inter- and intra-rater reliability (kappa coefficients ≥ 0.827). Elite youth EPL soccer players undertook significantly more initial (31 ± 9) and leading (37 ± 12) accelerations than sprints (8 ± 3; p = .014, d = 1.7, and p < .001, d = 1.7, respectively) and jumps (6 ± 5; p = .002, d = 1.7 and p < .001, d = 1.7, respectively). Players performed a significantly greater number of initial and leading accelerations with action durations below 1.5 s compared to above 1.5 s (p = .001, d = 1.6, and p = .002, d = 1.4), respectively.Our SSPA coding system provides a reliable observational instrument for quantifying the frequency and duration of powerful actions performed during elite soccer match play. In our sample of elite youth soccer players, horizontal accelerations of short duration (< 1.5 s) from different starting speeds appear the most dominant powerful action in elite youth soccer match play.","The paper presents a novel soccer-specific powerful action (SSPA) notational analysis coding system designed to quantify and analyze powerful actions during elite youth soccer match play. Key findings indicate that elite youth players predominantly engage in short-duration horizontal accelerations, with the SSPA system demonstrating high reliability for categorizing and measuring these actions."
Body sensor networks for monitoring performances in sports: A brief overview and some new thoughts,2019-03-18,,,,"This paper aims to review on body sensor networks (BSNs) for sports from performance monitoring point of view with some new thoughts. The focus of the paper is to show that wearable sensor is more efficient than cameras in measuring sport performance and thereby video data and video based systems can be replaced by wearable sensors. Here, the current state-of-the art in BSNs are mainly introduced relating to sports performance instead of physical activity and health/safety related issues for sports and to the best of our knowledge, this has not been done yet for different types of sports rather than a particular sport. Although the progress in BSN for sports performance is in early stage, the ultimate goal is to develop a complete training/match analysis tool using wearable sensors and various analyses techniques to monitor as well as improve performances in sports.","This paper reviews the use of body sensor networks (BSNs) in monitoring sports performance, highlighting their advantages over video-based systems.

Characterizing head impact exposure in youth female soccer with a custom-instrumented mouthpiece,2019-03-16,,,,"While many research efforts have focused on head impact exposure in professional soccer, there have been few studies characterizing exposure at the youth level. The aim of this study is to evaluate a new instrumentation approach and collect some of the first head impact exposure data for youth female soccer players. Athletes were instrumented with custom-fit mouthpieces that measure head impacts. Detailed video analysis was conducted to identify characteristics describing impact source (e.g., kick, header, throw). A total of 763 verified head impacts were collected over 23 practices and 8 games from 7 athletes. The median peak linear accelerations, rotational velocities, and rotational accelerations of all impacts were 9.4 g, 4.1 rad/s, and 689 rad/s2, respectively. Pairwise comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in kinematics by impact source. Headers following a kicked ball had the highest accelerations and velocity when compared to headers from thrown or another header.","This paper evaluates head impact exposure in youth female soccer players using a custom-instrumented mouthpiece to collect data on head impacts. The study reports on the characteristics of these impacts, finding significant variations in kinematic measures based on the source of impact, particularly noting that headers following a kicked ball resulted in higher accelerations and velocities."

The purpose was to analyze and compare the predictive ability of a range of machine learning techniques to select the best performing injury risk factor model to identify professional soccer players at high risk of HSIs. A total of 96 male professional soccer players underwent a pre-season screening evaluation that included a large number of individual, psychological and neuromuscular measurements. Injury surveillance was prospectively employed to capture all the HSI occurring in the 2013/2014 season. There were 18 HSIs. Injury distribution was 55.6% dominant leg and 44.4% non-dominant leg. The model generated by the SmooteBoostM1 technique with a cost-sensitive ADTree as the base classifier reported the best evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score=0.837, true positive rate=77.8%, true negative rate=83.8%) and hence was considered the best for predicting HSI. The prediction model showed moderate to high accuracy for identifying professional soccer players at risk of HSI during pre-season screenings. Therefore, the model developed might help coaches, physical trainers and medical practitioners in the decision-making process for injury prevention.","The paper presents a predictive model for hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) in professional soccer, focusing on machine learning techniques to identify players at high risk. It evaluates various predictive algorithms, highlighting that the SmooteBoostM1 method with a cost-sensitive ADTree classifier demonstrated the best accuracy, potentially aiding in injury prevention decisions by coaches and medical staff."
Balance and Core Stabilization Training with Eyes Open Versus Eyes Closed in Young Football Players,2019-03-13,,,,"Background. Core stability (or core strengthening) has become a well-known fitness trend that has started transcending into sports medicine. It has become a common practice to incorporate balance tasks into the training program for athletes who want to improve performance and prevent injuries. Hypothesis. We suggest that core stabilization and balance training with closed eyes will be more effective than training with open eyes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of core stabilization training with open eyes versus closed eyes on balance and stability of young football players. Methods. Fourteen healthy young football players aged 10–12 years were assessed for pre and post core stabilization training using two balance tests: Stork Balance Test (SBT) and Modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT), and one test for core stability ‒ McGill Core Stability Test (MCST). The intervention included twelve twenty-minute training sessions each of them involved six core strengthening exercises. One group performed exercises with open eyes, and another with eyes closed. Results. Core stability exercises with eyes closed as well as the same exercise done with eyes open insignificantly improved dynamic balance and core stability, but significantly improved the static balance of the subjects. Conclusion. After applying training with closed eyes as well as eyes open, core stability and balance of young football players increased insignificantly. There were no significant differences in core stability and balance training between training with eyes open and eyes closed.Keywords: core stabilization training, balance, open eyes, closed eyes.","The paper investigates the effects of core stabilization training with open eyes versus closed eyes on the balance and stability of young football players. The study found that both training methods led to improvements in static balance, although there were no significant differences in core stability or dynamic balance between the two approaches."
No Evidence of Association Between Soccer Heading and Cognitive Performance in Professional Soccer Players: Cross-Sectional Results,2019-03-12,,,,"Although the scientific community has focused on the effects of concussions in contact sports, the role of subconcussive impacts, as it can occur during soccer heading, has recently gained attention, considering that it may represent an additional mechanism of cumulative brain injury. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of soccer heading on cognitive functioning in active professional soccer players. Male soccer players (n = 44), from two soccer teams that play in the Brazilian A Series Championship, and non-athletes (n = 47), comparable in age and education, were submitted to cognitive assessment, consisting of computerized and conventional neuropsychological testing (Neupsilin battery). In the computerized cognitive assessment, soccer players performed better than controls on reaction time measures in general motor coordination, executive functioning and memory tests, and on accuracy measures in executive functioning tests. There were no significant differences between groups on the Neupsilin battery. A comparison between two sub-groups of soccer players, based on the self-reported number of headings, did not show significant differences on tests performance. No significant correlations were found between an estimate of exposure to heading during professional soccer career and cognitive performance. Our data demonstrate no evidence of cognitive impairment in soccer players, compared to non-athletes, and no association between heading exposure and performance on neuropsychological tests. Longitudinal investigations, including neuroimaging assessment, will help to clarify whether soccer heading may be associated with brain injury and cognitive dysfunction.","This study investigates the impact of soccer heading on cognitive performance in professional soccer players compared to non-athletes. The findings indicate no significant cognitive impairment related to soccer heading and no association between heading exposure and neuropsychological test performance, suggesting that further longitudinal research with neuroimaging is needed to explore potential long-term effects."
Relative Motion Between the Helmet and the Head in Football Impact Test,2019-03-05,,,,"Approximately 1.6-3.8 million sports-related traumatic brain injuries occur each year in the U.S. Researchers track the head motion using a variety of techniques to study the head injury biomechanics. To understand how helmets provide head protection, quantification of the relative motion between the head and the helmet is necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare helmet and head kinematics and quantify the relative motion of helmet with respect to head during experimental representations of on-field American football impact scenarios. Seven helmet-to-helmet impact configurations were simulated by propelling helmeted crash test dummies into each other. Head and helmet kinematics were measured with instrumentation and an optical motion capture system. The analysis of results, from 10 ms prior to the helmet contact to 20 ms after the loss of helmet contact, showed that the helmets translated 12-41 mm and rotated up to 37 deg with respect to the head. The peak resultant linear acceleration of the helmet was about 2-5 times higher than the head. The peak resultant angular velocity of the helmet ranged from 37% less to 71% more than the head, depending on the impact conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the kinematics of the head and the helmet are noticeably different and that the helmet rotates significantly with respect to the head during impacts. Therefore, capturing the helmet kinematics using a video motion tracking methodology is not sufficient to study the biomechanics of the head. Head motion must be measured independently of the helmet.","This study investigates the relative motion between helmets and heads during simulated football impacts to enhance understanding of head injury biomechanics. Key findings indicate that helmets experience significant translation and rotation relative to the head, suggesting that independent measurement of head motion is essential for accurately studying head injuries in football."
Kinematic effects of repeated turns while running,2019-03-05,,,,"Abstract In team sports, non‐contact ACL and MCL injuries occur during abrupt changes of direction, like turns or cutting manoeuvres. Fatigue affects dynamic neuromuscular control and increases knee injury risk. This study analysed how lower limb joints and centre‐of‐mass kinematics are affected throughout a high‐intensity running protocol involving repeated 180°‐turns. Twenty young men (18–23 years, BMI: 20.8–24.4 kg m −2 ) completed a 5‐m shuttle running trial lasting 5 min at an average speed of 75% of their maximum aerobic speed. During the test, cardio‐metabolic parameters were obtained, together with joints and centre‐of‐mass kinematics, using a motion capture system. Kinematic data were compared between the first and the last minute of exercise. Perceived exercise intensity ranged from “hard” to “maximum exertion” and post‐exercise lactate concentration ranged from 5.4 to 15.5 mM. The repetition of 180°‐turns induced a substantial reduction of hip (−60%, p &lt; .001, large effect) and knee flexion (−40%, p = .003, medium‐to‐large effect), and an increase of hip adduction and internal rotation (+25–30%, p &lt; .05, medium‐to‐large effect). Since such movements are factors increasing the likelihood of non‐contact knee injuries, we concluded that the prolonged repetition of turns may expose participants to increased risk of ligament failure. Prevention programmes should include discipline‐specific neuromuscular training especially in late practices.","This paper investigates the kinematic effects of repeated 180° turns during high-intensity running and their implications for knee injury risk in team sports. The study finds significant reductions in hip and knee flexion and increases in hip adduction and internal rotation, suggesting that such repetitive movements heighten the risk of non-contact ACL and MCL injuries, warranting targeted neuromuscular training in preventive programs."
The Evaluation of Musculoskeletal Disorders Seen in Footballers with Regard to Dominant Foot Preference,2019-03-03,,,,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the musculoskeletal disorders observed in footballers with regard to dominant foot preference. The research sample consists of 40 volunteer male footballers with an age range of 14&amp;ndash;18, who are students at Aydın İncirliova Sport High School in the school year of 2018&amp;ndash;2019. &amp;ldquo;Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire Revised&amp;rdquo; developed by Elias et al. (1998) has been used in the study to determine the footballers&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; dominant foot preferences. The questionnaire was translated into Turkish by &amp;Ouml;zsu (2006). Musculoskeletal disorders observed in footballers have been determined by the Turkish version of the Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire. The questionnaire was translated into Turkish and made practicable for Turkish users by being tested by Erdinc and et al (2011). The data were evaluated with SPSS 22.0 package program in 95% confidence range and 0.05 significance level. With the statistical analysis done in the study, it has been determined that there has been no statistically significant difference between the footballers in terms of upper extremity injuries (p&amp;gt;0.05). When the injuries seen in lower extremities have been examined, it has been determined that there has been statistically significant difference in terms of injuries seen in left upper leg, left knee and left lower leg (p&amp;lt;0.05). Within the lights of the findings obtained in the study, it has been concluded that the dominant foot preferences of the footballers have not affected the injuries seen in upper extremity but they have affected the injuries seen in some regions of the lower extremity (left upper leg, left knee and left lower leg). In addition to the known preventive precautions to avoid injuries in young footballers, it can also be recommended to strengthen sufficiently not only the dominant foot but also the non-dominant one.","This paper evaluates the relationship between dominant foot preference and musculoskeletal disorders in male footballers aged 14-18. The study found that while upper extremity injuries were not significantly influenced by foot preference, certain lower extremity injuries (specifically in the left upper leg, knee, and lower leg) were affected, suggesting the need for targeted strengthening of both dominant and non-dominant legs to prevent injuries."
"Incidence, Mechanisms, and Severity of Game-Related High School Football Injuries Across Artificial Turf Systems of Various Infill Weights",2019-03-01,,,,"Artificial turf surfaces are developed to duplicate playing characteristics of natural grass. With the newer generations of sand and rubber infill systems, the infill is a common component that varies between fields and is a critical factor that could influence the player-surface interaction. Because the influence of infill weight on sport trauma is unknown, this study quantified football trauma in high schools in the United States across artificial turf systems of various infill weights.Athletes would not experience differences in game-related injuries across artificial turf systems of various infill weights.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Artificial turf systems were divided into 4 sand/rubber infill weight groups by pounds per square foot: ≥9.0, 6.0-8.9, 3.0-5.9, and 0.0-2.9. A total of 57 high schools in 4 states participated over the course of 5 seasons. Outcomes of interest included injury severity, as a function of infill weight, across head, knee, and shoulder traumas; injury category; primary type of injury; tissue type; specific body location of injury; cleat design; environmental factors; and turf age. Data were subject to multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and Wilks λ criteria through use of general linear model procedures.Of 1837 games documented, 528 games were played on infill weights of ≥9.0 lb/ft2, 521 on 6.0-8.9 lb/ft2, 525 on 3.0-5.9 lb/ft2, and 263 on 0.0-2.9 lb/ft2, with 4655 total injuries reported. MANOVAs indicated significant infill weight effects across injury severity (F2,4648 = 5.087; P = .0001), with significant main effects also observed by injury category, tissue injured, lower extremity joint and muscle, cleat design, environmental factors, and turf age. Post hoc analyses indicated significantly lower (P < .05 to .0001) total and substantial traumas, concussions, shoe-surface interaction during contact trauma, surface impacts, muscle-tendon overload, cleat design influence, adverse weather trauma, lower extremity injuries, and turf age effect while athletes were competing on the 6.0 to ≥9.0 lb/ft2 infill weight systems compared with the lighter infill weight systems.As infill surface weight decreased, football trauma significantly increased across numerous playing conditions. Based on findings, high school football fields should minimally contain 6.0 pounds of infill per square foot.","This study investigates the relationship between the weight of infill in artificial turf systems and the incidence and severity of game-related injuries in high school football players. The findings suggest that heavier infill weights (≥6.0 lb/ft²) are associated with significantly lower injury rates and severity compared to lighter infill systems, indicating critical implications for turf surface recommendations in sports."
The Effect of a Previous Strain Injury on Regional Neuromuscular Activation Within the Rectus Femoris,2019-03-01,,,,"Abstract The rectus femoris (RF) has a region-specific functional role; that is, the proximal region of the RF contributes more than the middle and distal regions during hip flexion. This study aimed to investigate whether RF strain injury affected the region-specific functional role of the muscle. We studied seven soccer players with a history of unilateral RF strain injury. Injury data were obtained from a questionnaire survey and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multichannel surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals were recorded from the proximal to distal regions of the RF with 24 electrodes during isometric knee extension and hip flexion. The SEMG signals of each channel during hip flexion were normalised by those during knee extension for the injured and non-injured RF (HF/KE), and compared among the proximal, middle, and distal regions. Six RF strain injuries showed a low signal area in MRI. There was no significant difference in muscle strength between the injured and non-injured RF. While the HF/KE in the proximal region was significantly higher than those in the middle and distal regions in the non-injured RF, a difference in the HF/KE was seen only between the proximal and distal regions of the injured RF. Furthermore, the HF/KE of the most proximal channel in the injured RF was significantly lower than that in the non-injured RF. However, there was no significant difference between injured and non-injured areas in the HF/KE. Our findings suggest that the region-specific functional role of the RF muscle is partly affected by RF strain injury.","This paper investigates the impact of previous rectus femoris (RF) strain injuries on the muscle's region-specific functional roles during hip flexion in soccer players. The study found that while the proximal region of the muscle showed a significant decline in activation after injury, muscle strength remained unchanged between injured and non-injured regions."
ACL biomechanical risk factors on single-leg drop-jump: a cohort study comparing football players with and without history of lower limb injury,2019-03-01,,,,"Background.The maximum knee valgus angle (KVA) and minimum knee flexion angle (KFA) have been identified as risk factors for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.The present study investigated whether a recent history of lower limb injury in professional male football players can affect KVA and KFA during a single-leg vertical drop-jump (SLVDJ).Methods.Twenty-one professional male football players performed a SLVDJ.The participants were divided into two groups depending on the history of a lower limb injury within the previous 12 months.Two-dimensional video analysis was used to investigate maximum KVA and minimum KFA using Kinovea software.Results.There were statistically significant differences between the injured and uninjured football players during the jump with the least ground contact time in KVA (t = 2.123, df = 19, p = 0.047) and KFA (t = 2.530, df = 19, p = 0.020), and in the mean KVA (t = 2.359, df = 19, p = 0.029) and KFA (t = 2.157, df = 19, p = 0.044).Conclusion.Football players who sustained a lower limb injury within the previous 12 months landed with increased KVA and decreased KFA at initial contact as compared to players without history of lower limb injury within the last 12 months.",This study examines the impact of a recent history of lower limb injuries on the knee valgus angle (KVA) and knee flexion angle (KFA) of professional male football players during a single-leg vertical drop-jump. The findings indicate that players with prior injuries demonstrated a higher KVA and lower KFA at landing compared to their uninjured counterparts.
SESAMOID INJURIES IN PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT ATHLETES PRESENTING TO SPORTS MEDICINE CLINIC,2019-03-01,,,,"Background Sesamoid injuries of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint in athletes occur with sports that place repetitive stress on the plantar aspect of the great toe. Performing artist athletes are particularly at risk for injury given the load placed on the hallucal sesamoid bone often inherent in the activity. Risk factors may include choice of sport, volume of training, sex, bone density, BMI and biomechanical profile of the lower extremity. Hallucal sesamoid evaluation and treatment remains poorly defined in the literature. The aim of this study is to analyze all sesamoid injuries presenting to a sports medicine clinic. The goal of the study is to increase understanding of the injury profile, diagnostic evaluation, treatment regime, and return to sport of athletes with hallucal sesamoid injuries. The long-term goal is to develop evaluation and treatment algorithms that serve to guide clinical decision-making, and improve time to return to sport. Methods A comprehensive retrospective chart review was conducted of athletes presenting to a tertiary level sports medicine clinic located within a pediatric medical center. Electronic medical records were searched using the search term sesamoid. To be included in the study, the injury had to definitively involve the hallucal sesamoid and be related to sports participation. Exclusion criteria included patients with a chronic disease or condition that might affect bone healing or confuse the diagnosis of sesamoid injury, prior history of surgery to the foot, and insufficient management records. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze outcome variables including specific diagnosis, clinical prognoses, diagnostic imaging tools and treatment types. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed for time from pain onset to first clinic visit, and time to return to participation. Little or no correlation was considered 0.00-0.25, weak correlation was considered 0.25-0.50, moderate correlation was considered 0.50-0.75 and strong correlation was considered 0.75 -1.00. Results 326 athletes with 359 hallucal sesamoid injuries were identified. The mean age of the cohort was 15.8 ± 3.8 years (median: 15.3, 95% CIs: 15.46 – 16.24); 86% (n=309) were female and 14% (n=50) of the injuries were male. The mean BMI of the cohort was 21.28 ± 3.5 mg/kg2. Table 1 presents the sports for the athletes in the cohort. The leading sports included 40% (n=144) dance, 13% (n=48) running, and 13% (n=47) soccer. Activities that top the list for females include dance 44% (n=137) and running 13% (n=39). In comparison, male athletes participated in soccer (20%, n=10), running (18%, n=9), and football (10%, n=5) as well as other diverse sports. The most common injuries across both sexes were sesamoiditis (30%, n=107), followed by sesamoid stress fracture (13%, n=46). Table 2 Where self-reported data on dance/sport practice time was recorded, 31% (n=65) reported practicing 10-15 hours per week. Figure 1 The average reported time between injury or the onset of pain to the first clinic visit was 143 days (median: 42, 95% CIs:116.87-169.15). The mean time between pain onset and first clinic visit was greater for female athletes as compared to male athletes (146 days and 119 days). The average time from first presentation to clinic to returning to participation was 115 days (median: 72, CIs:100.7-129.49). Spearman’s rho demonstrated a strong correlation between time from pain onset to first clinic visit and the time to return to participation in both males (? (rho) = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001) and females (? = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001). Males experienced a shorter duration from the first clinic visit to return to participation (mean: 72 days, median 33), than females (mean: 121 days, median 77). The most common diagnostic imaging modalities used were radiographs (72.14%, n=259) and MRI (56.55%, n=203). In both males and females the most common initial treatments included a combination of: walking boot (51.53%, n= 185), physical therapy (38.72%, n=139), and activity modification (34.82%, n=125). These remained the most popularly prescribed treatments in the second and third treatments as well. Conclusions/significance Female athletes participating in dance and running, and male soccer, running and football athletes lead the list for injury to the hallucal sesamoid. Sesamoiditis and sesamoid stress fracture were the leading diagnoses in this cohort. Athletes who presented to clinical attention sooner also returned to sport/dance sooner when compared to athletes who delayed seeking medical attention. Continued research will serve to support anticipatory guidance and education surrounding hallucal sesamoid clinical presentation and need for timely evaluation and treatment in order to minimize time loss from sport/performing artist activity. [Table: see text][Table: see text][Figure: see text]","The paper investigates sesamoid injuries in pediatric and adolescent athletes, specifically focusing on those related to the first metatarsal phalangeal joint. It analyzes the injury profile, treatment regimes, and return-to-sport timelines, identifying key demographics and sports, with a particular emphasis on the higher incidence of injuries among female athletes in dance and running."
COMPARISON OF HEAD IMPACT BIOMECHANICS BETWEEN TACKLE AND FLAG YOUTH FOOTBALL,2019-03-01,,,,"Background: There is growing fear among healthcare professionals and parents regarding youth tackle football, likely due to highly publicized concerns about potential long-term physical and cognitive health of professional football players. Parents and advocacy groups are pushing for state legislation to ban youth tackle football in favor of flag football to avoid repetitive head impacts that are potentially associated with late-life cognitive deficits. Although the head impact burden experienced during flag football is likely lower than tackle, no research has compared head impact exposure between youth tackle and flag football. Therefore, our purpose was to examine head impact exposure and magnitudes between youth tackle and flag football players. Methods: Twenty-seven tackle (age=11.0±1.5y, height=145.8±11.9 cm, mass=45.0±14.9 kg) and 29 flag football players (age=8.6±1.1y, height=133.9±8.4 cm, mass=33.9±9.5 kg) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants were fitted with head impact sensors (Triax Sim-G) worn throughout the entire 2017 season that recorded impact frequency and magnitude (linear [g] and rotational acceleration [rad/s2]). Athlete exposure was defined as one player participating in one session. Impact rates (IR) were calculated as impacts per one athlete exposure. Game, practice, and combined IR were compared between groups using impact rate ratios (IRR). IRR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) not containing 1.0 were considered statistically significant. Acceleration values were binned into low- and high-magnitude categories (linear split at 40 g, rotational split at 4,600rad/s2). Magnitude category frequencies were compared between groups using Chi-square test of association (p&lt;0.05), and 90th percentile acceleration values are presented. Results: One-thousand nine-hundred and eight tackle (735 game, 1173 practice; 70.66 impacts/player) and 169 flag (101 game, 68 practice; 5.83 impacts/player) football head impacts were recorded. Tackle players experienced a higher impact rate during games versus practices (IRR=1.41; 95%CI:1.29 -1.55) while flag players experienced a lower impact rate (IRR=0.60; 95%CI:0.44-0.81). Practice and game head impacts combined resulted in tackle players (IR=3.06) accruing 4.61 times the impact rate (95%CI:3.94-5.40) of flag players (IR=0.66). Tackle players sustained a significantly greater head impact rate than flag players during games (tackle IR=3.83, flag IR=0.55; IRR=6.90; 95%CI:5.60-8.49) and practices (tackle IR=2.72, flag IR=0.93; IRR=2.91; 95%CI:2.28-3.72). Tackle 90th percentile linear acceleration was 53.32 g (median=32.50 g) and flag was 53.32 g (median=32.65 g). Tackle 90th percentile rotational acceleration was 7,000 rad/s2 (median=3,200rad/s2) while flag was 8,300 rad/s2 (median=4,100rad/s2). Tackle experienced a significantly higher frequency of low-magnitude rotational acceleration impacts (71.6% vs. 57.4%) and lower frequency of high-magnitude impacts than flag (28.4% vs 42.6%;?2=15.15, p&lt;0.001). There were no significant associations for linear acceleration (p=0.75). Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate youth flag football head impact rates are 82%-88% lower compared to tackle. Contrary to general belief, youth flag football players experienced numerous head impacts with a greater tendency for high-magnitude rotational acceleration head impacts. Although fewer head impacts occur during youth flag football, parents and coaches should be aware that head impacts do occur during practices and games. Whether high-magnitude or high-frequency head impacts influence long-term health remains unknown. Our findings provide novel evidence into the head impact exposure occurring during youth tackle and flag football. Longitudinal studies examining head impact biomechanics and advanced neuroimaging in youth tackle and flag football players nationwide is warranted to ensure long term cognitive health.","This paper examines and compares the head impact exposure between youth players in tackle and flag football to address concerns about potential long-term health effects. The study found that youth tackle football players experienced significantly higher head impact rates, approximately 82%-88% greater than their flag football counterparts, highlighting the need for further investigation into head impact mechanics and potential cognitive health implications for young athletes."
BIOMECHANIC DATA-DRIVEN BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TO REDUCE CONCUSSION RISK IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ATHLETES,2019-03-01,,,,"Background: Each year, between 1.1 and 1.9 million sports and recreation-related concussions occur annually in US children aged =18 years. Football has a high concussion incidence relative to other youth sports. This is particularly concerning given recent evidence suggesting sport-related concussions are associated with late-life cognitive and psychological dysfunction in former athletes. Unfortunately, there are currently few proven interventions to prevent concussion in football. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a mentored intervention program designed to teach safe play techniques and thereby reduce head impact frequency and severity in high school football players. Methods: In a clustered quasi-experimental study design, the player education intervention program was provided to two out of three teams in year one, two out of four teams in year two, and all four teams in year three. Head impacts were measured using in-helmet accelerometers worn by all players. Head impact data and game video were used to identify “high risk” players on intervention teams to receive individualized mentoring. Players were identified as candidates for intervention based on three criteria: 1) greater than 20% of head impacts sustained to the top of the head, 2) greater than 7% of impacts exceeded 60 g in peak linear acceleration, and 3) player sustained a concussion. High-risk players attended 3 individual or small-group education sessions over 3 weeks with a mentor who analyzed game film to teach safer playing techniques. Intervention effects were evaluated by comparing post-intervention to pre-intervention head impact data. Coach and player satisfaction were assessed to evaluate the program’s acceptability and impact. Results: 220 athletes (143 intervention; 77 control) participated. Of these, 32 (14%) were classified “high risk” with playing techniques amenable to intervention. Overall, 21 (66%) of mentored athletes demonstrated a reduction in top-of-head impacts (considered a high-risk impact zone) and 17 (53%) of mentored athletes demonstrated a reduction in high magnitude (&gt;60 g) hits. On average, the proportion of top-of-head impacts dropped 2.75% in mentored players, and 2.04% in non-mentored players. The proportion of head impacts classified as high-magnitude (&gt;60 g) dropped 1.07% from pre- to post-intervention in mentored players. There was minimal (&lt;1%) change in high magnitude impacts in non-mentored players. In post-season exit surveys, most mentored players “agreed” (n=18, 69%) that his playing behaviors improved because of the study. Most intervention team coaches thought the study was “effective” (n=31, 97%). Conclusions/Significance: Mentoring effects were modest; however, athletes and coaches viewed the program as effective. Behavioral interventions have potential to reduce head impact frequency and severity in football but may require more intensive mentoring than the 3-session model tested in this study. Tables/Figures: [Table: see text][Table: see text]","This study evaluates a mentored intervention program aimed at reducing head impact frequency and severity among high school football players to decrease concussion risk. Results show that a significant proportion of mentored athletes demonstrated reductions in high-risk head impacts, indicating potential for behavioral interventions despite the modest overall effects observed."
Return to play after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: trans-tibial versus antero-medial technique,2019-03-01,,,,"Background.The purpose of the study is to compare clinical outcomes and return to sport between transtibial and anteromedial portal techniques for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction by using single bundle hamstrings grafts secured with variable suspensory fixation device.Methods.Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction were chosen randomly in the period between January 2016 and July 2016.A total of 20 patients met the criteria required to be included in the case study and ultimately grouped by different surgery approaches: 10 transtibial cohort (TT), 10 anteromedial portal cohort (AM).Outcomes were assessed with KT-1000, KSS, KOOS, Tegner-Lysholm scores and Tegner Activity Level scale.Criteria developed by Illingworth et al. were used in the radiological evaluation of bone tunnel placement as a reference to assure quality standards.Results.There was no significant difference in postoperative KT-1000 measurements between the 2 cohorts.A significant improvement in all scores was observed in both cohort.There was a significant difference between the AM group and the TT group in terms of anatomical placement of the femoral tunnels and grafts (p < 0.001).Conclusion.In terms of clinical and functional outcomes, there was no difference between the two groups in the long-term period, except for the time to return sports, which was 6.8 and 7.9 months in the AM and TT groups, respectively.","This paper evaluates the clinical outcomes and return-to-sport timelines for patients undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction using either trans-tibial or antero-medial techniques with hamstrings grafts. The study finds no significant differences in postoperative outcomes between the two techniques, although the antero-medial group demonstrated superior anatomical placement of grafts and a shorter time to return to sports."
Comparison of head impact exposure in practice drills among multiple youth football teams,2019-02-27,,,,"OBJECTIVE Limiting contact in football practice can reduce the number of head impacts a player receives, but further research is needed to inform the modification of optimal drills that mitigate head impact exposure (HIE) while the player develops the skills needed to safely play the game. This study aimed to compare HIE in practice drills among 6 youth football teams and to evaluate the effect of a team on HIE. METHODS On-field head impact data were collected from athletes (ages 10–13 years) playing on 6 local youth football teams (teams A–F) during all practices using the Head Impact Telemetry System. Video was recorded and analyzed to verify and assign impacts to a specific drill. Drills were identified as follows: dummy/sled tackling, half install, install, install walk through, multiplayer tackle, Oklahoma, one-on-one, open field tackling, other, passing, position skill work, scrimmage, special teams, tackling drill stations, and technique. HIE was quantified in terms of impacts per player per minute (ppm) and peak linear and rotational head acceleration. Generalized linear models were used to assess differences in head impact magnitude and frequency among drills as well as among teams within the most common drills. RESULTS Among 67 athlete-seasons, a total of 14,718 impacts during contact practices were collected and evaluated in this study. Among all 6 teams, the mean linear (p &lt; 0.0001) and rotational (p &lt; 0.0001) acceleration varied significantly among all drills. Open field tackling had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher mean linear acceleration than all other drills. Multiplayer tackle had the highest mean impact rate (0.35 ppm). Significant variations in linear acceleration and impact rate were observed among teams within specific drills. Team A had the highest mean linear acceleration in install, one-on-one, and open field tackling and the highest mean impact rate in Oklahoma and position skill work. Although team A spent the greatest proportion of their practice on minimal- or no-player versus player contact drills (27%) compared to other teams, they had the highest median (20.2 g ) and 95th percentile (56.4 g ) linear acceleration in practice. CONCLUSIONS Full-speed tackling and blocking drills resulted in the highest HIE. Reducing time spent on contact drills relative to minimal or no contact drills may not lower overall HIE. Instead, interventions such as reducing the speed of players engaged in contact, correcting tackling technique, and progressing to contact may reduce HIE more effectively.","This paper investigates head impact exposure (HIE) during practice drills among six youth football teams, revealing significant variations in head acceleration and impact rates across different drills. The findings suggest that while full-speed tackling increases HIE, simply minimizing contact drills may not effectively reduce impact exposure, highlighting a need for improved tackling techniques and controlled progressions to mitigate risk."
Imaging of hip and thigh muscle injury: a pictorial review,2019-02-15,,,,"Muscle injuries of the hip and thigh are a highly relevant issue in competitive sports imaging. The gold standard in diagnostic imaging of muscle injuries is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radiologists need to be familiar with typical MRI findings in order to accurately detect and classify muscle injuries. Proper interpretation of the findings is crucial, especially in elite athletes. In soccer players, muscle injuries of the hip and thigh are the most common reason for missing a game. The present pictorial review deals with the diagnostic assessment, especially MRI, of muscle injuries of the hip and thigh. Typical MR findings in muscle injuries include edema, hematoma, and tendinous avulsion as well as partial or complete muscle tear. To estimate the time to return to play, a grading into three groups—muscle strain, partial tear, complete tear—has traditionally been used. Taking into account the most recent literature, there are other prognostic factors such as the longitudinal length of a tear, the tendon's intramuscular component, or persisting edema.","This paper provides a pictorial review of MRI findings related to muscle injuries of the hip and thigh, emphasizing their importance in diagnosing competitive sports injuries, particularly in soccer. It outlines typical MRI indicators, grading classifications for muscle injuries, and discusses relevant prognostic factors influencing recovery time."
Effects of Two Different Recovery Postures during High-Intensity Interval Training,2019-02-15,,,,"ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two different recovery postures, hands on head (HH) and hands on knees (HK), as a form of immediate recovery from high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Twenty female Division II varsity soccer players (age = 20.3 ± 1.1 yr, body mass index = 22.4 ± 1.80 kg·m −2 ) completed two experimental trials in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Each trial consisted of four intervals on a motorized treadmill consisting of 4 min of running (4 × 4) at 90%–95% HR max with 3 min of passive recovery between each interval. HR recovery was collected during the first 60 s of each recovery, where volume of carbon dioxide (V̇CO 2 ) and tidal volume (V T ) were recorded each minute during the 3-min recovery period. Results showed an improved HR recovery ( P &lt; 0.001), greater V T ( P = 0.008), and increased V̇CO 2 ( P = 0.049), with HK (53 ± 10.9 bpm; 1.44 ± 0.2 L·min −1 , 1.13 ± 0.2 L·min −1 ) compared with HH (31 ± 11.3 bpm; 1.34 ± 0.2 L·min −1 , 1.03 ± 0.2 L·min −1 ). These data indicate that HK posture may be more beneficial than the advocated HH posture as a form of immediate recovery from high-intensity interval training.",This study investigates the impact of two recovery postures (hands on head and hands on knees) on heart rate and respiratory recovery following high-intensity interval training in female Division II soccer players. The findings suggest that the hands on knees posture is more effective in promoting heart rate recovery and enhancing respiratory variables compared to the hands on head posture.
The challenge to care in a Premier League Football Club,2019-02-14,,,,"Elite men's football in the UK has been portrayed as a harsh and 'uncaring' micro-political environment. Paradoxically, care has been identified as an essential aspect of coaching pedagogy. Thus, this study drew upon the experience of a case-study strength and conditioning coach to explore caring in a Premier League Football Club. A naturally occurring reflective diary served as a primary data source. Findings revealed that the coach ""cared for"" an athlete through a ""rules based"" approach, which thus far has not been described within coaching research. The narrative also suggested that care was constrained by the competitive context which requires coaches to ""care about"" results, and individuals around the club, e.g. themselves, staff and supporters. This study should prompt significant consideration by coaches who might examine how care is influenced by contextual factors, whilst simultaneously providing novel insights for coaching researchers who may further consider ""rule based"" approaches to care.","The paper examines the concept of care within the competitive environment of elite men's football, focusing on a strength and conditioning coach's experiences at a Premier League club. It highlights how the coach's ""rules-based"" approach to caring for athletes is intertwined with the pressure to achieve results, revealing complexities in the relationship between care, context, and coaching practices."
"Head Injury in Soccer: From Science to the Field; summary of the head injury summit held in April 2017 in New York City, New York",2019-02-13,,,,"There has been an increased focus and awareness of head injury and sport-related concussion (SRC) across all sports from the medical and scientific communities, sports organisations, legislators, the media and the general population. Soccer, in particular, has been a focus of attention due to the popularity of the game, the frequency of SRC and the hypothesised effects of repetitive heading of the ball. Major League Soccer, US Soccer and the National Women's Soccer League jointly hosted a conference entitled, 'Head Injury in Soccer: From Science to the Field', on 21-22 April 2017 in New York City, New York. The mission of this conference was to identify, discuss and disseminate evidence-based science related to the findings and conclusions of the fifth International Conference on Concussion in Sport held by the Concussion in Sport Group and apply them to the sport of soccer. In addition, we reviewed information regarding the epidemiology and mechanism of head injuries in soccer at all levels of play, data regarding the biomechanics and effects of repetitive head impacts and other soccer-specific considerations. We discussed how to release the information raised during the summit to key stakeholders including athletes, parents, coaches and healthcare providers. We identified future areas for research and collaboration to enhance the health and safety of soccer (football) players.","This paper summarizes a conference focused on the rising concerns surrounding head injuries and sport-related concussions (SRC) in soccer, highlighting the need for evidence-based approaches to address these issues.

Biomechanical Comparison of Cutting Techniques: A Review and Practical Applications,2019-02-12,,,,"ABSTRACT CUTTING ACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT MANEUVERS IN MULTIDIRECTIONAL SPORT AND ARE ALSO KEY ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH NONCONTACT ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURY; HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT 3 PRIMARY CUTTING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN STUDIED WITHIN THE LITERATURE: THE SIDE-STEP, CROSSOVER CUT, AND SPLIT-STEP. THESE CUTTING TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATE KINETIC AND KINEMATIC DIFFERENCES, WHICH HAVE DISTINCT IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH PERFORMANCE AND POTENTIAL INJURY RISK. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DISCUSS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE 3 CUTTING TECHNIQUES AND PROVIDE CUTTING TECHNICAL GUIDELINES, VERBAL COACHING CUES, AND CHANGE-OF-DIRECTION SPEED AND AGILITY PROGRAMMING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND PROMOTE SAFER MECHANICS.","The paper reviews three primary cutting techniques—side-step, crossover cut, and split-step—used in multidirectional sports, highlighting their kinetic and kinematic differences that affect performance and injury risk, particularly concerning non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

"Change-of-direction, speed and jump performance in soccer players: a comparison across different age-categories",2019-02-06,,,,"This study examined the age-specific development of vertical jump height, straight and change-of-direction (COD) speed, and COD deficit in one-hundred and eighty-two elite soccer players from different age-categories (U15, U17, U20, and Senior). All participants were players of two distinct clubs and were undertaking different training routines, as planned by their technical staff members. For this purpose, the soccer players performed: (1) squat and countermovement jumps; (2) a maximal 20-m linear sprint speed test, and (3) the Zigzag COD test. The magnitude-based inference approach and standardized differences were used to compare the age-groups. Sprint speed at longer distances (20-m) increased progressively across the age-ranges. In contrast, speed and acceleration performances at shorter distances (5-m) were better in U15 than in the other age-categories. The COD speed did not change throughout the younger categories but presented a meaningful decrease in the Senior category. Surprisingly, despite the progressive increase in volume and intensity of neuromuscular training from younger to older categories, the COD deficit presented a gradual increase across the age-groups. It is possible that simple modulation of the strength-power training program during the maturation process is not sufficient to produce faster adult players with enhanced ability to change direction. Therefore, coaches are strongly encouraged to implement specific COD training practices to tolerate braking at increasing running speeds and appropriate volume and intensity of soccer specific training throughout the players' specialization process.","This study investigates the development of vertical jump height, sprint speed, and change-of-direction (COD) performance across different age categories in elite soccer players. Findings indicate a progressive increase in longer sprint speeds with age, but heightened COD deficits in older players, suggesting that adaptations in training may be necessary to enhance directional speed effectively."
Differences in Anthropometric Characteristics among Junior Soccer and Handball Players,2019-02-01,,,,"The aim of this study was to obtain the relevant knowledge about signifi cant diff erences in some anthropometric characteristics of junior soccer and handball players.The sample included 40 male subjects divided into two subsamples.The fi rst subsample included 25 subjects, who train in the junior selection in the Football club Vojvodina from Novi Sad, while the other subsample included 15 subjects who train in the junior selection in the Handball club Vrbas, from Vrbas.The variables sample included 20 anthropometric measures that defi ned longitudinal and transversal dimensionality of skeleton, volume and mass of the body, and subcutaneous adipose tissue.The results is analysed in a statistical procedure marked as a signifi cance testing of two arithmetic means of the independent samples, a t-test at the level of signifi cance of p<0.05.Based on the result, it was concluded that signifi cant diff erences occur in wrist diameter, ankle joint diameter, upper arm circumference (min), upper arm circumference (max), lower leg circumference (max), upper arm skinfolf, lower arm skinfold, thigh skinfold, calf skinfold, chest skinfold and abdomen skinfold, while the signifi cant diff erence does not occur in body height, bodyweight, elbow diameter, knee diameter, lower arm circumference (min), lower arm circumference (max), upper leg circumference (min), upper leg circumference (max), and lower leg circumference (min).","This study investigates the differences in anthropometric characteristics between junior soccer and handball players.

Biomechanical and Functional Outcomes After Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction: A Pilot Study,2019-02-01,,,,"Previous studies have acknowledged the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) as the primary stabilizer of the patella, preventing lateral displacement. MPFL reconstruction (MPFL-R) restores stability and functionality to the patellofemoral joint and has emerged as a preferred treatment option for recurrent lateral patellar instability.To objectively measure biomechanical characteristics of athletes cleared for return to sport after MPFL-R compared with healthy controls.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.A prospective case-control study design was employed on 31 total athletes. Sixteen athletes (6 male, 10 female; mean age, 16.1 ± 2.74 years; 385 ± 189 days after surgery and 235 ± 157 days after return to sport) underwent MPFL-R and were medically cleared to return to sport. This group was matched by age, sex, and activity level to 15 healthy athletes with no history of lower extremity injuries. Athletes and controls completed validated questionnaires as well as hopping, jumping, and cutting tests with 3-dimensional motion analysis and underwent strength, flexibility, laxity, and balance assessments.Participants in the MPFL-R group scored significantly lower (worse) on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) (89.2 ± 7.6 vs 98.1 ± 2.0, respectively; P = .0005) and significantly higher (worse) on the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) (32.4 ± 5.0 vs 25.4 ± 6.5, respectively; P = .006) than those in the control group, but there was no difference in the Kujala score (95.6 ± 5.3 vs 98.8 ± 3.0, respectively; P = .06). Participants in the MPFL-R group demonstrated reduced hip and ankle flexion relative to those in the control group (P < .05). Participants in the MPFL-R group also took significantly longer to complete the 6-m timed hop test relative to those in the control group (P < .05). No statistically significant differences were found in anthropometrics, knee extension or flexion strength, hamstring flexibility, hip abduction strength, or joint laxity between the MPFL-R and control groups.The current data indicate that MPFL-R generally restores functional symmetry, while subtle deficits in global power may remain after being released to full activity. Clinicians should ensure that athletes are fully rehabilitated before returning to sport after MPFL-R by emphasizing functional multijoint exercises.","This study investigates the biomechanical and functional outcomes of athletes following medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. The findings reveal that while MPFL-R restores functional symmetry, athletes still exhibit subtle deficits in global power and require thorough rehabilitation before returning to sports."
"The Effect of 8-Week Core Training on Balance, Agility and Explosive Force Performance",2019-02-01,,,,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of core strength training on balance, explosive force and agility.28 athletes volunteered in the study.The athletes were separated into two groups: the experimental group (n=15) with the average of age and weight of 19.5 ± 1.2 years and 64 ± 8.9 kg, respectively and the control group (n=13) with average age and weight of 19.4 ± 1.5 years and 67.4 ± 10.3 kg respectively.During the intervention, both groups continued their normal training sessions for 8 weeks.The experimental group performed thirteen core movements 3 times a week for 8 weeks, while control group did not.The experimental group performed each movement with 20 repetitions of 3 sets and a 1 minute rest between sets.Pre and post-intervention, standing long jump, Illinois and double right/left foot balance tests were used to determine the explosive force, agility and balance performance, respectively.Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used for the analysis of the difference between pre-test and post-test groups and Mann Whitney U test was used for the comparison of the two groups.In order to make statistical analysis of the study, the significance level was accepted as p <0.05.After the 8 week intervention, both groups' participants showed significant improvement in the explosive force and agility performance; whereas no significant difference was found in the double right/left foot balance test results.When the difference between the groups was examined, the post test results showed a significant difference in long jump and agility tests.The post test results of the experimental group were found to be higher than the control group.The 8-week core strength training intervention showed no effect on athletes' balance but a positive effect on long jump and agility were observed.","The paper investigates the impact of an 8-week core training program on balance, agility, and explosive force performance in athletes. The results demonstrated significant improvements in explosive force and agility for the experimental group compared to the control group, although balance performance did not show notable differences between the two groups."
Playing football on artificial turf as a risk factor for fifth metatarsal stress fracture: a retrospective cohort study,2019-02-01,,,,"The fifth metatarsal stress fracture is a common injury among football players. Although several risk factors have been proposed, the association between the playing surface and development of fifth metatarsal stress fractures (MT-5) has not been evaluated. We conducted an epidemiological study using a computer-based survey to investigate the association between the playing surface and development of MT-5.This study included 1854 football players, of which 41 experienced MT-5 within the past 24 months. Baseline demographic data and the percentage of time spent playing on artificial turf and clay fields were compared between the non-MT-5 and MT-5 player groups, and the risks for development of MT-5 associated with the playing surfaces were estimated by univariate and multivariate analyses.There were significant differences in body mass index, years of play, playing categories and playing time on artificial turf between non-MT-5 and MT-5 groups (p<0.05). Generalised estimating equations analyses adjusted for multiple confounders demonstrated that relative to the risk of playing <20% of the time on each surface, the OR (OR: 95% CI) for MT-5 for playing on artificial turf >80% of the time increased (3.44: 1.65 to 7.18), and for playing on a clay field 61%-80% of the time, the OR decreased (0.25: 0.11 to 0.59).A higher percentage of playing time on an artificial turf was a risk factor for developing MT-5 in football players. This finding could be beneficial for creating strategies to prevent MT-5.","The paper investigates the association between playing surface and the development of fifth metatarsal stress fractures (MT-5) in football players, highlighting that a higher percentage of playing time on artificial turf significantly increases the risk of MT-5. The study analyzed data from 1854 players, revealing notable differences in various demographic factors and emphasizing the importance of modifying playing surfaces to prevent this common injury."
A review on aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in sports,2019-02-01,,,,"Aero/hydrodynamics plays a vital role in speed sports (athletes, athletes' outfits, sports balls, sports equipment, etc.). Sports balls (spherical - golf, cricket, tennis, soccer, baseball, softball, etc. and oval shape - rugby, American football, Australian football), sports garments (swimsuits, ski jumping & alpine skiing suits, cycling skin suits, skating suits) are affected by aerodynamic and hydrodynamic behavior of fluids (air and liquids). The aero/hydrodynamics dictates the curved flight path of a soccer, tennis, cricket, baseball or golf ball and the course of a surfboard and sailboat through water. It affects speed, motion (position and placement) and ultimately athlete's performance. Ignoring the effect of aerodynamic and hydrodynamics, it is almost impossible to achieve the desired success in any competitive speed sports. Due to stiff competition, the outcome of most sports aero/hydrodynamics research work undertaken by commercial organizations as well as individual sports teams/organizations are kept in-house, and scant information is available in the public domain. The RMIT University's Sports Aerodynamics Research Group has been active in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics research related to some popular speed sports. This paper highlights some research work on sports aerodynamics and hydrodynamics undertaken at RMIT University","This paper reviews the significance of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in enhancing performance in speed sports, specifically examining their effects on athletes, equipment, and various sport balls. It highlights research conducted by RMIT University's Sports Aerodynamics Research Group and emphasizes the competitive edge gained through understanding fluid behavior in sports."
The missing piece of the concussion discussion: primary prevention of mild traumatic brain injury in student athletes,2019-02-01,,,,"The majority of concussion research has focused on timely diagnosis and treatment, yet little has been reported on primary prevention. The goal of this study is to examine the use of core training as a preventative tool. We performed a non-randomized prospective study involving high school athletes. They participated in a 10-week training session with exercises focused on increasing core strength [mobility, agility, stability, strength and flexibility (MASSf)]. Logs were kept of all concussions diagnosed using ImPACT concussion testing. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square to calculate expected/observed frequency and Chi-squared test statistic, χ 2 . Test significance was accepted at a P 2 =9.84, corresponds to a P value of 0.0017. The MASSf program was repeated in the 2015 season with 2 concussions in 121 participants. Our study showed a statistically significant decrease in concussion rates after participating in MASSf training. This program shows a promise as a primary prevention method to reduce sports related concussions.","This paper investigates the efficacy of core training as a preventative measure against mild traumatic brain injuries in student athletes, aiming to shift the focus from post-injury treatment to primary prevention. The study reveals a statistically significant reduction in concussion rates among high school athletes who participated in a 10-week core strength training program, suggesting its potential as an effective intervention."
Switching between pitch surfaces: practical applications and future perspectives for soccer training,2019-02-01,,,,"Soccer training and completion is conventionally practiced on natural grass (NG) or artificial turf (AT). Recently, AT pitches for training / competition, and of unstable surfaces for injury prevention training has increased. Therefore, soccer players are frequently exposed to variations in pitch surface during either training or competition. These ground changes may impact physical and physiological responses, adaptations as well as the injury. The aim of this review was to summarize the acute physical and physiological responses, chronic adaptations, and injury risk associated with exercising on different pitch surfaces in soccer. Eligible studies were published in English, had pitch surface as an independent variable, and had physical, physiological or epidemiological information as outcome variables. Specific data extracted from the articles included the training response, training adaptations or injury outcomes according to different pitch surfaces. A total of 224 studies were retrieved from a literature search. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria: 9 for acute physical and physiological responses, 2 for training adaptations and 9 for injury assessment. The literature lacks consistent evidence regarding the effects of pitch surface on performance and health outcomes in soccer players. However, it seems that occasionally switching training surfaces seems a valuable strategy for focusing on specific musculoskeletal queries and enhancing players' fitness. For instance, sand training may be occasionally proposed as complementary training strategy, given the recruitment of additional musculature probably not involved on firmer surfaces, but the possible training-induced adaptations of non-conventional soccer surfaces (e.g., sand) might potentially result into a negative transfer on AT or NG. Since the specific physical demands of soccer can differ between surfaces, coaches should resort to the use of non-traditional surfaces with parsimony, emphasizing the specific surface-related motor tasks, normally observed on natural grass or artificial turf. Further studies are required to better understand the physiological effects induced by systematic surface-specific training, or switching between pitch surfaces.","The paper reviews the effects of different pitch surfaces—natural grass and artificial turf—on soccer training and performance, highlighting their acute physical and physiological responses, chronic adaptations, and injury risks. It indicates a lack of consistent evidence regarding these effects but suggests that varied training surfaces, particularly non-traditional ones like sand, could enhance specific muscular fitness while cautioning against potential negative transfers to conventional surfaces."
Six weeks of multistation program on the knee proprioception and performance of futsal players,2019-02-01,,,,"Proprioception and vertical jump are important parameters in the performance and prevention of injuries in futsal. However, very few studies have analyzed the role of multistation exercises to improve these variables. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a six-week multistation exercise program on knee joint position sense (JPS) and countermovement jump (CMJ) of futsal players.Thirty-four male futsal players randomly classified into experimental (N.=17) or control group (N.=17). The experimental group included a multistation exercise protocol to their training routines (2 times/week - 6 weeks); the control group continued their training routines. All the players completed similar training routines outside of the multistation exercises. Before (baseline), just after the intervention (Post6Wk) and four weeks later (Post10Wk), CMJ and knee JPS (absolute, relative and variable angular error: AAE, RAE and VAE, respectively) were evaluated.ANOVA showed that the experimental group significantly decreased VAE at Post10Wk compared to baseline, suggestive of greater proprioceptive precision, while the control group significantly increased AAE, RAE and VAE at Post10Wk compared to baseline. The experimental group exhibited lower and thus, better AAE and VAE than the control group at Post10Wk, although no significant differences were found at Post6Wk. No significant differences was found in the CMJ.A six weeks of multistation program may help improve proprioceptive precision of futsal players, even one month after finishing the 6-wk multistation training program. However, this is not long enough to improve proprioceptive acuity and maximum vertical jump. Therefore, the meaningful of these results in term of performance are unclear.","This paper investigates the effects of a six-week multistation exercise program on knee joint position sense (JPS) and countermovement jump (CMJ) performance in futsal players. The study finds that the intervention improves proprioceptive precision, but does not lead to significant enhancements in vertical jump performance, indicating a need for further exploration into the program's long-term effects on athletic capability."

Effects of acute wearable resistance loading on overground running lower body kinematics,2020-12-28,,,,"Field-based sports require athletes to run sub-maximally over significant distances, often while contending with dynamic perturbations to preferred coordination patterns. The ability to adapt movement to maintain performance under such perturbations appears to be trainable through exposure to task variability, which encourages movement variability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which various wearable resistance loading magnitudes alter coordination and induce movement variability during running. To investigate this, 14 participants (three female and 11 male) performed 10 sub-maximal velocity shuttle runs with either no weight, 1%, 3%, or 5% of body weight attached to the lower limbs. Sagittal plane lower limb joint kinematics from one complete stride cycle in each run were assessed using functional data analysis techniques, both across the participant group and within-individuals. At the group-level, decreases in ankle plantarflexion following toe-off were evident in the 3% and 5% conditions, while increased knee flexion occurred during weight acceptance in the 5% condition compared with unloaded running. At the individual-level, between-run joint angle profiles varied, with six participants exhibiting increased joint angle variability in one or more loading conditions compared with unloaded running. Loading of 5% decreased between-run ankle joint variability among two individuals, likely in accordance with the need to manage increased system load or the novelty of the task. In terms of joint coordination, the most considerable alterations to coordination occurred in the 5% loading condition at the hip-knee joint pair, however, only a minority of participants exhibited this tendency. Coaches should prescribe wearable resistance individually to perturb preferred coordination patterns and encourage movement variability without loading to the extent that movement options become limited.","This paper investigates the impact of various wearable resistance loads on lower body kinematics during sub-maximal running. The findings indicate that 3% and 5% loading can significantly alter joint angles and coordination patterns in athletes, suggesting the need for individualized resistance training to enhance movement variability without compromising performance."
The effects of plyometric jump training on physical fitness attributes in basketball players: A meta-analysis,2020-12-24,,,,"There is a growing body of experimental evidence examining the effects of plyometric jump training (PJT) on physical fitness attributes in basketball players; however, this evidence has not yet been comprehensively and systematically aggregated. Therefore, our objective was to meta-analyze the effects of PJT on physical fitness attributes in basketball players, in comparison to a control condition.",This paper conducts a meta-analysis to systematically examine the effects of plyometric jump training (PJT) on the physical fitness attributes of basketball players compared to a control condition.

Assessment of Biomechanical Response to Fatigue through Wearable Sensors in Semi-Professional Football Referees,2020-12-24,,,,"Quantifying muscle fatigue is a key aspect of everyday sport practice. A reliable and objective solution that can fulfil this task would be deeply important for two main reasons: (i) it would grant an objective indicator to adjust the daily training load for each player and (ii) it would provide an innovative tool to reduce the risk of fatigue-related injuries. Available solutions for objectively quantifying the fatigue level of fatigue can be invasive for the athlete; they could alter the performance or they are not compatible with daily practice on the playground. Building on previous findings that identified fatigue-related parameters in the kinematic of the counter-movement jump (CMJ), this study evaluates the physical response to a fatigue protocol (i.e., Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1) in 16 football referees, by monitoring CMJ performance with wearable magneto-inertial measurement units (MIMU). Nineteen kinematic parameters were selected as suitable indicators for fatigue detection. The analysis of their variations allowed us to distinguish two opposites but coherent responses to the fatigue protocol. Indeed, eight out of sixteen athletes showed reduced performance (e.g., an effective fatigue condition), while the other eight athletes experienced an improvement of the execution likely due to the so-called Post-Activation Potentiation. In both cases, the above parameters were significantly influenced by the fatigue protocol (p &lt; 0.05), confirming their validity for fatigue monitoring. Interesting correlations between several kinematic parameters and muscular mass were highlighted in the fatigued group. Finally, a “fatigue approximation index” was proposed and validated as fatigue quantifier.","The paper investigates the use of wearable sensors to quantify muscle fatigue in semi-professional football referees, focusing on the kinematic response during a fatigue protocol. The study identifies key kinematic parameters that serve as indicators for fatigue detection and proposes a ""fatigue approximation index"" to objectively monitor fatigue levels, highlighting diverse responses among athletes."
"The Immediate Effect of High Power Laser on Quadriceps Muscle Performance in Male Football Players: A Single-Group, Pretest-Posttest Trial",2020-12-23,,,,"Introduction: The use of High Power Laser (HPL) has recently been emphasized in physiotherapy. Previous studies suggest that the prophylactic use of laser has ergogenic effects on athletic performance by increasing the contractile function of skeletal muscles. Recently, muscle function improvement is a new research idea in the field of laser therapy. Based on our knowledge, there are only two studies on the effects of HPL on muscle performance although with contradictory results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of HPL on quadriceps muscle performance in male football players.Materials and Methods: Sixteen healthy male football players (Mean±SD age=18.53±7.2 years, Mean±SD body mass index=22.8±4.4 kg/m2) participated in a pretest-posttest study. The subjects received one session of HPL (808 nm, 80 j, 2 w) on quadriceps muscles. The Isometric Peak Torque (IPT), Single-Leg Hop Test (SLHT), and Y-balance Test (YBT) were measured at baseline and immediately after HPL. For statistical analysis, we used the paired sample t test.Results: Immediately after HPL, the IPT (P=0.001), SLHT (P=0.02), and YBT scores (P=0.001) significantly increased.Conclusion: The results of our study showed that immediate application of one session of HPL can improve IPT as well as functional tests. Although the sessions of laser application and assessment were limited and the sample size was small, it seems that HPL could improve muscle performance. Therefore, further research is warranted with large sample size and follow-up.","This paper investigates the immediate effects of High Power Laser (HPL) therapy on the quadriceps muscle performance of male football players. The results indicate significant improvements in isometric peak torque and functional performance tests following HPL application, suggesting its potential as an ergogenic aid in sports physiotherapy."

Optimizing Return to Play After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Soccer Players: an Evidence Based Approach,2020-12-18,,,,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear is currently a main issue in all of sports communities. Although the number of ACL injuries in football remains low, it&amp;rsquo;s consequences on both professional and personal lives remain a major concern of rehabilitation. If practitioners often require more time to bring athletes in the best condition, the fact remains that this concept of time before return to sport is nowadays considered as obsolete. Indeed, the better understanding of the mechanisms of lesion and the strains placed on the graft after reconstruction, allow us to establish a personalized program based on clinical criteria and the patient's objectives. The current scientific literature allows us today to optimize the return to play and performance by the use of neuromotor and neurocognitive approaches, muscle strengthening methods and a preventive program necessary to cover the previous level of the players while taking into account physiological and psychological changes due to ACL reconstruction. Indeed, it is important to have a systemic approach centered on the patient, the sports movement, as close as possible to the field in order to find an optimal function of the knee in interaction with its environment.If there is a risk of reinjury of the ACL, it appears important to be able to identify the risk factors so that the player can return to play in optimal conditions.","This paper discusses optimizing the return to play for soccer players after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, highlighting the importance of personalized rehabilitation programs that consider clinical criteria and the athlete's goals. It emphasizes the use of neuromotor, neurocognitive, and muscle strengthening approaches, while identifying risk factors for reinjury to ensure a safe and effective return to sports."

A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Small-Sided Games on the Repeated Sprint Ability in Soccer,2020-12-18,,,,"To determine the effect of small-sided games (SSG) on the repeated sprint ability (RSA) in male soccer players. A meta-analysis was conducted in which studies were selected from the electronic databases Medline, SPORTDiscus, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Results: Six studies were included and 44 effect sizes (ES) were computed from 116 men (age = 18.0 ± 2.8 yr., height = 175.8 ± 3.3 cm, weight = 68.6 ± 5.6 kg, body mass index [BMI] = 22.3 ± 1.1 kgm2, VO2max = 56.9 ± 2.1 mlkg-1min-1). The SSG training improved the overall RSA performance (ES = -.54, 95%CI = -.89, -.20, p &lt; .05), reduced RSA total time (ES = -.41, 95%CI = -.81, -.01, p &lt; .05), and fatigue index (ES = -.83, 95%CI = -1.65, -.02, p &lt; 0.05). Moderator analysis showed that the fatigue index is impaired when several sessions/week are performed (β = .69, 95%CI = .29, 1.10, R2 = 82.9, p = .001) and is enhanced when the duration of the intervention is extended over several weeks (β = -.25, 95%CI = -.47, -.03, R2 = 56.6, p = .05). The methodological use of SSG enhances the capacity of repeated sprints, while technical and tactical elements are worked concomitantly.","This paper conducts a meta-analysis to assess the impact of small-sided games (SSG) on the repeated sprint ability (RSA) in male soccer players.

Running patterns and force‐velocity sprinting profiles in elite training young soccer players: A cross‐sectional study,2020-12-17,,,,"The Volodalen® field method permits to classify runners into aerial or terrestrial, based on vertical oscillation, upper-body motion, pelvis and foot position at ground contact, and foot strike pattern. The present study aimed to compare the sprint running force-velocity profiles between aerial and terrestrial runners. Sixty-Four French National-Level young soccer players (28 females, 36 males) performed three trials of unloaded maximal 40 m sprints. External horizontal power-force-velocity relationships were computed using a validated biomechanical model and based on the velocity-time curve. Accordingly, the participants were classified into patterns in aerial and terrestrial runners. Terrestrial runners showed a higher maximal horizontal force (F0) (6.73 ± 1.03 vs 6.01 ± 0.94 N·kg-1), maximal horizontal power (Pmax) (14.04 ± 3.24 vs 12.51 ± 3.31W·kg-1), maximal acceleration (Acc) (6.83 ± 0.85 vs 6.26 ± 0.89 m·s-2), and maximal rate of horizontal force (RFmax) (57.41 ± 4.64 vs 52.81 ± 5.69%) compared to aerial runners. In contrast, terrestrial runners displayed a more negative rate of decrease of RF (DRF) (-11.65 ± 1.71 vs -10.23 ± 1.66%) and slope of the Force-Velocity relationship (F-V slope) (-0.83 ± 0.11 vs -0.77 ± 0.10 N·s·m-1·kg-1) than aerial runners. The results indicate that terrestrial runners displayed more efficient force production in the forward direction and displayed more ""force-oriented"" F-V profiles. Nevertheless, aerial runners were more effective in maintaining a net horizontal force production with increasing speed. Our results suggest that terrestrial runners could be more adapted to the specific short distance and high acceleration sprints running.","This study investigates the differences in sprint running force-velocity profiles between aerial and terrestrial runners in elite young soccer players. The findings indicate that terrestrial runners exhibit higher maximal horizontal force and power, demonstrating a more efficient forward force production, while aerial runners maintain net horizontal force with increased speed, suggesting adaptations suited for different sprint dynamics."
"Effect of Natural Turf, Artificial Turf, and Sand Surfaces on Sprint Performance. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2020-12-17,,,,"The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of natural turf, artificial turf, and sand on sprint performance in different sports and to determine how the sport surface affects sprint performance. A systematic search was conducted in Pubmed, Web of Sciences, and SPORTDiscus databases. Out of 5644 studies, 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The studies were very heterogeneous, as they examined different structural characteristics or quality parameters. The studies on natural turf and sand showed significant improvements on sprint speed during training. On the other hand, the analysis of fatigue did not reveal significant differences in the deterioration of sprint speed on both natural and artificial turf. Significance was set at p < 0.05. In conclusion, although lower performance in sprint was reported on sand, further studies are needed to explain the differences in sprint on natural and artificial turf.","This paper systematically reviews and analyzes the impact of different sports surfaces—natural turf, artificial turf, and sand—on sprint performance. The findings indicate significant improvements in sprint speed with natural turf and sand during training, while fatigue levels did not show significant differences between natural and artificial turf, suggesting a need for further research to understand these performance variances."

Soccer Scoring Techniques — a Scientific Re-conception of Time and Space via Biomechanical Modeling,2020-12-14,,,,"From a scientific standpoint, both temporal and spatial variables must be examined when developing programs for training various soccer scoring techniques (SSTs), but a review of current literature reveals that existing scientific studies have overlooked this combinatory influence. Consequently, there is no reliable theory on temporal-spatial identification when evaluating scoring opportunities. Quantified by using biomechanical modeling, anthropometry, and SSTs found in FIFA Puskás Award (121 nominated goals between 2009 and 2020), it is found that players’ proprioceptive/effective shooting volume (i.e. players’ attack space) could be sevenfold the currently-practiced shooting volume. The ignorance of some SSTs’ training leads to the underuse of the potential shooting volume. These overlooked SSTs are airborne and/or acrobatic techniques, perceived as high-risk and low-reward. Relying on the talent of an athlete to improvise on the fly can hardly be considered as a viable coaching strategy. Therefore, for developing science-based SST training regimes, groundbreaking studies are needed to: 1) expand the perception of shooting volume, and 2) entrain one-touch-shot techniques (airborne/acrobatic) within this volume, in short, Focusing-on-Time-in-Space. Whence, the new temporal-spatial theory could guide future researches and develop novel training programs. An increase of airborne/acrobatic goals would ultimately further enhance the excitement of the game.","This paper examines the influence of temporal and spatial variables on soccer scoring techniques (SSTs) through biomechanical modeling, highlighting that current training protocols often neglect the potential of certain high-risk acrobatic and airborne shots. By advocating for a redefined understanding of shooting volume and a focus on one-touch-shot techniques, the authors aim to enhance training programs and encourage a more scientific approach to soccer coaching strategies."
Introducing an Activity-Based Balance Index for Soccer Players: A Validity and Reliability Study,2020-12-13,,,,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of introducing a new activity-based balance index using a triaxial accelerometer during activity. Methods: Twenty seven soccer players (age: 14.5 ± 0.4 years old, body mass: 58.3 ± 9.3 kg, height: 172 ± 8 cm) who participated in the national premier league were recruited. The participants were tested for their balance, activity, and skill in four tests: (I) one leg stance; (II) dynamic Y balance; (III) running; and (IV) dribbling slalom. The acceleration of the body was recorded using an accelerometer during those tests. By processing acceleration data, a new activity-based balance index (ABI) was calculated based on the velocity, acceleration, and position index of soccer players. Using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), reliability was calculated. Results: Reliability was high (ICC = 0.87 - 0.89; 95% CI = 0.77 - 0.93) in calculating ABI for the three activities performed in the tests. A significant positive correlation between ABI and both static and dynamic balance scores (r = 0.62, P = 0.002) was observed. Furthermore, negative correlation was found significantly between ABI and dribbling scores (r = -0.61, P = 0.026) and Y Balance test (r = 0.6, P = 0.002). Conclusions: In conclusion, the introduced ABI demonstrates great potential to determine balance and skill scores based on accelerometer-based measures.","This study introduces a new activity-based balance index (ABI) for soccer players, validated and measured using a triaxial accelerometer during various balance and skill tests.

"Lower-Limb Muscle Excitation, Peak Torque, and External Load Responses to a 120-Minute Treadmill-Based Soccer-Specific Simulation",2020-12-11,,,,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate thigh musculature excitation and torque generation in response to soccer-specific exercise incorporating an extra-time (ET) period. Methods: Twelve semiprofessional soccer players performed 120-min treadmill-based soccer-specific exercise. Surface electromyography (EMG) signals for the rectus femoris (EMGRF) and biceps femoris (EMGBF) were measured as the mean response across a pre-determined 10-second sprint bout during each 15-min block of exercise. Peak eccentric torque of the knee flexors (eccKF) and concentric torque of the knee extensors (conKE) were recorded across angular velocities of 60, 180, and 270 deg∙s-1 immediately pre- and post-exercise. Tri-axial PlayerLoad™ (PL-T) was monitored throughout exercise and defined across vertical (PL-V), anterior-posterior (PL-AP), and medial-lateral (PL-ML) planes of motion. Results: A reduction in normalized EMGRF amplitude was evident at 105‒120 min, versus 0‒15 min (-12.5%; p = .037), 15‒30 min (-12.5%; p = .047), and 45‒60 min (-14%; p = .030). Peak torque of the eccKF was significantly reduced from pre- to post-exercise at 60 (-7.7%; p = .018), 180 (-10.5%; p = .042), and 270 deg∙s-1 (-7.5%; p = .034). A main effect for time was identified for PL-T (p < .010), PL-V (p = .033), and PL-AP (p < .010). Conclusions: These findings suggest that muscle excitation of the rectus femoris is reduced during ET, accompanied with a deficit in the torque generation of the knee flexors following 120 min of soccer-specific activity. Practitioners should adequately condition players for the additional ET period by incorporating exercises into training schedules that develop fatigue-resistant eccentric hamstring strength to minimize injury risk.","This study examines the changes in thigh muscle excitation and torque generation in semiprofessional soccer players following a 120-minute soccer-specific treadmill exercise that includes an extra-time period. The results indicate decreased muscle excitation and reduced knee flexor torque after prolonged activity, highlighting the importance of incorporating fatigue-resistant training to minimize injury risk during extended play."
Is Foot Type an Indicator of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Football Players?,2020-12-11,,,,"Background: Prevention of sports injuries requires a comprehensive analysis of intrinsic and extrinsic factors of injuries in athletes. Pre-participation, evaluation, biomechanical assessment and new technology are helpful in providing useful information about the cause and mechanism of sports injury and strategies for injury prevention. However, there have been only few previous investigations which can conclusively correlate certain foot types with specific knee injury. Objective: To determine any relationship between foot type and ACL injury. Method: A case-control study design was adopted for this clinical study to investigate foot- type as a risk factor for ACL injury. 35 professional football players with a surgical history of ACL reconstruction and 35 professional football players without any history of ACL injury participated in our study. Foot types were determined by measuring their medial longitudinal arch angle and rearfoot-leg eversion angle. Questionnaire which included other variables of ACL injury were filled and analysed to eliminate their interference in this study. Odds ratio was used as reliable statistical tool to estimate the relative risk. Result: There was a significant relationship between pronated foot type as a risk factor for ACL injury. Conclusion: This suggests that pronated foot is a risk factor for ACL injury in football players.","The paper investigates the relationship between foot type and the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in professional football players. The study found that individuals with a pronated foot type have a significant correlation with an increased risk of ACL injuries, suggesting the need for tailored injury prevention strategies based on foot morphology."
The effect of bio-banding on physical and psychological indicators of talent identification in academy soccer players,2020-12-10,,,,"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of bio-banding on indicators of talent identification in academy soccer players. Seventy-two 11 to 14-year-old soccer players were bio-banded using percentage of estimated adult stature attainment (week 1), maturity-offset (week 2) or a mixed-maturity method (week 3). Players contested five maturity (mis)matched small-sided games with physical and psychological determinants measured. Data were analysed using a series of Bayesian hierarchical models, fitted with different response distributions and different random and fixed effect structures. Few between-maturity differences existed for physical measures. Pre-peak height velocity (PHV) and post-PHV players differed in PlayerLoadTM (anterior-posterior and medial-lateral) having effect sizes above our criterion value. Estimated adult stature attainment explained more of the variance in eight of the physical variables and showed the greatest individual differences between maturity groups across all psychological variables. Pre-PHV and post-PHV players differed in positive attitude, confidence, competitiveness, total psychological score (effect sizes = 0.43-0.69), and session rating of perceived exertion. The maturity-offset method outperformed the estimated adult stature attainment method in all psychological variables. Maturity-matched bio-banding had limited effect on physical variables across all players while enhancing a number of psychological variables considered key for talent identification in pre-PHV players.","This study investigates the impact of bio-banding on talent identification indicators in academy soccer players aged 11 to 14. The findings suggest that while physical differences were minimal among maturity groups, bio-banding improved psychological factors like attitude and confidence, particularly in pre-peak height velocity players, indicating its potential value in talent identification."
Kinematics observed during ACL injury are associated with large early peak knee abduction moments during a change of direction task in healthy adolescents,2020-12-06,,,,"Abstract Cluster analysis of knee abduction moment waveforms may be useful to examine biomechanical data. The aim of this study was to analyze if the knee abduction moment waveform of early peaks, consistent with anterior cruciate ligament injury mechanisms, was associated with foot‐trunk distance, knee kinematics, and heel strike landing posture, all of which have been observed during anterior cruciate ligament injuries. One hundred and seventy‐seven adolescent athletes performed cutting maneuvers, marker‐based motion capture collected kinetic and marker data and an 8‐segment musculoskeletal model was constructed. Knee abduction moment waveforms were clustered as either a large early peak, or not a large early peak using a two‐step process with Euclidean distances and the Ward‐d2 cluster method. Mediolateral distance between foot and trunk was associated with the large early peak waveform with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.4 (2.7–4.4). Knee flexion angle at initial contact and knee flexion excursion had odds ratios of 1.9 (1.6–2.4) and 1.6 (1.3–2.0). Knee abduction excursions had an odds ratio of 1.8 (1.1–2.4) and 1.8 (1.4–2.4), respectively. Heel strike landings and anteroposterior distance between foot and trunk were not associated with the large early peak waveform with odds ratios of 1.2 (0.9–1.7) and 1.1 (0.8–1.3), respectively. The knee abduction moment waveform is associated with several kinematic variables observed during ACL injury. The results support intervention programs that can modify these kinematics and thus reduce early stance phase knee abduction moments.","This paper investigates the relationship between knee abduction moment waveforms and kinematic factors during change of direction tasks in adolescents, particularly focusing on mechanisms related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Findings indicate that a large early peak in knee abduction moments correlates with specific kinematic variables, suggesting potential intervention strategies to alter these dynamics and reduce injury risk."
Physical preparation and return to performance of an elite female football player following ACL reconstruction: a journey to the FIFA Women’s World Cup,2020-12-01,,,,"ACL injuries are among the most severe knee injuries in elite sport, with a high injury burden and re-injury risk. Despite extensive literature on the injury and the higher incidence of injury and re-injury in female athletes, there is limited evidence on the return to sport (RTS) of elite female football players following ACL reconstruction (ACLR). RTS is best viewed on a continuum aligning the recovery and rehabilitation process with the ultimate aim — a return to performance (RTP erf ). We outline the RTS and RTP erf of an elite female football player following ACLR and her journey to the FIFA Women’s World Cup, including the gym-based physical preparation and the on-pitch/sports-specific reconditioning. We used the ‘control–chaos continuum’ as a framework for RTS, guiding a return above pre-injury training load demands while considering the qualitative nature of movement in competition. We then implemented the ‘RTP erf pathway’ to facilitate a return to team training, competitive match play and a RTP erf . Objective information, clinical reasoning and shared decision-making contributed to this process and helped the player to reach her goal of representing her country at the FIFA Women’s World Cup.","This paper discusses the return to sport (RTS) and performance (RTP erf) of an elite female football player following ACL reconstruction, highlighting her journey to the FIFA Women’s World Cup. It details the physical preparation and on-pitch reconditioning within the framework of the ‘control–chaos continuum’ and the ‘RTP erf pathway’, emphasizing the importance of objective data and clinical reasoning in achieving her goals."
BIOMECHANICAL MEASURES DURING TWO SPORT-SPECIFIC TASKS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SOCCER PLAYERS WHO GO ON TO ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURY AND THOSE WHO DO NOT: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT ANALYSIS,2020-12-01,,,,"Decelerating and cutting are two common movements during which non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur in soccer players. Retrospective video analysis of ACL injuries has demonstrated that players are often in knee valgus at the time of injury.To determine whether prospectively measured components of valgus collapse during a deceleration and 90 ° cut can differentiate between collegiate women's soccer players who go on to non-contact ACL injury.Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data.51 NCAA women's soccer players completed motion analysis of a deceleration and 90 ° before the competitive season. Players were classified as Injured (noncontact ACL injury during the season) or Uninjured at the end of the season. Differences between groups for peak hip adduction, internal rotation, and knee abduction angles, and knee valgus collapse were analyzed with a MANOVA.Four non-contact ACL injuries were reported at the end of the season. There was a significant difference between groups for hip adduction angle during the 90 ° cut (p = 0.02) and deceleration (p = 0.03). Players who went on to ACL injury were in more hip adduction.Hip adduction angle is larger in players who go on to ACL injury than those who do not during two sport-specific tasks. The components of knee injury prevention programs that address proximal control and strength are likely crucial for preventing ACL injuries.2b.","This paper investigates the relationship between biomechanical measures during deceleration and cutting tasks and the risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in collegiate women's soccer players.

The professional contribution of chiropractors to Danish elite football clubs: a qualitative exploration of role and perceived value in an interprofessional service provision context,2020-12-01,,,,"Background: Interprofessional team-based care has been widely adopted in elite level athletic health and performance practice. Chiropractors can claim some penetration as health care service providers in high level sport. However, their position as valued members of interprofessional health care teams, especially those built around traditional medical organisational structures, is unclear. This investigation sought to explore the perceived role and value of chiropractors as service providers in elite Danish football clubs. Methods: A comparative qualitative case study was conducted. Six Danish premiere league (Superliga) clubs were purposively sampled to compare and contrast instances where chiropractors were both present and absent from the health care team. Triangulated responses were solicited from healthcare coordinators, chiropractors and athletes within each club’s organization through semi-structured individual interviews. The audio-recorded responses were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using a framework approach. Results: Data were collected September and November 2019. A coding framework of 14 codes and 4 code families emerged, centering around the role of chiropractors, benefits of utilizing chiropractic care and facilitators and barriers to interprofessional practice. From this framework, three themes were abstracted, these being: “Broadening horizons”, “In-house preferred to take-away” and “Already covered, or even necessary?” Conclusion: In this practice context, chiropractors fill the role of musculoskeletal health care service providers. Their perceived value stems from additional expert disciplinary knowledge, improved diagnostic triage and increased treatment flexibility. However, where not utilized, the role of a spinal health expert is questioned and when acknowledged, is limited to that of a technician/therapist. It is unclear from this investigation whether chiropractors can claim core provider status. Further exploration of this interesting context of interprofessional practice is warranted.","This paper investigates the role and perceived value of chiropractors within elite Danish football clubs, emphasizing their integration in interprofessional healthcare teams. Key findings highlight the benefits of chiropractic care, including improved diagnostic triage and treatment flexibility, while also questioning their status as core providers when their services are not utilized."
"Physiological and physical effect on U-12 and U-15 football players, with the manipulation of task constraints: field size and goalkeeper in small-sided games of 4x4 players. [Efecto fisiológico y físico en los jugadores de fútbol Sub-12 y Sub-15, con la manipulación de las restricciones de tareas: tamaño de campo y portero en juegos reducidos de jugadores 4x4].",2020-12-01,,,,"Our study aimed to verify whether the manipulation of task constraints has different effects according to age group. Another objective was to verify the physiological and physical responses in the different formats of small-sided games (SSG). Each team in the SSGs was composed of 4 players (4x4). The participants in the research are young football players U-12 (n=8) and U-15 (n=8), affiliated with a club certified as a training entity, and competed in the regional football championship of 7 and 9 players and the national championship of Portugal, respectively. The internal and external load data were collected in 5 formats of SSGs with three field size and in 2 used goalkeepers. We used the WIMU PROTM inertial device for data collection. The registration of the internal charge, using heart rate (HR), was performed with the use by the players of Garmin bands, which send the data to WIMU PROTM devices, through of Ant+ technology. The variance analysis (ANOVA) was used to verify the differences between SSGs and the effect size was determined by calculating partial eta-square). Comparisons between the two age groups were evaluated using standardized differences with combined variance (Cohen’s d). The results show that the manipulation of the playing areas and the use of goalkeepers promoted different effects in the two age groups in terms of distance, explosive distance, accelerations/decelerations and maximum sprint. As for the comparison between SSGs we found differences in the level of external load (distance, accelerations/decelerations and maximum sprint). At the level of internal load, the effects were more evident with field areas above 100m2. We can conclude that the manipulation of the task conditions, playing area and goalkeeper, promote different physical and physiological responses, and the coach should consider this fact, as well as the effects promoted in the age groups.","This paper investigates the physiological and physical effects of manipulating task constraints, specifically field size and the presence of a goalkeeper, on U-12 and U-15 football players during small-sided games.

SPRINT PERFORMANCE IN FOOTBALL (SOCCER) PLAYERS WITH AND WITHOUT A PREVIOUS HAMSTRING STRAIN INJURY: AN EXPLORATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY,2020-12-01,,,,"Background: Hamstring strain injuries are common in many sports. Following a hamstring injury, deficits in peak and explosive strength may persist after return to sport potentially affecting sprint performance. Assessment of repeated-sprint ability is recognized as an important part of the return to sport evaluation after a hamstring injury.Purpose: This purpose of this exploratory cross-sectional study was to compare sprinting performance obtained during a repeated-sprint test between football players with and without a previous hamstring strain injury. Methods: Forty-four fully active sub-elite football players, 11 with a previous hamstring strain injury during the preceding 12 months (cases; mean age, SD: 25.6 ± 4.4) and 33 demographically similar controls (mean age, SD: 23.2 ± 3.7), were included from six clubs. All players underwent a repeated-sprint test, consisting of six 30-meter maximal sprints with 90 seconds of recovery between sprints. Sprint performance was captured using high-speed video-recording and subsequently assessed by a blinded tester to calculate maximal sprint velocity, maximal horizontal force, maximal horizontal power, and mechanical effectiveness. Results: A significant between-group difference was seen in favor of players having a previous hamstring injury over 6 sprints for maximal velocity (mean difference: 0.457 m/s, 95% CI: 0.059-0.849, p = 0.025) and mechanical effectiveness (mean difference: 0.009, 95% CI: 0.001-0.016, p = 0.020). Conclusion: Repeated-sprint performance was not impaired in football players with a previous hamstring strain injury; in fact, higher mean maximal sprinting velocity and better mechanical effectiveness were found in players with compared to without a previous hamstring injury. The higher sprinting velocity, which likely increases biomechanical load on the hamstring muscles, in previously injured players may increase the risk of recurrent injuries. Level of evidence: 3b.","This study evaluates sprint performance differences between football players with and without a history of hamstring strain injuries during a repeated-sprint test. The results indicate that players with prior hamstring injuries demonstrated greater maximal sprint velocity and mechanical effectiveness, suggesting that their sprinting capabilities were not impaired, although this may elevate their risk of re-injury."

Effect of Training and Match Loads on Hamstring Passive Stiffness in Professional Soccer Players.,2020-12-01,,,,"Objective the purpose of this study was to identify differences in hamstring passive stiffness between the pre-season and in-season periods. Methods Hamstring strength and passive stiffness were measured in professional male soccer players before and after the pre-season (4 weeks), and after the in-season (6 weeks) periods using an isokinetic dynamometer. Muscle passive stiffness was determined from the slope of the passive torque-angle relationship. External loads (acceleration and jumps) were monitored by GPS and internal loads by questionnaire. Results Hamstring passive stiffness increased after 10 weeks of training and matches, without changes in passive peak torque and range of motion. The hamstring passive stiffness modifications were associated with the volume and intensity of accelerations and jumps. The individual data analysis also provided some support for the suppression of the biomechanical adaptation in the subjects with relatively large external load. Conclusions Regular training and match workouts increase hamstring passive stiffness in professional soccer players but the adaptation of muscle-tendon unit passive elements might not occur if players experience excessive mechanical stress.","This study investigates the effects of training and match loads on hamstring passive stiffness in professional soccer players across pre-season and in-season periods. The findings indicate that while regular training significantly increases hamstring passive stiffness, excessive mechanical stress may hinder this adaptation."
The Relationship between Nordic Hamstring Test and Isokinetic Dynamometry in Football and Track and Field Student Athletes: a Cross-Sectional Study,2020-12-01,,,,"Background.Nordic hamstring test is a field-based test to estimate the hamstrings' injury risk.The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Nordic hamstring test and isokinetic dynamometry in football and track and field student athletes.Methods.Knee flexor eccentric peak torque of hamstring, optimum length, and muscle balance indices were obtained in two seated and lying positions in 22 footballs and 22 track and field student athletes.The Nordic break point angle was also measured.Results.There were significant correlations between isokinetic dynamometry indices and breakpoint angles (P=0.000).Best predictors of break point angle were muscle balance indices and eccentric hamstring peak torques in lying position (P < 0.05).Conclusions.It seems that Nordic hamstring test is related to isokinetic dynamometry.This relationship is also dependent on the hip joint positioning.These findings may have implications in the assessment of athletic performance.","This study investigates the relationship between the Nordic hamstring test and isokinetic dynamometry in football and track and field student athletes to assess hamstring injury risk.

Effects of Motor Control Training on the Concept of Kinetic Control in Treating Patella Ligament Tendinopathy in a Female Football Player: A Case Study,2020-12-01,,,,"Objectives: Patellar ligament tendinopathy, also known as jumper’s knee, is a group of pain symptoms of the anterior side of the knee joint. The Kinetic Control (KC) concept uses the movement control rating system, based on motor tests and exercises aimed at re-educating motor control. The present study explored the effects of motor control training on the KC concept in treating patella ligament tendinopathy in a female football player. Methods: The current case study was conducted on a 20-year-old female football player. She had been complaining of pain in the front of the right knee joint for two months. Her treatment involved KC training was conducted for 6 weeks (3 times a week for 30 minutes). To investigate the effectiveness of the presented therapy, the following tools were used: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment–Patella (VISA-P scale), the Modified Laitinen Pain Questionnaire, Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) test on a dynamometric platform, and quadriceps muscle isometric test. The Asymmetry Index (AI) was applied to assess the asymmetry of quadriceps strength and lower limb loading. Results: The degree of pain (i.e. measured by the VAS) decreased from 7 points at pre-training to 1 point after 6 weeks of therapy. In the VISA-P measurement, pain decreased as a result of an increase in points from 53 to 82. Pain complaints (i.e. measured using the Laitinen questionnaire) decreased from 7 to 2 points. After treatment, the AI improved in all phases of the tests. Discussion: The achieved data indicated that the neuromuscular KC training was effective in treating patellar tendinopathy. However, it is necessary to conduct further studies with larger sample size.","This case study investigates the effectiveness of motor control training based on the Kinetic Control (KC) concept for treating patellar ligament tendinopathy in a female football player. The results show significant reductions in pain and improvements in strength and function after a 6-week training program, suggesting that neuromuscular KC training can be beneficial for this condition, although larger studies are needed for confirmation."
"Validation of mDurance, A Wearable Surface Electromyography System for Muscle Activity Assessment",2020-11-27,,,,"The mDurance® system is an innovative digital tool that combines wearable surface electromyography (sEMG), mobile computing and cloud analysis to streamline and automatize the assessment of muscle activity. The tool is particularly devised to support clinicians and sport professionals in their daily routines, as an assessment tool in the prevention, monitoring rehabilitation and training field. This study aimed at determining the validity of the mDurance system for measuring muscle activity by comparing sEMG output with a reference sEMG system, the Delsys® system. Fifteen participants were tested during isokinetic knee extensions at three different speeds (60, 180, and 300 deg/s), for two muscles (rectus femoris [RF] and vastus lateralis [VL]) and two different electrodes locations (proximal and distal placement). The maximum voluntary isometric contraction was carried out for the normalization of the signal, followed by dynamic isokinetic knee extensions for each speed. The sEMG output for both systems was obtained from the raw sEMG signal following mDurance's processing and filtering. Mean, median, first quartile, third quartile and 90th percentile was calculated from the sEMG amplitude signals for each system. The results show an almost perfect ICC relationship for the VL (ICC &amp;gt; 0.81) and substantial to almost perfect for the RF (ICC &amp;gt; 0.762) for all variables and speeds. The Bland-Altman plots revealed heteroscedasticity of error for mean, quartile 3 and 90th percentile (60 and 300 deg/s) for RF and at mean and 90th percentile for VL (300 deg/s). In conclusion, the results indicate that the mDurance® sEMG system is a valid tool to measure muscle activity during dynamic contractions over a range of speeds. This innovative system provides more time for clinicians (e.g., interpretation patients' pathologies) and sport trainers (e.g., advising athletes), thanks to automatic processing and filtering of the raw sEMG signal and generation of muscle activity reports in real-time.","This paper discusses the validation of the mDurance® system, a wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) tool designed to assess muscle activity, particularly in clinical and sports settings. The study demonstrates the system's validity by comparing its outputs to a reference system, showing reliable performance in measuring muscle activity during dynamic knee extensions across various speeds."
Intra- and interrater reliability of subjective assessment of the drop vertical jump and tuck jump in youth athletes,2020-11-24,,,,"To investigate intra- and interrater reliability of the subjective assessments of filmed DVJ and TJA in youth male and female soccer players and to compare subjective assessment of the DVJ with two-dimensional movement analysis. Cross-sectional study. 115 soccer players (66 boys, 49 girls) mean age 14 ± 1 (range 13–16) years. Knee control during landing phase of DVJ was assessed using a 3-graded scoring scale. TJA was assessed according to ten criteria using a dichotomous grading scale. Subjective assessment of DVJ was compared with calculation of normalized knee separation distance (NKSD). Intrarater reliability for DVJ was substantial to almost perfect (kappa 0.72 rater 1; 0.85 rater 2). Interrater reliability was substantial to almost perfect (kappa from 0.68 to 0.83). The TJA total score intrarater reliability was ICC 0.59 for rater 1 and 0.90 for rater 2. Interrater reliability ranged from ICC 0.51 to 0.60. There were between-group differences in mean NKSD during DVJ for players rated as 0, 1 and 2, but within-group variability was large. Assessment of DVJ and TJA in youth athletes was rater dependent. Players with subjectively assessed reduced or poor knee control had smaller normalized knee separation distance in DVJ.","This paper investigates the intra- and interrater reliability of subjective assessments of the drop vertical jump (DVJ) and tuck jump (TJA) in youth soccer players, using both a scoring scale and two-dimensional movement analysis.

Characterization of the Biomechanical and Situational Aspects of High Magnitude Subconcussive Impacts in Collegiate Football,2020-11-17,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The objective of this study was to characterize high magnitude subconcussive impacts in football to identify injurious relationships between player/game-based characteristics and impact magnitude and frequency. <h3>Background</h3> Subconcussive impacts are asymptomatic head impacts thought to induce alterations in the brain after repetitive exposure. Understanding factors that lead to higher magnitude or frequency of head impacts in football is crucial to develop harm reduction and prevention strategies. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Eighty-one male university level football players were equipped with helmet accelerometers to capture linear acceleration (LA), impact frequency and helmet impact location. Impacts with LA = 60 g were included in the analysis. Video footage from 15 games over three seasons was analyzed to characterize aspects of play including play type, position, closing distance, player technique, tackling versus blocking and impact type (helmet-to-helmet/body/ground). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 570 impacts were included in the analysis with a mean LA of 83.44 g ± 23.60. Impacts with a closing distance of = 10 yards resulted in higher LA compared to &lt;10 yards and occurred most frequently in run plays. Wide receivers and defensive backs were most often involved in impacts with a larger closing distance and experienced the highest average LA behind quarterbacks. Helmet-to-body impacts generated significantly higher LA compared to helmet-to-helmet, though helmet-to-helmet occurred more often. Players involved in a tackle sustained significantly higher LAs than those involved in a block. Impacts in which players exhibited poor technique lead to higher LA and occurred more frequently in tackling versus blocking impacts. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The results of this work suggest that rules regarding offensive backfield running starts could be adjusted to decrease risk of impact after a larger closing distance. Behavioral modifications and coaching approaches aimed at improving tackling technique could decrease exposure to threshold impacts at the level of the individual player.","The paper investigates high magnitude subconcussive impacts in collegiate football by analyzing player and game characteristics that contribute to impact magnitude and frequency. Key findings indicate that specific play types, player positions, and poor tackling techniques are associated with higher linear acceleration during impacts, suggesting potential modifications to rules and coaching techniques to reduce injury risks."
Value of isokinetic strength testing for hamstring injury risk assessment: Should the ‘strongest’ mates stay ashore?,2020-11-16,,,,"Although isokinetic strength testing is commonly used in hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation and prevention, research findings concerning its predictive value remain inconclusive. Existing research focuses on peak torque (PT) and angle of PT, not analysing the torque behaviour throughout the testing range of motion (ROM). This study intended to assess the value of isokinetic curve evaluation in association with HSI. A sample of 116 male football players with and without a recent HSI history was submitted to bilateral isokinetic assessment of the knee and hip muscles. Raw isokinetic data were filtered and normalized prior to curve analysis submission in MATLAB. Torque development of each muscle group throughout the entire testing ROM was assessed using HSI history as an independent variable. Curve analysis revealed significant differences in torque behaviour in function of injury history. Players with an HSI history demonstrated significantly stronger concentric knee flexion and extension, eccentric knee extension and concentric hip extension patterns compared to the controls and their uninjured limb. HSI history was also associated with lower concentric hip flexion torques and lower mixed H:Q ratios compared to the control group and their contralateral limb. HSI history was associated with altered knee and hip muscle strength profiles, potentially due to isolated focus on local strength training in rehabilitation or mechanisms of neuromuscular inhibition. Because the differences in torque amplitude were range-dependent and did not systematically concur with the point of PT achievement, isokinetic strength evaluation should most probably be conducted using curve analysis.","This paper evaluates the predictive value of isokinetic strength testing for hamstring injury risk by analyzing torque behavior throughout the range of motion in male football players. Key findings indicate that players with a history of hamstring strain injuries exhibit altered muscle strength profiles, suggesting that isokinetic strength assessments should incorporate curve analysis rather than solely focusing on peak torque measurements."
The moderating impact of maturation on acute neuromuscular and psycho‐physiological responses to simulated soccer activity in academy soccer players,2020-11-16,,,,"AbstractResource constraints complicate load monitoring practices in some academies, which is problematic based on load-injury associations surrounding periods of rapid non-linear growth. Limited research has explored relationships between maturation and perceived psycho-physiological response to activity and associated neuromuscular performance changes. This study aimed to quantify neuromuscular and psycho-physiological responses to standardised activity and analyse whether dose-responses were moderated by maturation. Fifty-seven male soccer players (age: 14.1 ± 0.9 years; stature: 165 ± 10 cm; body mass, 57 ± 9 kg; percentage of predicted adult height 92.7 ± 5%) from two Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) academies completed the youth soccer-specific aerobic fitness test (Y-SAFT60). Countermovement jump (CMJ), reactive strength index (RSI), absolute (ABS) and relative leg stiffness (REL) were measured pre-post the Y-SAFT60 with playerload (PL), heart rate (HR), total distance (TDist) and differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) used as markers of load and intensity. A moderation model was employed to analyse interactions of maturation as a continuous variable. Analysis indicated no significant interaction (p <0.05) between maturation and neuromuscular performance but RPE-Technical demonstrated significant interactions (p = 0.01). Slope analysis indicated four variables (PL, RSI, ABS and REL) that demonstrated significance at various stages of maturation, most notably aligning with peak height velocity (∼87-96% PAH). Tentatively, we propose that maturational developments in the neuromuscular system offer some mechanistic explanation to the varied dose-responses observed. It is therefore important that maturation is habitually considered within prescription of training programmes and that further empirical studies are completed to determine maturity specific dose-responses.","This paper investigates the influence of maturation on the neuromuscular and psycho-physiological responses of academy soccer players during simulated activity. The findings highlight the need to consider maturation when designing training programs, as variations in neuromuscular performance and perceived exertion were observed, particularly around the peak height velocity stage."
Sprint and jump performances in highly trained young soccer players of different chronological age: Effects of linear VS. CHANGE–OF–DIRECTION sprint training,2020-11-13,,,,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of two different sprint-training regimes on sprint and jump performances according to age in elite young male soccer players over the course of one soccer season.Players were randomly assigned to two training groups. Group 1 performed systematic change-of-direction sprints (CODST, U19 [n = 9], U17 [n = 9], U15 [n = 10]) while group 2 conducted systematic linear sprints (LST, U19 [n = 9], U17 [n = 9], U15 [n = 9]). Training volumes were similar between groups (40 sprints per week x 30 weeks = 1200 sprints per season). Pre and post training, all players performed tests for the assessment of linear and slalom sprint speed (5-m and 10-m), countermovement jump, and maximal aerobic speed performance.For all physical fitness measures, the baseline-adjusted means data (ANCOVA) across the age groups showed no significant differences between LST and CODST at post (0.061 < p < 0.995; 0.0017 < d < 1.01). The analyses of baseline-adjusted means for all physical fitness measures for U15, U17, and U19 (LST vs. CODST) revealed no significant differences between LST and CODST for U15 (0.213 < p < 0.917; 0.001 < d < 0.087), U17 (0.132 < p < 0.976; 0.001 < d < 0.310), and U19 (0.300 < p < 0.999; 0.001 < d < 0.049) at post.The results from this study showed that both, LST and CODST induced significant changes in the sprint, lower limbs power, and aerobic performances in young elite soccer players. Since no significant differences were observed between LST and CODST, the observed changes are most likely due to training and/or maturation. Therefore, more research is needed to elucidate whether CODST, LST or a combination of both is beneficial for youth soccer athletes' performance development.","This study investigates the effects of linear sprint training (LST) versus change-of-direction sprint training (CODST) on sprint and jump performances in elite young male soccer players of varying ages over one season. The findings indicate that although both training regimes resulted in significant improvements in physical fitness measures, no significant differences were observed between the two training types, suggesting that changes may be attributable to general training or maturation rather than the specific method of sprint training."
Biomechanics of accurate and inaccurate goal-kicking in Australian football: Group-based analysis,2020-11-11,,,,"Goal-kicking is an important skill in Australian Football (AF). This study examined whether kinematic differences exist between accurate and inaccurate goal-kicks and determined the relationships between technical factors and accuracy. Eighteen elite to sub-elite AF players performed 15 x 30 m goal-kicks on an AF training ground, with three-dimensional kinematics collected using the Xsens inertial measurement system (Xsens Technologies B.V., Enschede, the Netherlands). A general linear mixed modelling approach and regression-based statistics were employed to quantify differences between accurate and inaccurate goal kicks and the relationships between technical factors and accuracy. Accurate goal-kicks were characterised by a straighter approach line, with less kick-leg joint range of motion (knee and hip), lower linear velocity (centre of mass, foot speed), angular velocity (knee and shank), and less support-leg knee flexion during the kicking phase compared to inaccurate goal-kicks. At the end of the follow through, players produced greater ankle plantarflexion and a straighter-leg line in accurate goal-kicks. Findings in this research indicated that many factors interact with goal-kicking accuracy in AF, ranging from the players’ approach line path, their support-leg mechanics, the kick-leg swing motion, to the final position of the kicker during their follow through.","This paper investigates the kinematic differences between accurate and inaccurate goal-kicking in Australian Football (AF) by analyzing the performances of elite to sub-elite players. Key findings reveal that accurate kicks are associated with a straighter approach line, reduced joint range of motion, and specific mechanics during both the kicking phase and follow-through, highlighting the complex interactions between technical factors and kicking accuracy."
Dynamic Knee Valgus in Single-Leg Movement Tasks. Potentially Modifiable Factors and Exercise Training Options. A Literature Review,2020-11-06,,,,"Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) as an incorrect movement pattern is recognized as a risk factor for lower limb injuries. Therefore, it is important to find the reasons behind this movement to select effective preventive procedures. There is a limited number of publications focusing on specific tasks, separating the double-leg from the single-leg tasks. Test patterns commonly used for DKV assessment, such as single-leg squat (SLS) or single leg landings (SLL), may show different results. The current review presents the modifiable factors of knee valgus in squat and landing single-leg tests in healthy people, as well as exercise training options. The authors used the available literature from PubMed, Scopus, PEDro and clinicaltrials.gov databases, and reviewed physiotherapy journals and books. For the purpose of the review, studies were searched for using 2D or 3D motion analysis methods only in the SLL and SLS tasks among healthy active people. Strengthening and activating gluteal muscles, improving trunk lateral flexion strength, increasing ROM dorsiflexion ankle and midfoot mobility should be taken into account when planning training programs aimed at reducing DKV occurring in SLS. In addition, knee valgus during SLL may occur due to decreased hip abductors, extensors, external rotators strength and higher midfoot mobility. Evidence from several studies supports the addition of biofeedback training exercises to reduce the angles of DKV.","This literature review examines dynamic knee valgus (DKV) as a risk factor for lower limb injuries during single-leg movement tasks. It highlights modifiable factors contributing to DKV in single-leg squats and landings and suggests exercise training options, including gluteal muscle strengthening and biofeedback training, to effectively reduce DKV in healthy individuals."
Biomechanical asymmetries persist after ACL reconstruction: results of a 2-year study,2020-11-06,,,,"This study was aimed to examine longitudinal (6, 12, 18, 24 months) asymmetries in double-leg landing kinetics and kinematics of subjects with and without unilateral ACLR.Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic parameters of 40 participants (n = 20 post-ACLR, n = 20 healthy) were collected with a motion analysis system and force plate during a drop-landing task, and asymmetry indices were compared between groups.The asymmetry index (AI) in the ACLR group compared to the healthy group decreased from six to 24 months for vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) from 100% to 6.5% and for anterior posterior ground reaction force (a-pGRF) from 155.5% to 7%. Also, the AI decreased for peak hip flexion moment from 74.5% to 17.1%, peak knee flexion moment from 79.0% to 5.8% and peak ankle dorsiflexion moment from 59.3% to 5.9%. As a further matter, the AI decreased for peak hip abduction moment from 67.8% to 5.1%, peak knee adduction moment from 55.7% to 14.8% and peak knee valgus angle from 48.7% to 23.5%.Results obtained from this longitudinal study showed that ACLR patients still suffer from limb asymmetries during landing tasks, which appear to normalize by 24-monthspost-surgery. This finding can help us to better understand biomechanics of the limbs after ACLR, and design more efficient post-surgery rehabilitation programs.Level III.","This study investigates the persistence of biomechanical asymmetries in double-leg landing kinetics and kinematics among individuals who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) over a two-year period.

Biomechanical Determinants of Knee Joint Loads Associated with Increased Anterior Cruciate Ligament Loading During Cutting: A Systematic Review and Technical Framework,2020-11-02,,,,"Abstract Background Cutting actions are associated with non-contact ACL injuries in multidirectional sports due to the propensity to generate large multiplanar knee joint loads (KJLs) that have the capacity to increase ACL loading and strain. Numerous studies have investigated the biomechanical determinants of KJLs in cutting tasks. The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively review the literature regarding biomechanical determinants of KJLs during cutting, in order to develop a cutting technical framework alongside training recommendations for practitioners regarding KJL mitigation. Methods Databases (SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and PubMed) were systematically searched using a combination of the following terms: “Biomechanical determinants”, or “Knee abduction moment”, or “Technical determinants”, or “Knee loading”, or “Knee loads”, or “Mechanical determinants”, or “ACL strain”, or “Knee adduction moment”, or “Anterior tibial shear”, or “Knee internal rotation moment”, or “Knee valgus moment” AND “Change of direction”, or “Cutting manoeuvre”, or “Run and cut”, or “Run-and-cut”, or “Sidestepping”, or “Side-stepping”, or “Shuttle run”. Inclusion criteria were as follows: studies examining a cutting task &lt; 110° with a preceding approach run that examined biomechanical determinants of KJLs using three-dimensional motion analysis. Results The search returned 6404 possibly eligible articles, and 6 identified through other sources. Following duplicate removal, 4421 titles and abstracts were screened, leaving 246 full texts to be screened for inclusion. Twenty-three full texts were deemed eligible for inclusion and identified numerous determinants of KJLs; 11 trunk, 11 hip, 7 knee, 3 multiplanar KJLs, 5 foot/ankle and 7 identifying ground reaction forces (GRFs) as determinants of KJLs. Conclusion Using the framework developed from the results, cutting KJLs can be mitigated through the following: reducing lateral foot-plant distances, thus lowering hip abduction and orientating the foot closer to neutral with a mid-foot or forefoot placement strategy; minimising knee valgus and hip internal rotation angles and motion at initial contact (IC) and weight acceptance (WA); avoiding and limiting lateral trunk flexion and attempt to maintain an upright trunk position or trunk lean into the intended direction; and finally, reducing GRF magnitude during WA, potentially by attenuation through increased knee flexion and emphasising a greater proportion of braking during the penultimate foot contact (PFC).","This paper systematically reviews the biomechanical determinants of knee joint loads (KJLs) associated with increased anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) loading during cutting actions in sports. It identifies key factors influencing KJLs and provides a technical framework and training recommendations to mitigate KJL risks, with a focus on strategies to optimize foot placement, minimize knee and hip internal motions, and control ground reaction forces during cutting maneuvers."
Concentric and eccentric isokinetic hamstring injury risk among 582 professional elite soccer players: a 10-years retrospective cohort study,2020-11-01,,,,"Background/Aim Different authors have tried to correlate the peak isokinetic torque values with the incidence of soccer match injuries. However, due to the wide variety of assessment testing protocols, such an inference becomes difficult. This study aimed to verify the capacity of an isokinetic test to establish injury risk reference values for hamstring strain injuries. Methods A retrospective cohort study based on isokinetic data and clinical records from the last 10 years was conducted in 582 Brazilian elite-professional soccer players, who were subjected to the same isokinetic test protocol, machine, and tester. A Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis for Complex Data Sampling was used to generate injury risk statistical indexes. Results Multivariate regression analysis of both legs provided important data to identify the cut-off values of Concentric Peak Torque (181.82 Newton/*metres), Concentric Work (236.23 watts) and Concentric Power (130.11 joules). Conclusions The injury risk indexes indicate that an increase of just one Newton unit in CPT (Concentric Peak Torque) and CJ (Concentric Power) above those cut-off values, can reduce the risk of future injuries by 2% and 2.7%, respectively.","This paper investigates the relationship between isokinetic hamstring strength and the risk of injuries among professional soccer players.

Long-term Stress Distribution Patterns Across the Ankle Joint in Soccer Players: A Computed Tomography Osteoabsorptiometry Study,2020-11-01,,,,"The distribution pattern of subchondral bone density is considered to accurately reflect the stress distribution over a joint under long-term physiologic loading. The biomechanical characteristics of the surface of the ankle joint in soccer players can be determined by measuring this distribution pattern under long-term loading.To evaluate the distribution of subchondral bone density across the ankle joint in soccer players and to determine the effects of soccer activities, including kicking motion, on the ankle joint surface under long-term loading conditions by computed tomography (CT) osteoabsorptiometry (CTOAM).Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.CT imaging data were obtained from both ankles of 10 soccer players (soccer group) and 10 nonathletic volunteers (control group). The distribution patterns of subchondral bone density across the articular surface of the ankle joints were assessed by CTOAM. Quantitative analysis was performed of the locations and percentages of high-density areas on the articular surface.Stress distribution patterns over the ankle joint differed between the soccer players and controls. In the soccer players, the high-density areas were found in the anterior part of the distal tibia and proximal talus as well as the distal fibula. The percentages of high-density areas were greater in the soccer players compared with controls (P < .0001).Stress distribution over the articular surface of the ankle joint was affected by soccer activities. A high stress concentration was seen in soccer players in the anterior part of the tibia and talus and in the fibula; such excessive stress may lead to anterior impingement.","The paper investigates the distribution of subchondral bone density across the ankle joint in soccer players using computed tomography osteoabsorptiometry. It finds that stress distribution patterns differ significantly from nonathletic controls, highlighting greater concentrations of high-density areas in specific regions of the ankle in players, which may contribute to conditions such as anterior impingement."
Instantaneous Whole-Brain Strain Estimation in Dynamic Head Impact,2020-10-31,,,,"Head injury models are notoriously time consuming and resource demanding in simulations, which prevents routine application. Here, we extend a convolutional neural network (CNN) to instantly estimate element-wise distribution of peak maximum principal strain (MPS) of the entire brain (>36 k speedup accomplished on a low-end computing platform). To achieve this, head impact rotational velocity and acceleration temporal profiles are combined into two-dimensional images to serve as CNN input for training and prediction of MPS. Compared with the directly simulated counterparts, the CNN-estimated responses (magnitude and distribution) are sufficiently accurate for 92.1% of the cases via 10-fold cross-validation using impacts drawn from the real world (n = 5661; range of peak rotational velocity in augmented data extended to 2–40 rad/sec). The success rate further improves to 97.1% for “in-range” impacts (n = 4298). When using the same CNN architecture to train (n = 3064) and test on an independent, reconstructed National Football League (NFL) impact dataset (n = 53; 20 concussions and 33 non-injuries), 51 out of 53, or 96.2% of the cases, are sufficiently accurate. The estimated responses also achieve virtually identical concussion prediction performances relative to the directly simulated counterparts, and they often outperform peak MPS of the whole brain (e.g., accuracy of 0.83 vs. 0.77 via leave-one-out cross-validation). These findings support the use of CNN for accurate and efficient estimation of spatially detailed brain strains across the vast majority of head impacts in contact sports. Our technique may hold the potential to transform traumatic brain injury (TBI) research and the design and testing standards of head protective gears by facilitating the transition from acceleration-based approximation to strain-based design and analysis. This would have broad implications in the TBI biomechanics field to accelerate new scientific discoveries. The pre-trained CNN is freely available online at https://github.com/Jilab-biomechanics/CNN-brain-strains.","This paper presents a method utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate peak maximum principal strain (MPS) in the brain during head impacts, achieving significant speed improvements in processing.

"Brain Injuries in American Football: Understanding the Injury, Difficulty in Helmet Optimization, and Current Communication Practices – A Narrative Review",2020-10-31,,,,"Background: Over 2.7 million people suffer traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) annually in the United States. TBI involves the application and generation of external forces and impulse loads respectively to the head whereby the brain moves relative to the skull. Despite numerous studies, further understanding of TBIs is necessary, requiring consistent attention. Objective: The purpose of this article is to investigate the history of American football helmets and provide an academic and practitioner review as it relates to TBIs. This study is a literature review that also considers perspectives from an autoethnographic frame. Method: An extensive literature review was performed to assess the history of TBI as it relates to American football. This article evaluates helmet design optimization and American football safety as well as an exploration into the sports’ education methods for players and staff alike. Results: Despite developing helmet designs that can better attenuate impact forces, reducing linear and rotational movement, the skull and brain move very differently relative to one another. Helmet designs and tools for measuring forces require further validation techniques to determine resultant forces and movement for the brain. Current biomechanics research lacks sufficient methodology for defining TBI thresholds, making helmet optimization difficult. Conclusion: According to past research, no helmet can eliminate all TBI risk; however, processes are in place lead by the National Football League (NFL) and NFL Players Association to educate players, coaches, and staff at all levels of competition of the protective capabilities of available helmet options.","This paper reviews the history and current state of helmet design in American football, focusing on the challenges of minimizing traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).

Effects of Strength vs. Plyometric Training on Change of Direction Performance in Experienced Soccer Players,2020-10-30,,,,"The purpose of this study was to compare how 6 weeks of strength- vs. plyometric training, which were matched upon direction of motion and workload, influences change of direction (COD) performance. Twenty-one experienced male soccer players (age: 22.2 ± 2.7) were pair-matched into a strength- (n = 10) and a plyometric (n = 11) training group. CODs of 45°, 90°, 135° and 180° performed from either a 4 m or 20 m approach distance were compared before and after intervention. Results showed no significant difference between groups. Significant effects were only found within the plyometric training group (-3.2% to -4.6%) in 90°, 135° and 180° CODs from 4 m and a 180° COD from a 20 m approach distance. Individual changes in COD performances showed that with the 4 m approach at least 55% and 81% of the strength and plyometric training group, respectively, improved COD performance, while with the 20 m approach at least 66% of both groups improved performance. This study showed that the plyometric training program can improve most CODs, with angles over 90°, although this is dependent on the distance approaching the COD. Considering the limited time of implementing physical conditioning, in addition to regular soccer practice in most soccer environments, the current plyometric training program can be advantageous in improving CODs at maximal intensity.","This study compares the effects of strength training versus plyometric training on change of direction (COD) performance in experienced soccer players over six weeks. While no significant differences were found between the two training groups, plyometric training notably improved COD performance at angles greater than 90° when approaching from a shorter distance, indicating its potential benefits in optimizing performance in soccer."
Male and female soccer players exhibit different knee joint mechanics during pre-planned change of direction,2020-10-29,,,,"Change of direction manoeuvres is important in soccer and associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury, yet it is not known how the mechanics differentiate between males and females during 180° turns. Twenty-eight soccer players (14 males and 14 females) performed 180° turns with ground reaction forces collected over penultimate and final contacts. A two-way (contact × limb) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were run to examine differences between contact (penultimate and final) or limb (dominant and non-dominant) for sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle peak angles and moments, and frontal plane knee abduction moments and angles between sexes. Average horizontal GRF was increased on the dominant limb, compared to non-dominant and for the final contact compared to the penultimate contact. Knee abduction angles were increased in females compared to males, while the opposite was true for knee abduction moments. Statistically significant differences were evident, with increases in peak vertical GRF, peak hip flexion angle, peak knee flexion angle, peak knee extensor moment, and peak ankle dorsiflexion angle observed in the penultimate contact compared to final contact. The results indicate the penultimate contact during turns helps reduce loading on the final contact, yet male and female soccer players exhibit different knee joint mechanics during pre-planned change of direction.","This paper investigates the differences in knee joint mechanics between male and female soccer players during pre-planned 180° change of direction maneuvers, which are critical for understanding non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Findings reveal that while females exhibit higher knee abduction angles, males demonstrate greater knee abduction moments, highlighting significant sex-based biomechanical differences during these maneuvers."
A New Strategy to Integrate Heath–Carter Somatotype Assessment with Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis in Elite Soccer Players,2020-10-27,,,,"Easy-to-apply and quick methods for evaluate body composition are often preferred when assessing soccer teams. This study aimed to develop new equations for the somatotype quantification that would reduce the anthropometric measurements required by the Heath and Carter method, integrating the somatotype assessment to the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). One hundred and seventy-six male elite soccer players (age 26.9 ± 4.5 years), registered in the Italian first division (Serie A), underwent anthropometric measurements and BIA. Endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy were obtained according to the Heath and Carter method, while fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) estimated using a BIA-derived equation specific for athletes. The participants were randomly split into development (n = 117) and validation groups (n = 59, 1/3 of sample). The developed models including resistance2/stature, FM%, FFM, contracted arm and calf circumference, triceps, and supraspinal skinfolds had high predictive ability for endomorphy (R2 = 0.83, Standard Error of Estimate (SEE) = 0.16) mesomorphy (R2 = 0.80, SEE = 0.36), and ectomorphy (endomorphy (R2 = 0.87, SEE = 0.22). Cross validation revealed R2 of 0.80, 0.84, 0.87 for endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy, respectively. The proposed strategy allows the integration of somatotype assessment to BIA in soccer players, reducing the number of instruments and measurements required by the Heath and Carter approach.","This paper presents a novel approach to integrate the Heath–Carter somatotype assessment with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for evaluating body composition in elite soccer players. The study develops new equations that require fewer anthropometric measurements while maintaining high predictive accuracy for endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy in a sample of 176 players."
INJURY PROFILE OF A SOCCER PLAYER TRAINING CENTER: AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY,2020-10-26,,,,"Objective: To carry out an epidemiological analysis characterizing the type and location of the injury, severity based on recovery time, game position, and injury for hours of exposure. Methods: Data collection was carried out in the sub 15, sub 17, and sub 20 categories and verified records made by the medical team of the club, which was trained to use the F-MARC form (a form of the medical research center of the International Football Federation-FIFA) at the beginning of the season. To perform the data analysis, the GraphPad Prism software was used. All variables were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results: In relation to the 129 athletes monitored during the season, 62 athletes presented some injury during the season, presenting 42.2 injuries for every 1000 hours of play, the Sub 15 category was the one with the highest incidence of injury, followed by the Sub17 and U20.

Decomposing the variability of match physical performance in professional soccer: Implications for monitoring individuals,2020-10-24,,,,"The aims of this study were to establish sources of variability in match physical performance of professional soccer players and provide a method for monitoring individual between-match changes. Eleven players meeting the final inclusion criteria were monitored through an entire in-season competition phase (n = 240 individual match observations). Ten Hertz global positioning systems were used to measure match total distance (TD), total high-speed running distance (≥ 21 km·h-1; HSRD), total accelerations (TAcc) and maximum running velocity (Vmax). Between-player, between-position, between-match and within-player variability were determined through linear mixed effects models. These data were then used to establish the practical significance of individual changes using a Minimum Effects Testing framework. All sources of variability were greater for HSRD (13-36%) when compared with all other metrics (<6%). Using combined between-match and within-player variability along with the smallest worthwhile change (0.2 × between-player SD), between-match individual changes of ±∼10-15% in TD, TAcc and Vmax were established as practically significant. For HSRD, these thresholds were considerably higher (≥60%). In conclusion, the ability for soccer practitioners to identify meaningful changes in match physical performance can aid decision making around player management following competition. Our study provides a method to flag changes beyond the normal match-to-match variability and by a substantial magnitude. This may have implications for recovery but should be combined with other sources of data (internal load and response) and used only as an adjunct to practitioner domain knowledge/experience.","This paper investigates the variability in match physical performance among professional soccer players, aiming to identify sources of this variability and propose a monitoring method for individual player changes between matches. The findings highlight that high-speed running distance exhibits greater variability compared to other metrics, with established significant thresholds for monitoring that can enhance player management post-competition."
Changes in the kinetics and kinematics of a reactive cut maneuver after successful athletic groin pain rehabilitation,2020-10-24,,,,"Athletic groin pain (AGP) is a chronic, painful condition which is prevalent in players of field sports that require rapid changes of direction. Following successful rehabilitation, systematic changes have been observed in the kinetics and kinematics of pre‐planned change of direction maneuvers, providing insight into potential foci for rehabilitation monitoring and for the assessment of interventions. However, changing direction in field sports is often reactive rather than pre‐planned, and it is not known whether such post‐rehabilitation changes are seen in reactive maneuvers. We analyzed the stance phase kinetics and kinematics of a 90° reactive cutting maneuver in 35 AGP patients before and after a successful exercise intervention program. Following the intervention, transverse plane rotation of the pelvis toward the intended direction of travel increased, and the body center of mass was positioned more anteriorly relative to the center of pressure. Ankle dorsiflexion also increased, and participants demonstrated greater ankle plantar flexor internal moment and power during the second half of stance. These findings provide insight into mechanical variables of potential importance in AGP, as identified during a maneuver based on a common sporting task.","The paper investigates the effects of rehabilitation on the kinetics and kinematics of a reactive cutting maneuver in athletes with groin pain. It identifies significant improvements in pelvis rotation, body center of mass positioning, and ankle dynamics following rehabilitation, shedding light on important mechanical factors relevant to athletic performance and recovery."
Effect of Novel Remodeled Bicycle Pedal Training on Balance Performance in Athletes With Functional Ankle Instability,2020-10-22,,,,"Appropriate training without risk of injury is a critical concern for athletes.

Hip Impingement after Anterior Inferior Iliac Spine Avulsion Fractures: A Case Report with Review of the Literature,2020-10-20,,,,"Avulsion fractures of the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) are rare injuries in adolescent athletes. We present a case of a 15-year-old male who sustained an avulsion injury to his right AIIS when kicking a soccer ball. The patient had chronic pain and extra-articular subspinal impingement leading to decreased hip flexion and rotation. The injury occurred 1.5 years prior to symptom onset, and we were the first health care providers to manage the injury. We attempted six months of nonoperative management including activity modifications and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy without improvement. Although this injury can often be managed nonoperatively, his symptoms required excision of the AIIS and associated heterotopic ossification. He had an excellent outcome with return to soccer and no pain at his final follow-up visit two years after surgery. Due to the limited literature guiding the surgeon’s management of AIIS avulsion injuries with associated heterotopic ossification, we provide a review of the literature detailing pre- and postoperative ranges of motion, surgical approach, fixation or excision of the avulsion fragment, and return to sport in this patient population.","This paper presents a case report of a rare anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) avulsion fracture in a 15-year-old soccer player, detailing the patient's initial symptoms, the ineffective nonoperative management, and the subsequent surgical intervention needed for recovery. It also includes a literature review that discusses surgical approaches, outcomes, and rehabilitation for similar injuries, highlighting the challenges in managing such cases among adolescent athletes."
Developmental sequences for observing and assessing forceful kicking,2020-10-19,,,,"While football/soccer is the most influential sport in the world, it is surprising that developmental sequences of forceful kicking have not been adequately described and validated in the literature. The purpose of this study was to explore potential developmental sequences for forceful kicking using a prelongitudinal screening method. Data were derived from videotapes of 255 children (girls n = 138, boys: n = 117), ages 4–11 years. Seven potential component sequences in their respective developmental order were initially proposed based on biomechanical and motor developmental principles. Each participant was digitally videoed performing five kicks with maximal effort. Trained research staff coded the initial seven components for each kick and the mode of each participant’s five kicks was used for data analysis. Component level probability curves for each component sequence across age were evaluated using the threshold based generalized partial credit model (Muraki, 1992) within the item response theory framework. As developmental theory would indicate, component levels generally increased with age for most components. Six component ordinal sequence progressions met model requirements (Rel = 0.88, item fit; p &gt; 0.05). Ordinal levels for two components ( Knee action and Follow-through) were altered based on initial empirical model structure fit and the Ball contact component was removed based on a lack of model fit. This study provides sufficient cross-sectional evidence for six component developmental sequences that adequately describe the development of kicking using cross-sectional data. Longitudinal data are required to provide further developmental validation for these sequences.","This paper investigates the developmental sequences of forceful kicking in children aged 4–11 years, using data from 255 video recordings. It identifies six ordinal component sequences of kicking development, demonstrating that component levels generally increase with age, although it calls for longitudinal data for further validation."
Oral contraceptive use and anterior cruciate ligament injury: comparison of active comparator new user cohort and case-control study designs,2020-10-18,,,,"This study further investigates a protective association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury noted in prior case-control studies.Active comparator new user cohort analysis of women aged 13-45 years in the United States from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database who newly-initiated low-dose OCs (exposed) or underwent intrauterine device (IUD) insertion (comparison group) from 2000 to 2014. Women were followed for ACL injury starting 90 days after OC initiation or IUD insertion until OC or IUD discontinuation or end of continuous enrollment. Adjusted hazard ratios (adjHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated controlling for age. Secondary analysis replicated previously-published case-control studies assessing ""ever"" versus ""never"" OC use over 1- and 5-year periods among women who underwent ACL reconstruction compared to age-matched controls.In the cohort analysis, 2,370,286 women initiated OCs and 621,798 underwent IUD insertion. There were 3571 (0.15%) ACL injuries during an average 370.6 days of continuous OC use and 1620 (0.26%) during an average 590.5 days of IUD use. No difference in risk of ACL injury was observed between OC initiators and IUD users (adjHR = 0.95; 95%CI 0.89, 1.01). The case-control analysis replicated the slight protective association observed in prior studies over a 5-year period (OR = 0.90; 95%CI 0.85, 0.94).This cohort study suggests no association between OC use and ACL injury, while the case-control study suggested bias from uncontrolled confounding and selection factors may have influenced previous findings that suggested a protective association between OC use and ACL injury.","This paper investigates the relationship between oral contraceptive (OC) use and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries through a cohort analysis and case-control study design. The findings indicate no significant difference in ACL injury risk between women using OCs and those who underwent IUD insertion, while previous studies suggested a slight protective association influenced by bias."
Factors affecting peak impact force during soccer headers and implications for the mitigation of head injuries,2020-10-16,,,,"It has been documented that up to 22% of all soccer injuries are concussions. This is in part due to players purposely using their head to direct the ball during play. To provide a more complete understanding of head trauma in soccer athletes, this study characterized the effects of four soccer ball characteristics (size, inflation pressure, mass, velocity) on the resulting peak impact force as it relates to the potential for incurring neurophysiological changes. A total of six hundred trials were performed on size 4 and 5 soccer balls as well as a novel lightweight soccer ball. Impact force was measured with a force plate and ball velocity was determined using motion capture. These data were used, in conjunction with dimensional analysis to relate impact force to ball size, mass, velocity, and pressure. Reasonable reductions in allowable ball parameters resulted in a 19.7% decrease in peak impact force. Adjustments to ball parameters could reduce a high cumulative peak translational acceleration soccer athlete down into a previously defined safer low loading range. In addition, it was noted that water absorption by soccer balls can result in masses that substantially increase impact force and quickly surpass the NCAA weight limit for game play. Additional research is required to determine whether varying soccer ball characteristics will enable soccer players to avoid persistent neurophysiological deficits or what additional interventions may be necessary and the legal implications of these data are discussed.","This paper investigates how various soccer ball characteristics (size, inflation pressure, mass, velocity) influence the peak impact force experienced during headers, aiming to better understand the potential for concussions in soccer players. The study finds that modifications in ball parameters can significantly reduce impact force, suggesting that such adjustments may mitigate the risk of neurophysiological injuries in athletes, while also highlighting the implications of water absorption on ball weight and safety."
An anatomically detailed and personalizable head injury model: Significance of brain and white matter tract morphological variability on strain,2020-10-10,,,,"Finite element head (FE) models are important numerical tools to study head injuries and develop protection systems. The generation of anatomically accurate and subject-specific head models with conforming hexahedral meshes remains a significant challenge. The focus of this study is to present two developmental works: first, an anatomically detailed FE head model with conforming hexahedral meshes that has smooth interfaces between the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid, embedded with white matter (WM) fiber tracts; second, a morphing approach for subject-specific head model generation via a new hierarchical image registration pipeline integrating Demons and Dramms deformable registration algorithms. The performance of the head model is evaluated by comparing model predictions with experimental data of brain-skull relative motion, brain strain, and intracranial pressure. To demonstrate the applicability of the head model and the pipeline, six subject-specific head models of largely varying intracranial volume and shape are generated, incorporated with subject-specific WM fiber tracts. DICE similarity coefficients for cranial, brain mask, local brain regions, and lateral ventricles are calculated to evaluate personalization accuracy, demonstrating the efficiency of the pipeline in generating detailed subject-specific head models achieving satisfactory element quality without further mesh repairing. The six head models are then subjected to the same concussive loading to study the sensitivity of brain strain to inter-subject variability of the brain and WM fiber morphology. The simulation results show significant differences in maximum principal strain and axonal strain in local brain regions (one-way ANOVA test, p < 0.001), as well as their locations also vary among the subjects, demonstrating the need to further investigate the significance of subject-specific models. The techniques developed in this study may contribute to better evaluation of individual brain injury and the development of individualized head protection systems in the future. This study also contains general aspects the research community may find useful: on the use of experimental brain strain close to or at injury level for head model validation; the hierarchical image registration pipeline can be used to morph other head models, such as smoothed-voxel models.","This paper focuses on the development of an anatomically detailed finite element head model for studying head injuries and enhancing protective systems. It introduces a novel hierarchical image registration pipeline to create subject-specific head models that account for individual variability in brain and white matter morphology, demonstrating significant differences in brain strain responses due to these anatomical variations."
"Performance on sprint, agility and jump tests have moderate to strong correlations in youth football players but performance tests are weakly correlated to neuromuscular control tests",2020-10-08,,,,"Abstract Purpose This study aimed at evaluating the correlation between seven different performance tests and two neuromuscular control tests in youth football players and to evaluate the influence of sex and age groups on test results. Methods One-hundred and fifteen football players (66 boys, 49 girls) mean age 14 ± 0.7 (range 13–16) years from youth teams were tested at the start of the second half of the competitive season. A test battery including agility t-test, 505 agility test, single-leg hop for distance test, side-hop test, countermovement jump test, 10-m sprint test, 20-m sprint test, tuck jump assessment (TJA) and drop vertical jump (DVJ) was completed. Results Correlations between the seven different performance tests of agility, jump and sprint ability were generally moderate to strong (r = 0.534–0.971). DVJ did not correlate with the performance tests (rho = 0.004 to – 0.101) or with TJA total score (rho = 0.127). There were weak to moderate correlations between TJA total score and the performance tests ( r = – 0.323–0.523). Boys performed better than girls in all performance tests ( p &lt; 0.001 ) and in TJA total score ( p = 0.002 ). In boys, older players performed better than younger players in the majority of the tests, while there was no clear age influence among girls. Conclusion Sprint performance was moderately to strongly correlated with agility and jump performance, and performance tests were weakly to moderately correlated to TJA, while DVJ did not correlate with the other tests. Boys performed better than girls on performance tests and TJA. An age effect on performance was evident in boys but not in girls. Level of evidence Level IV Trial registration Clinical Trials gov identifier: NCT03251404","This study evaluates the correlations between various performance tests (sprint, agility, and jump) and neuromuscular control tests in youth football players while considering the influences of sex and age.

Physiological and Performance Impacts After Field Supramaximal High-Intensity Interval Training With Different Work-Recovery Duration,2020-10-08,,,,"Due to great possibilities of handling the external load, the high intensity interval trainings (HIIT) could present different performances and physiological responses and even more so when these protocols are applied over ground. The present study aimed to evaluate the, performances, metabolic responses, and CK and LDH activities produced through two supra-maximum HIIT protocols in recreational endurance runners. Fifteen recreational male runners performed two HIIT protocols in randomized order with multiple conditions: 1) H15 (n=15) with a HIIT protocol of 15:15 work-recovery duration, and 2) H30 (n=15) with a HIIT protocol of 30:30 work-recovery duration. Both protocols were performed in similar intensity (130% vV̇O2max) and with one set until voluntary exhaustion. Blood samples were collected and estimated the levels and activities of blood lactate (BLac: mmol. L-1), glucose (GLU: mg. dL-1), creatine kinase (CK: U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: U/L). BLac and GLU were collected at pre, five and ten moments after the H15 and H30 protocols were performed. Blood collections used to measure the activities of CK and LDH enzymes were verified in the pre, 24 and 48 h after the protocols. Distance traveled (m), total time (s), and bouts performed (rep) were also registered. Significant differences between conditions H15 and H30 were observed in the bouts performed (p=0.001; ES=1.19). Several statistical differences were found over time for BLac [pre vs. post5' (both conditions: p=0.001), pre vs. post10' (both conditions: p=0.001), and post5' vs. post10' (H30: p=0.004)], CK [pre vs. post24 (H15: p<0.001; ES=0.97 and H30: p=0.001; ES=0.74) post 24 vs post48 (H30: p=0.03; ES=0.56)], and LDH [pre vs. post24 (H15: p=0.008; ES=1.07 and H30: p=0.022; ES=0.85). No statistical differences between conditions were observed for any blood parameter. In conclusion, both protocols generated similar performance and physiological responses, however, H30 showed a significant reduction in lactate and CK activities after 10 min and 48 h, respectively.","This study investigates the effects of two different high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols on performance and physiological responses in recreational endurance runners. It found that while both protocols (15:15 and 30:30 work-recovery durations) produced comparable performance outcomes, the H30 protocol led to a notable reduction in lactate and creatine kinase levels after specific recovery intervals."
The acute effects of one session reactive neuromuscular training on balance and knee joint position sense in female athletes with dynamic knee valgus,2020-10-08,,,,"The jump-landing movements can cause other non-ligamentous injuries such as bone and cartilaginous injuries (Aerts, Cumps, Verhagen, Verschueren, & Meeusen, 2013).The risk of injury may increase as a result of the faulty movement patterns (Padua et al., 2009).Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) as one of these faulty movement patterns is defined as a combination of excessive femoral adduction, internal rotation, tibial internal torsion and the medial movement of the knee (Lima et al., 2018).Movement patterns are modifiable risk factors for the injuries (Padua et al., 2009), and, the risk of ACL and other lower extremity injuries may be decreased by correcting faulty movement patterns.One of the causes of faulty movement patterns may be impaired joint position sense (JPS) as a component of proprioception.The proprioception is a broad concept that includes both the sense of body orientation and position, and a sense of body and limb motion (Bragonzoni et al.","This paper investigates the impact of reactive neuromuscular training on balance and knee joint position sense among female athletes exhibiting dynamic knee valgus, a movement pattern associated with a higher risk of injury. It emphasizes the importance of correcting faulty movement patterns and enhancing proprioception to potentially reduce the likelihood of ACL and other lower extremity injuries."
Factors Affecting Recurrent Lateral Ankle Sprain in Athletes,2020-10-07,,,,"Background: Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most common sports injuries that an athlete may endureduring their career. If not treated correctly, it often leads to recurrent twisting of the ankle joint, causingdisruption of the ligaments in the ankle joint. Various anthropometric factors such as height, weight, BMI, aswell as previous ankle sprain history are assessed as potential predictors of recurrent lateral ankle sprain. Thepotential factors are correlated with the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure- Sports Sub Scale to assess theircontribution to a recurrent lateral ankle sprain in athletes. The FAAM Sport subscale is used to determinethe functioning of the ankle joint, as recorded by the subjects themselves.Methodology: The questionnaire is sent to the candidates who fall under the inclusion criteria, and they areasked to fill the questionnaire. The participants were between the age of 18-30 years. Both male, as well asfemale athletes were included in the study. Each athlete must have played at least 3 competitive sports in thelast 1 year, and they must have a history of at least 1 lateral ankle sprain. The collected data is then compiledand analyzed.Result: After the analysis of the data, previous ankle sprain history depicted maximum correlation withthe FAAM- Sport Subscale, as well as an inverse relationship, with a reading of -2.89, and significance of0.27. Height depicted an inverse relationship as well, with -.119 when compared to FAAM Sport Sub-scale.Weight also shows an inverse relationship (-0.053) when correlated with the FAAM Sport sub-scale. BMIdoes not show any correlation with the FAAM Sport Subscale (+0.002).Conclusion: Previous ankle sprain history, height and weight depict an inverse relationship with the FAAMSport Subscale, indicating that, as their score increases, the functioning of the ankle joint decreases, andhence becoming a potential factor for recurrent ankle sprains. BMI however, does not depict any correlationwith the FAAM sport sub-scale.","The paper investigates the impact of various anthropometric factors, such as previous ankle sprain history, height, and weight, on the likelihood of recurrent lateral ankle sprains in athletes. The findings highlight that a history of ankle sprains significantly correlates with diminished ankle function, as measured by the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure - Sports Subscale, while BMI shows no significant relationship."
"Incidence, mechanisms and risk factors for shoulder injuries in community Australian football players",2020-10-06,,,,"Background: Australian football is a physically demanding sport. Exposure to multidirectional body contact and the necessity for complex upper body skills can result in significant strain on regions such as the shoulder. Despite the rise in incidence and high recurrence of shoulder injuries reported at the elite Australian Football League (AFL) level there is limited evidence available to determine whether shoulder injuries are also a problem at a community level. The financial ramifications of shoulder injuries for the community AFL player and society can be considerable due to time off work, treatment costs and the high number and expense of emergency department presentations.
Objectives: The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the profile (incidence, severity, mechanisms and clinical management) of shoulder complex injuries in community-level AFL players using automated injury surveillance (SMS text messaging and online survey). The thesis also aimed to investigate whether factors identified during preseason (i.e. musculoskeletal screening, measurement of habitual activity levels, or in-season training workload) were related to shoulder, head or neck time-loss injuries.
Methods: Study 1 and 2 prospectively evaluated a novel, automated method of injury surveillance in community AFL players (during a 20-week season) to assess method feasibility (Chapter 3) and to evaluate the profile of shoulder injuries (Chapter 4). In study 3, video footage of elite AFL players (n = 26) retrospectively examined the biomechanical aetiology of injuries to the shoulder complex (Chapter 5). The final two prospective cohort studies (4 and 5) examined potential risk factors for upper body injuries with similar injury mechanisms. At baseline, community AFL players were assessed using seven screening tests of the upper body, trunk and whole-body function to identify any relationships with in-season injuries to the shoulder, head, or neck (Chapter 6). Screening reference values were also determined. Pre-season habitual activity levels and in-season training workloads were collected to prospectively identify associations with in-season injuries to the upper or lower body regions (Chapter 7).
Results: The automated method of injury surveillance was deemed feasible for reporting injuries in community AFL players. The incidence of injuries to the shoulder complex was reported to be high (2nd highest in matches, 4th overall; 10.4% of all injuries). The severity of these shoulder injuries was mostly mild (<3 games missed), but a substantial number required medical attention (emergency department or doctor). Results also indicated activity mechanisms of injury were body region dependent with the majority of upper body injuries (shoulder, head and neck) due to collision contact. Injuries common to lower body regions (thigh, knee and ankle) were from non-contact/ overuse mechanisms. Video analysis of biomechanical aetiology identified that the majority of shoulder injuries occurred with the arm below 100 degrees flexion/ abduction and were caused by lateral contact (34.6%) and hyperflexion/ abduction (19.2%) mechanisms; potentially unavoidable contact injuries. This study found limited evidence to support the use of the suite of musculoskeletal screening tests selected for the upper body, trunk and whole-body function to identify risk of in-season injuries to the shoulder, head or neck. Furthermore, the results identified the variable nature of total workload characteristics in community AFL players, however, no total workload relationships were identified with common in-season injuries to the upper or lower body.
Conclusions: Shoulder injuries are problematic for community AFL players and the use of feasible methods of injury surveillance may help overcome the challenges associated with collecting shoulder injury data in community team sport. The musculoskeletal screening tests and measures of training and habitual workload selected and investigated in this thesis, however, were unable to adequately detect players ‘at-risk’ of an in-season injury to the shoulder, head or neck region. Future studies could investigate different intrinsic risk factors to the ones selected in this study and results also suggest that examination of extrinsic factors (such as rule changes) could possibly be indicated with an aim of preventing shoulder injuries. Furthermore, results from video analysis of elite players may suggest that prophylactic strategies should be customised to the positions of shoulder injury and also focus on lateral contact injury prevention in community AFL players. Findings from this thesis may help to inform the development of injury prevention strategies and guide future research directions with an aim of decreasing injuries to the shoulder complex in community AFL players.","This paper investigates the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors of shoulder injuries among community Australian football players, highlighting the significant strain on the shoulder due to multidirectional contact and complex skills involved in the sport. Using automated injury surveillance and video analysis, the study finds that shoulder injuries are prevalent, often resulting from collision contact, but musculoskeletal screening methods failed to identify at-risk players, suggesting the need for alternative strategies for injury prevention."
Sports Specific Injury Pattern of Sportspersons,2020-10-01,,,,"Objective: Previous researches on sports injuries primarily focused on specific games or sports or on specific types of injuries.None of them had tried to explore the injury patterns of games and sports altogether.The current study tried to explore the injury patterns of sportspersons over 16 different types of games and sports.Materials and methods: Total of 1008 injury cases (649 male and 369 female, age 21.07±2.78and 20.81± 3.01 years) between the academic sessions 2008 to 2017 were analysed.Injury data were extracted from the institute injury record book.Apart from age and gender, ' Body site of injury ', ' Types of injury ' and ' Recurring of injury ' were selected as variables for the study.Descriptive statistics, bar and pie diagram were generated using crosstabs function of IBM SPSS.Results: An average 101.80±12.59injury was reported per year.Footballers were found to be the highest injured sportsperson (19.5%).Injury percentage of male players (63.75%) was higher compared to female (36.25%) counterparts.Lower limb area (45.28%) was found to be the highest affected body site of injury followed by upper limb area (29.47%).Acute injury constituted 50.39% of overall injuries.Most injuries were non-recurring in nature (63.65%).Further different combinations of analysis revealed more insight of injury patterns of sportspersons.","The paper examines the injury patterns among sportspersons across 16 different sports, analyzing data from 1008 injury cases over nearly a decade. Key findings indicate that footballers have the highest injury rates, with a notable prevalence of lower limb injuries and a majority of injuries being acute and non-recurring."
"Clinical and radiological hip parameters do not precede, but develop simultaneously with cam morphology: a 5-year follow-up study",2020-10-01,,,,"Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was to (1) investigate whether radiographic and clinical parameters, which influence how stresses during sporting activities act on the proximal femur, are associated with cam morphology or (2) precede cam morphology development. Methods Young male football players participated at baseline ( n = 89, 12–19 years of age), 2.5-year ( n = 63) and 5-year follow-up ( n = 49). Standardized anteroposterior pelvic and frog-leg lateral radiographs were obtained at each time-point. Cam morphology was quantified by an alpha angle ≥ 60°, and large cam morphology ≥ 78°. The neck–shaft angle (NSA), epiphyseal extension (EE), lateral center–edge angle (LCEA) and hip internal rotation (IR) were also measured. Cross-sectional associations between NSA, EE, LCEA and IR and (large) cam morphology were studied at all time-points. To study whether these variables preceded cam morphology development, hips without cam morphology at baseline were studied prospectively. Results A lower NSA, a higher EE and limited IR were consistently associated with cam morphology at all three time-points. These differences were more pronounced in hips with large cam morphology. No association between cam morphology and the LCEA was found. None of the parameters studied preceded cam morphology development. Conclusion Cam morphology developed simultaneously with a varus orientation, growth plate extension towards the femoral neck and limited hip internal rotation. These parameters did not precede cam morphology development. The hip parameters studied cannot be used to identify individuals at risk of developing cam morphology. Level of Evidence: Level II.","This study investigates the relationship between clinical and radiological hip parameters and cam morphology in young male football players over a 5-year follow-up. It finds that while lower neck-shaft angle, higher epiphyseal extension, and limited internal rotation are associated with cam morphology, these parameters do not precede its development, indicating simultaneous progression rather than predictive capability."
REPEATABILITY OF SWAY MEASURES IN UPPER EXTREMITY WEIGHT-BEARING,2020-10-01,,,,"Analysis of upper extremity weight bearing ability is important for athletes as some function largely in a closed chain capacity (e.g., wrestling, football, gymnastics); also, all require closed chain upper extremity function during strength and conditioning. Additionally, in a rehabilitation setting, closed chain upper extremity functional testing is often used as a return to play criterion. Lower extremity sway measures (biomechanical and clinical) have been published widely and have established reliability and validity; however, the reliability of upper extremity sway biomechanical measures has not been investigated to date.The purpose of this study was to determine the repeatability of a variety of force plate measurements during an upper extremity task in an athletic population. It was hypothesized that variables measuring upper extremity sway in a closed kinetic chain position would have excellent reliability.Cross-sectional.All data were collected using a force plate system with commercially available software. Four hundred and ninety healthy Division I athletes were tested for both their dominant and non-dominant upper extremity at one of two testing sessions. Subjects were instructed to stay as still as possible while maintaining a full plank position with one upper extremity on the force plate and the contralateral upper extremity behind their back. Two, 20-second trials were performed for each extremity. Variables measured included average sway velocity (ASV), sway velocity in medial-lateral (SVML) and anterior-posterior (SVAP) directions, sway velocity at 1st and 2nd time intervals for AP (VAP1 and 2) and ML (VML1 and 2) directions, and sway frequency in the AP direction for 1st and 2nd time intervals (FreAP1 and 2). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(2,1)) and their 95% confident intervals were calculated for all force plate variables for 980 limbs.No difference was seen between left and right extremities for any measure (p > 0.05). ICC's ranged from 0.61-0.90 for all variables, indicating moderate to excellent reliability for all variables.Upper extremity sway biomechanical variables using a force plate system have moderate to excellent reliability. These results are important prior to validation and clinical utilization of these measures including baseline testing, return to play guidelines, and injury prevention parameters.3.","This paper investigates the repeatability of upper extremity sway measurements in weight-bearing tasks among athletes, focusing on the reliability of various force plate measurements. The study found that these biomechanical variables displayed moderate to excellent reliability, underscoring their potential utility in clinical settings for injury prevention and return-to-play assessments."
An Experimental Model on Multiple Regression Analysis in CMJ and SJ Jump Tests on 10-14 Years Old Players of Tirana Football Club,2020-10-01,,,,"In vertical jump performance, the goal of the task is simply to jump as high as possible.In many sports, the height at which an athlete can jump is often of critical importance, as well as the maximal force applied during the vertical jump.In the absence of resistance to air and other external forces, the projection of the center of gravity COG of the whole body is completely determined by the vertical velocity at the moment of takeoff and the acceleration due to gravity.However, this quality does not fully describe the full jump and height achieved.This study aims to use the multiple regression method in both CMJ and SJ vertical jump tests, to understand whether vertical jump performance for Hmax and Fmax respectively parameters, can be predicted based on anthropometric variables such as: age, height, and body mass, as well as biomechanical variables such as: vmax, F.tot.rel, EFI and efficiency.Multiple regression method allows to determine the overall fit of the model and the relative contribution of each of predictor to the total variance explained.The equations of regression for this team emerged these parameters as the best predictor of the main variables for each test: for Hmax in CMJ test: vmax and body mass; and for Fmax in SJ test: body mass and Pmax/kg.","This paper investigates the relationship between vertical jump performance and various anthropometric and biomechanical variables in young football players, specifically using multiple regression analysis on counter-movement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) tests. Key findings indicate that factors such as vertical velocity and body mass are significant predictors of jump height and maximum force, highlighting the importance of these characteristics in assessing athletic performance in youth football."
The Effects of Changing Footstrike Pattern on the Amplitude and Frequency Spectrum of Ground Reaction Forces During Running in Individuals With Pronated Feet,2020-10-01,,,,"Purpose: The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of barefoot and shod running with two different styles on ground reaction force-frequency content in recreational runners with low arched feet. Methods: The statistical sample of this research was 13 males with Pronated Feet (PF) (Mean±SD age: 26.2±2.8 y; height: 176.1±8.4 cm; weight: 78.3±14.3 kg). A force plate (Bertec, USA) with a sample rate of 1000 Hz was used to record the reaction forces under each foot. Three test conditions in our study included shod running with rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot patterns. Repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for analyzing the data. Results: During forefoot running, the research subjects attained 10% higher GRF values in vertical direction, compared with rearfoot running (P˂0.001, d=2.133). Forefoot running decreased the peak vertical GRF, compared to rearfoot running (by 12%, P=0.01, d=0.826). Barefoot running decreased the peak vertical GRF, compared to shod running (by 6%, P=0.027, d=1.143). The collected results revealed a significantly lower FyMed (P&lt;0.02, d=1.11, 14%), Fy99.5% (P&lt;0.02, d=0.11, 8%), and greater FyNe (P&lt;0.02, d=0.72, 10%), Fz99.5% (P&lt;0.01, d=4.30, 124%), and FzNe (P&lt;0.01, d=1.65, 44%) when running with rearfoot strike pattern, compared with forefoot strike pattern. Conclusion: The study subjects with pronated feet experienced greater GRF values during forefoot running than rearfoot; such data may imply an increased risk of running injuries. Therefore, forefoot running is not recommended for runners with pronated feet.","This study examines the impact of different footstrike patterns (rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot) on ground reaction forces (GRF) in recreational runners with pronated feet. Results indicate that forefoot running generates higher vertical GRF compared to rearfoot running, suggesting potential injury risks for runners with pronated feet, leading to the conclusion that forefoot running may not be advisable for this group."

Accordingly, this proposal aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tDCS and RT training in choice RT and cognitive function during recreational soccer. <bold>Methods:</bold> In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of 30 recreational soccer players, tDCS will be applied in the primary motor cortex (M1). Participants will be divided into (1) anodal tDCS plus RT training and (2) sham tDCS plus RT training. The investigator will be blinded to patient treatment before the first session, last session, and 1 day after the last tDCS session. In total, 15 sessions will be performed using a schedule of three times a week for 5 weeks. The RT training protocol will be delivered during tDCS and will comprise kicking a ball from a platform, placed on either the right or the left side, depending on a light cue, during a 10-min interval (between minute 5 and minute 15 after 20-min stimulation). Changes in choice RT in the upper and lower limbs will be considered primary outcome measures, and changes in Trail Making Test and Digit Span Test will be considered secondary outcome measures. Any adverse effects during the study period will be reported. To detect changes in continuous outcomes, a the anodal tDCS and the sham mode will be compared using a t-test for normal distribution, or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for non-normal distribution; changes will be considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. <bold>Discussion: </bold>The FAST trial is a new proposal that uses a novel method of evaluation and training of choice RT in soccer players through a functional task. The anodal tDCS along with choice RT training with a functional task can be an efficient tool for athletes to prevent injuries.

Najčešće ozljede kod nogometaša,2020-09-08,,,,"Objective: The main objective of this research is to show the most common injuries in football players and, by clustered analysis, link those injuries with position on field, recovery time, league, and age.
 Study design: Cross-sectional study
 Participants and methods: The research included 110 adult football players from Slavonia and Baranja who play football either for recreational purposes, semi-professionally or professionally. All participants agreed to be part of the anonymous online survey. A program used for statistical analysis was MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.1.7. The normality of the distribution of numerical variables was tested by Shapiro - Wilk test. Numerical data are described by median and interquartile range.
 Results: The ankle injury is the most common in football players, followed by hamstrings injury and wrist bone fractures. Ankle injury is found in all sports positions, while rotator cuff muscle injury is typical for goalkeepers. We did not find a difference in injuries between individual leagues. The correlation between injuries and the duration of recovery is found only in specific injuries such as wrist bone fractures, forearm and upper arm fractures as well as tennis elbow, lasting one month. We did not find correlation between age and injury, or between recovery time and age. We were unable to differentiate a specific physiotherapy procedure with individual injuries.
 Conclusion: The most common injury in football players is ankle injury, which is related to all playing positions. Due to the biomechanics and kinesiology, goalkeepers have problems with the rotator cuff muscles. The specificity of injuries determines the recovery time. Larger number of respondents within all Croatian leagues and a more detailed description of injuries are needed to make the results more credible.","This research examines the most frequent injuries among football players, emphasizing ankle injuries as the most prevalent across all positions. It identifies specific injury patterns related to player roles, while noting that injury recovery times vary based on the type of injury rather than player age or league affiliation."
Using Sports to Attract Young Women into Engineering,2020-09-03,,,,"Abstract Using Sports to Attract Young Women into EngineeringEngineering, science and technology are used extensively in sports - from equipment design,increasing athletic performance, safety, health benefits and enjoyment, to preventing injury andassuring equity and longevity in sports. Yet for some individuals, sports and recreation may beassociated with the word “fun”, while science, math and engineering may be equated with thewords “hard” or “difficult”. Get SSET (Sport Science, Engineering and Technology) was firstdeveloped in 2003 as an innovative week-long summer residential sports engineering academyfor girls entering grades 9 through 11. The academy has been conducted at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and the University of San Diego.The academy focuses on empowering female students with technical skills and success strategiesthrough exciting sports STEM lectures and hands-on activities in a gender-neutral environment.A key component of the program is that instructors are university faculty and/or professionals insports science, engineering or math. The on-campus environment is used as a stimulus to excitestudents about college/university education and an engineering, science, math or technologyrelated career.The presentation and paper will cover best practices developed over the past nine years,including academy logistics (funding, costs, “after-hour” classroom engagement, studentselection criteria, academy schedule of activities) and share the variety of classroom content thathas been used. For example, past academies have included design methodology for an equestriansaddle for a paraplegic, athletic footwear design for a triathlete, and wind tunnel testing ofstudent redesigned cycling helmets for drag reduction. Additionally, a summary of studentlongitudinal tracking, student evaluations and parent surveys (conducted 2-4 months after theacademy) will be provided.In sports engineering it is critical to understand and embrace physiological differencesthroughout the human life cycle (age), for both genders and for varying physical abilities anddisabilities. This theme has been used throughout the academy to emphasize that understandingdiversity is critical in obtaining good sports engineering solutions.","This paper discusses the use of sports as a means to engage young women in STEM fields, particularly engineering.

Force experienced by the head during heading is influenced more by speed than the mechanical properties of the football,2020-09-02,,,,"There are growing concerns about the risk of neurodegenerative diseases associated with heading in football. It is essential to understand the biomechanics of football heading to guide player protection strategies to reduce the severity of the impact. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of football speed, mass, and stiffness on the forces experienced during football heading using mathematical and human body computational model simulations. Previous research indicates that a football header can be modeled as a lumped mass mathematical model with elastic contact. Football headers were then reconstructed using a human body modeling approach. Simulations were run by independently varying the football mass, speed, and stiffness. Peak contact force experienced by the head was extracted from each simulation. The mathematical and human body computational model simulations indicate that the force experienced by the head was directly proportional to the speed of the ball and directly proportional to the square root of the ball stiffness and mass. Over the practical range of ball speed, mass, and stiffness, the force experienced by the head during football heading is mainly influenced by the speed of the ball rather than its mass or stiffness. The findings suggest that it would be more beneficial to develop player protection strategies that aim to reduce the speed at which the ball is traveling when headed by a player. Law changes reducing high ball speeds could be trialed at certain age grades or as a phased introduction to football heading.","The paper investigates the forces experienced by a player's head during football heading and how they are influenced more by the speed of the ball than by its mass or stiffness. Using mathematical and computational modeling, the study concludes that player protection strategies should focus on reducing ball speed rather than altering the mechanical properties of the ball."
The bumpy road to effective hamstring injury prevention in male amateur soccer players,2020-09-02,,,,"Hamstring injuries are the most common muscle injuries in soccer and therefore a major concern in male amateur soccer players. Besides the high incidence, these injuries cause long absence of play and have high reinjury rates. Although numerous studies have been executed to reduce hamstring injury incidence in soccer players, ... read more the incidence actually increased. The hamstring injury seems to be difficult to prevent. “The bumpy road to effective hamstring injury prevention in male amateur soccer players” describes studies about preventing the first hamstring injury and about safe return to play after a hamstring injury. With these studies, we come another step closer to the solution for the hamstring injury problem. This thesis contains, studies about risk factors, reasons to (not) execute injury prevention programs as prescribed and studies about effects of jump training to prevent hamstring injuries prevention and to improve performance. This thesis has been established in close collaboration with the KNVB and underlines the complexity of the hamstring injury. Surprisingly the results were not as expected. An effective hamstring injury prevention program that reduced hamstring injury incidence by 2/3, is hardly executed in daily soccer practice. Furthermore, jump training was thought to be effective for multiple reasons. We found no preventive effect on hamstring injuries, but jump training did improve performance. In conclusion, an effective hamstring injury prevention program is hardly executed in daily practice and jump training improves performance but does not prevent hamstring injuries. The search for a solution for the hamstring injury problem continues. show less","The paper discusses the challenges of preventing hamstring injuries among male amateur soccer players, highlighting that despite various studies and proposed programs, the incidence rates of these injuries remain high.

"Gender differences in instep soccer kicking biomechanics, investigated through a 3D human motion tracker system",2020-09-01,,,,"This study aims at describing and comparing each other male and female soccer players kicking instep a stationary ball. The different measures we collected by the 3D motion capture system Movit G1 and the High-Speed Camera (240 fps) were considered as dependent variables, whereas the gender was considered as the independent one.Twenty soccer well trained non-professional players: 10 men (age: 25.3±6.5 yrs; height 1.80±0.07 m; body mass 76.9±13.2 kg) and 10 women (age: 19±3.34 yrs; height 1.64±0.07 m; body mass 58.2±7.2 kg) volunteered to participate in the study.Gender differences were found, with a statistical significance (P<0.05) or interesting magnitude (Cohen d>0.5). The most relevant ones were the differences in hip extension of the kicking leg when the foot of the supporting one touches the ground, just before the impact on the ball (independent sample t-Test; P=0.03; Cohen d=1.64) and the speed of the ball, reached immediately after kicking (P<0.001;d=1.23).These results, together with the greater pelvic acceleration shown by men compared to women, highlight the need to develop a gender-differentiated training model, in order to customize the kicking technique in women and to reduce the likelihood, currently higher than for men, of kicking related injuries.","This study investigates gender differences in the biomechanics of instep soccer kicking using a 3D motion capture system, focusing on a comparison between male and female players.

Asymptomatic Professional Footballers: Prevalence of Ankle Retinacula Injury with Associated Lateral Ligament and Tendon Abnormalities,2020-09-01,,,,"Background.The retinacula are important dynamic stabilizers around the ankle joint and are susceptible to potential injury in high-level footballers.Aim.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of retinacula injury in asymptomatic professional football players and for the presence of associated ankle tendon or ligament abnormalities.Methods.Seventeen professional football players from one English premier league club underwent ultrasound examination of both ankles.The retinacula around the ankle were measured for thickness and compared with normal values.Ankle tendons were evaluated for the presence of abnormal vascularity or tendinopathy, tendon sheath effusions, and for peroneal tendon subluxation.Lateral ankle ligaments were also examined.Results.The results indicated increased thickness of the retinacula at the following sites: superior extensor retinaculum on the medial side(1.5 mm, normal 0.9 mm) ; superior peroneal retinaculum at the anterior insertion (2.16 mm, normal 1 mm); and flexor retinaculum at the anterior insertion into the tibia (1.78 mm, normal.0.9 mm).Fluid around the tibialis posterior tendon was a frequent finding representing 74%, whilst over 25% revealed fluid within the peroneal tendon sheaths.Over 50% of the scans revealed thickened and abnormal lateral ligament complexes.Conclusions.The thickening of the retinacula may indicate scarring from previous injury or repetitive micro-trauma, attributable to the ball kicking biomechanics, kinematics and contact injuries during tackles.Furthermore tendon sheath fluid was commonly seen on both the medial and lateral side of the ankle.We conclude that chronic scarring and thickening of these structures should be recognized as a common and often incidental finding and the significance in asymptomatic professional footballers is minimal.","The paper investigates the prevalence of ankle retinacula injury and associated tendon and ligament abnormalities in asymptomatic professional football players. Findings reveal that the retinacula were significantly thicker than normal, with a high incidence of fluid around ankle tendons and abnormal lateral ligament complexes, suggesting chronic scarring and thickening may often be incidental in elite athletes."
Inter-limb step asymmetry in closed and open skill sprint accelerations in soccer players,2020-08-27,,,,"Purpose Inter-limb differences may decrease sports performance. There is a need to understand the comparison of asymmetries between open and closed skill tasks. The study investigated inter-limb step asymmetry responses to closed and open skill acceleration sprint running tasks. Methods 3D motion analysis kinematic data of step characteristics were collected from 20 male soccer players (mean ± SD: 21 ± 1.9 years, 78.7 ± 7.7 kg, 1.78 ± 0.06 m) for bilaterally located lower-limb markers during the initial 20 m of closed and open skill acceleration sprint running trials. Step velocity, step length, step frequency, flight time, contact time, and flight distance were calculated. In the closed skill conditions, players knew the final sprint distance before initiation. In the open skill conditions, players were informed of the final sprint distance (20 or 40 m) immediately after run initiation. Results Significant asymmetries (0.10–10.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in step characteristics were observed during closed skill acceleration sprint performances. Positive correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;: 0.51–0.77, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were evidenced between asymmetry scores in the closed skill and in the open skill 20-m and 40-m conditions. Asymmetry scores were not associated with sprint performance (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;: from –0.13 to 0.30, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05), suggesting that asymmetry may be functional or dysfunctional. Conclusions Skilled soccer players can regulate step characteristic asymmetries across closed and open skill tasks. Symmetry should not be assumed when assessing open and closed skill acceleration sprint performance in soccer players. Practitioners should be aware of these asymmetries when implementing programmes.","This paper investigates inter-limb step asymmetry in soccer players during closed and open skill acceleration sprint tasks. The study finds that significant asymmetries exist in closed skill conditions, but these asymmetries do not correlate with sprint performance, highlighting the need for practitioners to consider these differences when developing training programs."

Effect of Different Knee Braces in ACL-Deficient Patients,2020-08-26,,,,"Knee braces are often used during rehabilitation after ACL injury. There are two main concepts, rigid and soft braces, but studies comparing the two show conflicting results. Most studies used movement tasks with low translational or rotational loads and did not provide joint kinematics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of two different knee braces (rigid vs. soft) on knee joint kinematics in ACL-deficient patients compared to an unbraced control condition using two tasks (walking and 180° cutting) provoking knee movements in the frontal and transverse planes. 17 subjects with ACL-deficient knees participated in this study. 3D knee joint kinematics were recorded. To provoke frontal plane knee joint motion a laterally tilting plate was applied during a walking task. Both braces reduced the maximum valgus angle compared to the unbraced condition, stabilizing the knee joint against excessive valgus motion. Yet, no differences in peak abduction angle between the two braces were found. However, a significant extension deficit was observed with the rigid brace. Moreover, both braces increased transverse plane RoM and peak internal rotation angle, with the effects being significantly larger with the rigid brace. These effects have been associated with decreased knee stability and unphysiological cartilage loading. Therefore, the soft brace seems to be able to limit peak abduction with a lesser impact on physiological gait compared to the rigid brace. The cutting task was selected to provoke transverse plane knee movement and large external knee rotation was expected. However, none of the braces was able to reduce peak external knee rotation. Again, an increase in transverse plane RoM was observed with both braces. Based on these results, no brace outmatched the other in the second task. This study was the first attempt to clarify the effect of brace design for the stabilization of the knee joint during movements with frontal and transverse plane loading. However, to provide physicians and patients with a comprehensive guideline for brace usage, future studies will have to extent these findings to other daily or sportive movement tasks.","This paper investigates the effects of rigid and soft knee braces on knee joint kinematics in ACL-deficient patients during walking and cutting tasks. The study finds that while both braces stabilize the knee against excessive valgus motion and affect knee range of motion, the soft brace performs better in maintaining physiological gait compared to the rigid brace, indicating the need for further research to provide comprehensive guidelines for brace usage in various tasks."
Influence of age and sex on drop jump landing strategies in élite youth soccer players,2020-08-25,,,,"The vertical drop jump (VDJ) test evaluates frontal-plane knee control in a controlled environment. Age- and sex-related changes in landing and bouncing mechanisms in youth soccer players are still under investigated. This study characterizes knee biomechanics in a large cohort of élite academy players, stratified by sex and age group. A sample of 189 young soccer players (132 male U10-U12 and U14-U17, 57 females U10-U14) from the Academy of a professional “Serie A” Italian club were tested. Motion capture technology was used to obtain sagittal and frontal plane knee angles, as well as VDJ landing asymmetry and peak vertical ground reaction forces at push-off. Landing kinetics and kinematics changed as a function of age and sex in youth élite soccer players: (i) males and females showed different landing load asymmetry between dominant and non-dominant leg, peak push-off force and knee flexion even before puberty, (ii) landing asymmetry tended to reduce in older players and (iii) knee varus increased in males after adolescence. In conclusion, besides its role in injury prevention, the VDJ can help in monitoring players’ growth and development, and this process should start at an early age. This data collection could be used as a tool for further screening test to highlight anomalous landing behaviour.","This paper examines the influence of age and sex on landing strategies during drop jumps in elite youth soccer players, utilizing motion capture technology to analyze knee biomechanics. It finds that males and females exhibit distinct landing asymmetries and changes in knee alignment with age, highlighting the importance of these assessments for injury prevention and monitoring player development from a young age."
Relating on-field youth football head impacts to pneumatic ram laboratory testing procedures,2020-08-20,,,,"A youth-specific football helmet testing standard has been proposed to address the physical and biomechanical differences between adult and youth football players. This study sought to relate the proposed youth standard-defined laboratory impacts to on-field head impacts collected from youth football players. Head impact data from 112 youth football players (ages 9–14) were collected through the use of helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays. These head impacts were filtered to only include those that resided in corridors near prescribed National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) impact locations. Peak linear head acceleration and peak rotational head acceleration magnitudes collected from pneumatic ram impactor tests as specified by the proposed NOCSAE youth standard were compared to the distribution of on-field head impacts. All laboratory impact tests were among the top 10% in terms of magnitude for Severity Index and peak rotational acceleration of matched location head impacts experienced by youth football players. As concussive head impacts are among the most severe impacts experienced on the field, a safety standard geared toward mitigating concussion should assess the most severe on-field head impacts. This proposed testing standard may be refined as more becomes known regarding the biomechanics of concussion among youth athletes.","This paper presents a proposed youth-specific football helmet testing standard aimed at addressing the unique physical and biomechanical characteristics of youth football players. It correlates on-field head impact data from 112 youth players to laboratory tests, highlighting that the most severe on-field impacts align with the proposed testing parameters, suggesting a need for ongoing refinement of concussion-related safety standards in youth sports."

The Professional Contribution of Chiropractors to Danish elite football clubs: A qualitative exploration of role and perceived value in an interprofessional service provision context.,2020-08-18,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> Background: Interprofessional team-based care has been widely adopted in elite level athletic health and performance practice. Although chiropractors can claim some penetration as health care service providers in high level sport, their position as valued members of interprofessional health care teams, especially those built around traditional medical organisational structures, is unclear. As a first step to map the professional practice landscape of Danish sports chiropractors, this investigation sought to explore the perceived role and value of chiropractors as service providers in elite Danish football clubs. Methods: A comparative qualitative case study using semi-structured individual interviews was conducted. Six Danish Superliga clubs were purposively sampled to compare and contrast instances where chiropractors were absent from the health care team, contracted as in-house health care team members or engaged as external service providers. Triangulated responses were solicited from healthcare co-ordinators, chiropractors and athletes within each club’s organisation through short semi-structured individual interviews. The audio-recorded responses were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using a framework approach. Results: Inductive and deductive coding revealed 14 unique codes, which were further organised into 4 code families relating to the role of chiropractors, benefits of utilizing chiropractic care and facilitators and barriers to interprofessional practice. From this framework 3 themes were abstracted, these being: “Broadening horizons”, “In-house preferred to take-away” and “Already covered, or even necessary?”. Conclusion: In this practice context, chiropractors fill the role of musculoskeletal health care service providers. Their perceived value stems from additional expert disciplinary knowledge, improved diagnostic triage and increased treatment flexibility. However, where not utilized, the role of the spinal health expert is questioned and when acknowledged, limited to that of a technician/therapist. It is unclear whether chiropractors can claim core team member status. Further exploration of this interesting context of interprofessional practice is warranted.","This paper explores the role and perceived value of chiropractors within interprofessional health care teams in Danish elite football clubs. Through qualitative interviews, it identifies themes related to the benefits and challenges of chiropractic care, highlighting the importance of chiropractors as musculoskeletal health care providers while questioning their status as core team members."
The Relationship Between Neurocognitive Function and Biomechanics: A Critically Appraised Topic,2020-08-13,,,,"Clinical Scenario: Neurocognitive performance may put individuals at a greater risk for lower-extremity musculoskeletal injuries.

Clinical Question: Is there a relationship between neurocognitive performance and lower-extremity biomechanics during a jumping or cutting task in healthy adult athletes? Summary of Key Findings: The literature was searched for articles that examined the relationship of a baseline neurocognitive test and a biomechanical analysis following a sports-related task. A total of 3 cross-sectional articles were included. All 3 studies concluded that poorer neurocognitive performance was associated with biomechanical faults that are linked to increased risk or rate of lower-extremity musculoskeletal injury. Clinical Bottom Line: Based on the evidence included, there is a moderate-level evidence to support the relationship between neurocognition and lower-extremity biomechanics in healthy adult athletes. Strength of Recommendation: In accordance with the van Tulder approach, there is a moderate level of evidence due to consistent findings from a combination of high- and limited-quality articles.","The paper investigates the relationship between neurocognitive function and lower-extremity biomechanics to understand the risk of musculoskeletal injuries in athletes. It concludes that poorer neurocognitive performance correlates with biomechanical faults, supporting the idea that neurocognition may influence injury risk, backed by moderate-level evidence from the literature."
Comparison of symptomatic spondylolysis in young soccer and baseball players,2020-08-07,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> <bold>Background: </bold>Spondylolysis is a main cause of low back pain (LBP) in young athletes. There are few studies analyzing the difference of spondylolysis among young athletes with different sports activity. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical factors and distribution of the lesions of spondylolysis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in young soccer and baseball players with symptomatic spondylolysis.<bold>Methods: </bold>The medical records of 267 young athletes aged 7 to 18 years old who underwent MRI to evaluate the cause of LBP between 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with spondylolysis. Of the young athletes with symptomatic spondylolysis, clinical factors and MRI findings in soccer and baseball players were retrospectively evaluated. The clinical factors were age, sex, interval from onset of LBP to MRI, and side of the dominant leg in the sports field. MRI findings included number, lumbar level, and side of the lesions. <bold>Results: </bold>A total of 33 soccer players (mean age, 15.4 ± 1.4 years) and 49 baseball players (mean age, 15.4 ± 1.6 years) with symptomatic spondylolysis were enrolled. All patients were male. No significant differences were noted in age and the interval from onset of LBP to MRI between the groups. Soccer players had greater numbers of multiple (p &lt; 0.001) and bilateral (p &lt; 0.001) lesions than baseball players. The dominant side of the hand for pitching or batting was correlated with the contralateral-side lesions in baseball players (p = 0.001).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The distribution of the lesions of spondylolysis differed in young soccer and baseball players. Pitching or batting with the dominant-side hand would be associated with contralateral-side lesions in baseball players. Sports-specific movements and the side of the dominant leg should be considered when treating young athletes with symptomatic spondylolysis.","This paper compares the clinical factors and MRI findings of symptomatic spondylolysis in young soccer and baseball players, examining differences in lesion distribution. The study finds that soccer players have more multiple and bilateral lesions compared to baseball players, with a particular correlation between the dominant-hand use and contralateral lesions in baseball players."
Effects of Hoverboard on Balance in Young Soccer Athletes,2020-08-06,,,,"Hoverboards are always more popular among children. Hoverboards are to them like a game or a mean of transport, but they could be used as a valid and useful instrument in children’s training programs to improve their performance. In this study, we compared the athletic performance of two groups of 12 children. A total of 24 children aged between 8 and 11 years followed a similar training program for five months, but the first group used a hoverboard (Hb+ group: Age: Standard Deviation (SD) = 1.15 Mean = 9.66; Weight: SD = 5.90 Mean = 32; Height: SD = 7.64 Mean = 135.08) for some of the training time, differently from the second group (Hb- group: Age: SD = 1.15 Mean = 9.66; Weight: SD = 5.82 Mean = 31.16; Height: SD = 7.66 Mean = 136.16), which never used it. All of the children were asked to complete three tests (one leg test, stork test and balance beam walking test) before starting their own training program and after five months, to evaluate how their performances changed in terms of time. Comparing the recorded time difference between T0 and T1 of the Hb+ group with the same difference measured in Hb- group, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference (p value &lt; 0.05) between these data for all three tests. Children who used the hoverboard in their training program achieved better result than children who did not use it. In the future, the hoverboard could help athletes to improve their performances, possibly applying it not only in football training, but even in other sports.","This paper investigates the impact of hoverboard usage on balance performance in young soccer athletes, comparing two groups of children over a five-month training program. The results indicate that the group utilizing hoverboards demonstrated statistically significant improvements in balance tests, suggesting the potential of hoverboards as a beneficial training tool in soccer and other sports."

Countermovement Jump Assessment for Monitoring Prolonged Fatigue in Collegiate Female Soccer Players,2020-08-01,,,,"<bold>Introduction: </bold>Females are 4 to 6 times more likely to sustain an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury than their male counterparts during running and cutting sports, such as soccer. This sex disparity is thought to result from altered lower limb neuromuscular control that females present when fatigued at the end of practice or games. Yet, current fatigue monitoring techniques typically vary in their reliability, applicability and efficiency. <bold>Purpose: </bold>The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of the countermovement jump (CMJ) to quickly and reliably monitor fatigue in female soccer athletes. <bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-two (age: 19.3 ± 1.1 yrs, ht: 1.7 ± 7.2 m, and wt: 61.9 ± 7.7 kg) females from an NCAA Division I soccer team had peak isokinetic strength and power and specific ground reaction metrics of a CMJ including: peak and rate of force/power development, impulse, and reactive strength index modified, quantified immediately before off-season training, and immediately prior to- and following the completion of the competitive season. <bold>Results:</bold> Quadriceps and hamstrings peak torque and average power increased following the competitive season for both limbs compared to pre-season and pre-training time points (all: p &lt; 0.05). During the CMJ, maximum rate of power production and peak force were greater at the post-season compared to pre-training (p = 0.023 and p = 0.007, respectively) and pre-season (p = 0.024 and p = 0.044, respectively) time points, while peak power was greater at post-season compared to the pre-training (p = 0.018) time point. Changes in relative net impulse, peak power, peak landing force, and jump height during the CMJ demonstrated moderate to strong relations to changes in isokinetic variables from pre-training to post-season (all: p &lt; 0.05, r &gt; 0.4). Lastly, the same CMJ measures accurately identified 96% of starters (Eigenvalue = 2.147, p = 0.038) and 86% of first-year athletes, although the classification of first-year athletes was not statistically different than non-first-year athletes (Eigenvalue = 1.279, p = 0.173). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The current research identifies the CMJ task as a promising tool for athletic trainers and sports performance coaches to reliably monitor female soccer performance in general, and training loads specifically. Immediately following the competitive season, the current athletes increased isokinetic strength and power as well as CMJ performance, with changes in CMJ performance exhibiting a significant relation to changes in isokinetic strength and power. Yet, following off-season training, where isokinetic strength and power declined, albeit insignificantly, a similar relation between changes in CMJ performance and isokinetic strength and power was not observed. The experimental outcomes may indicate that the CMJ task is better suited for identifying increases in strength and power rather than decrements and fatigue. These same CMJ measures may serve as an effective tool for identifying improved strength and power, and performance differences for specific members of a collegiate soccer team, as 96% of starters and 86% of first-year athletes were accurately identified.","The paper investigates the use of the countermovement jump (CMJ) as a reliable method for monitoring fatigue and performance in collegiate female soccer players. The findings indicate that CMJ metrics correlate well with improvements in isokinetic strength and power after the competitive season, suggesting its effectiveness in tracking strength gains, although it may not be as suitable for detecting declines in performance or fatigue."
"Structure, intensity and player duels in under-13 football training in Switzerland",2020-07-31,,,,"We evaluated the structure (i.e., the different training parts), contents (i.e., the various activities used), intensity and occurrence of contact situations and headers during training sessions in under-13 football in Switzerland. 242 players from 20 different teams on average aged 11.4 (SD 0.7) years participated. The participants were filmed during a typical training session while they were equipped with a heart rate sensor. The sessions were systematically recorded to allow for detailed analyses. Furthermore, a preliminary and explorative analysis of the influence of the level of play on these results was conducted. The overall findings indicated that training included 33.4% playing forms, 29.5% training forms, 28.4% inactivity time and 8.7% athletics. The highest heart rates were achieved in the playing forms (166 min-1, 83% HRmax) compared to the other two activities (training forms 154 min-1, 77% HRmax; athletics 150 min-1, 75% HRmax). Each player had 12.8 duels and 0.6 headers per training. Overall most duels were conducted from anterior direction. Playing forms induce higher cardio-circulatory load as well as a better learning environment. Potentially dangerous situations like contact with other players or headers occurred in a single player on average every 6 minutes during a training session.","The paper evaluates the training structure, intensity, and occurrence of contact situations in under-13 football training sessions in Switzerland, involving 242 players. Findings suggest that playing forms lead to higher heart rates and better learning environments, while instances of duels and headers highlight potential injury risks during practice."
Impact of Quadriceps/Hamstrings Torque Ratio on Three-Dimensional Pelvic Posture and Clinical Pubic Symphysis Pain-Preliminary Results in Healthy Young Male Athletes,2020-07-29,,,,"Pain in the pubic symphysis is of significance, especially in high-performance sports. Pelvic torsion, possibly caused by muscular imbalances, is discussed as a pathogenic mechanism. This study examined a possible interrelationship between the maximum torques of quadriceps femoris and hamstrings and the spatial positioning of the hemi-pelvises, as well as the tenderness to palpation of the pubic symphysis. The three-dimensional pelvic contour of 26 pain free adolescents (age 16.0 ± 0.8 years, weight 66.3 ± 9.9 kg, height 176.2 ± 6.0 cm) was registered by means of an 3D optical system and the torsion of both hemi-pelvises against each other was calculated based on a simplified geometrical model. Tenderness on palpation of the pubic symphysis was assessed by means of a visual analogue scale, and isometric torques of knee extensors and flexors were measured for both legs. The torque ratio between knee extensors and flexors was calculated for both sides, as was the crossed torque ratio between the two legs. On the basis of a MANOVA, possible significant differences in torques and torque ratios between subgroups with lower and higher pelvic torsion were analyzed. The crossed torque ratio (F = 19.55, p &lt; 0.001, partial η2 = 0.453) and the tenderness to palpation of the pubic symphysis (F = 10.72, p = 0.003, partial η2 = 0.309) were significantly higher in the subgroup with higher pelvic torsion. The results indicate the crossed torque ratio of knee flexors and extensors as a potential biomechanical-pathogenic mechanism to be considered in the primary prevention and diagnosis of symphyseal pain.","This paper investigates the relationship between the quadriceps/hamstrings torque ratio and pelvic posture in young male athletes, particularly focusing on the potential impact on clinical pubic symphysis pain. The findings suggest that increased pelvic torsion correlates with a higher crossed torque ratio and tenderness at the pubic symphysis, highlighting the importance of biomechanical imbalances in the assessment and prevention of related pain."
"THE EFFECT OF COLD WATER IMMERSION ON PAIN, MUSCLE RECRUITMENT AND POSTURAL CONTROL IN ATHLETES",2020-07-29,,,,"ABSTRACT Introduction Numerous recovery strategies have been used to minimize performance loss related to delayed onset muscle soreness in athletes, and are part of prevention programs and training of most high-level sports. Objective To analyze the effects of cold-water immersion on delayed-onset muscle soreness, muscle recruitment, and postural control in soccer players. Objective The maximum load of the quadriceps femoris muscle strength was determined. After three days, the pain scale was used to measure the subject’s pain intensity. The recruitment of the quadriceps muscle was determined at the moment of the kick, and was associated with postural control. Methods Randomized, blinded clinical trial study. Two repeated series of maximum load sets at 60% MVC, performed in a knee extension chair, were used to induce quadriceps fatigue in the athletes. Participants Twenty-eight soccer players were allocated to four intervention groups: cold water immersion (CWIG, n = 7), thermoneutral water immersion (TWIG, n = 7), active recovery (ARG, n = 7), and rest (RG, n = 7), with each intervention being carried out for ten minutes. Revaluations were carried out after 24, 48, and 72 hours of the fatigue protocol. Results Pain intensity in the CWIG returned to baseline after 72 hours, while the TWIG, ARG, and RG continued to feel greater pain. For the other outcomes, no differences were found between the groups. Conclusion With regard to muscle recruitment and postural control at the time of the kick, no significant differences were found for the time periods or intervention established. Level of evidence I; High-quality randomized clinical trial with or without statistically significant difference, but with narrow confidence intervals.","The paper investigates the impact of cold-water immersion on delayed-onset muscle soreness, muscle recruitment, and postural control in soccer players. Key findings indicate that while cold-water immersion effectively returned pain levels to baseline after 72 hours, no significant differences in muscle recruitment or postural control were observed across different recovery interventions."
Performance Analysis in Sport,2020-07-28,,,,"Performance analysis (PA) in elite sport has become an increasingly important component of the coaching process. However, issues remain with existing approaches to PA, including limitations in the methods, an unclear conceptual base for PA, a gap between research and coaching practice, the reluctance of coaches to adopt novel methods, and guidance on how PA can move forward. This chapter briefly discusses limitations of the current PA methods in football and then introduces and demonstrates novel methods from Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) that can be used to investigate and potentially resolve some of these problems. Given that team sports, and specifically football are characteristic of a complex system, in this chapter we propose that methods used in HFE could enhance football PA, and subsequently the coaching process and ultimately performance. To demonstrate the utility of these methods, the current chapter describes how Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), Social Network Analysis (SNA), the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST), and the Critical Decision Method (CDM), can be used for PA in football and sport in general.","This paper discusses the limitations of current performance analysis (PA) methods in elite football and explores the integration of novel techniques from Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) to enhance PA and coaching practices. It introduces specific methods such as Cognitive Work Analysis, Social Network Analysis, Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork, and the Critical Decision Method as viable approaches to improve performance outcomes in team sports."
Lower Extremity Biomechanical Differences Between Female Dancers and Soccer Players,2020-07-28,,,,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in female athletes is common. Team sport athletes experience more ACL injuries than ballet and modern dancers. Examining biomechanical differences between these two groups may help to explain the discrepancy in ACL injury rates. The purpose of this study was to examine lower extremity kinematic differences between collegiate dancers and National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I soccer athletes during a rebound jump-landing task. Peak hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were collected during a jump-landing task. Results showed more knee flexion and less ankle eversion in the dancers compared to the soccer athletes. Differences in training and strategies used during landing may explain the kinematic differences between groups.","This paper investigates the lower extremity biomechanical differences between female dancers and soccer players, particularly during a rebound jump-landing task. The study highlights that dancers exhibit greater knee flexion and reduced ankle eversion compared to soccer athletes, suggesting that variations in training and landing strategies may influence these kinematic differences."
Is There a Relationship Between Workload and Occurrence of Back Pain and Back Injuries in Athletes?,2020-07-24,,,,"The back is subjected to a great deal of strain in many sports. Up to 20% of all sports injuries involve an injury to the lower back or neck. Repetitive or high impact loads (e.g., running, gymnastics, skiing) and weight loading (e.g., weightlifting) affect the lower back. Rotation of the torso (e.g., golf, tennis) causes damage to both, the lumbar and thoracic spine. The cervical spine is most commonly injured in contact sports (e.g., boxing, football). One of the factors that increases the odds of injuries in athletes is excessive and rapid increases in training loads. In spite of currently emerging evidence on this issue, little is known about the balance between physiological loading on the spine and athletic performance, versus overloading and back pain and/or injury in athletes. This scoping review aims (i) to map the literature that addresses the association between the training load and the occurrence of back pain and/or injury, especially between the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) and back problems in athletes of individual and team sports, and (ii) to identify gaps in existing literature and propose future research on this topic. A literature search of six electronic databases (i.e., MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, SportDiscus, and CINAHL) was conducted. A total of 48 research articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings identified that fatigue of the trunk muscles induced by excessive loading of the spine is one of the sources of back problems in athletes. In particular, high training volume and repetitive motions are responsible for the high prevalence rates. The most influential are biomechanical and physiological variations underlying the spine, though stress-related psychological factors should also be considered. However, limited evidence exists on the relationship between the ACWR and back pain or non-contact back injuries in athletes from individual and team sports. This may be due to insufficiently specified the acute and chronic time window that varies according to sport-specific schedule of competition and training. More research is therefore warranted to elucidate whether ACWR, among other factors, is able to identify workloads that could increase the risk of back problems in athletes.","This scoping review investigates the relationship between training workload and the incidence of back pain and injuries in athletes, emphasizing the need to understand the balance between physiological loading and overloading of the spine. It highlights the role of high training volumes and repetitive motions as contributors to back problems, while pointing out gaps in the literature regarding the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) and its influence on these issues."
Influence of Anticipation and Motor-Motor Task Performance on Cutting Biomechanics in Healthy Men,2020-07-20,,,,"Context Biomechanical analyses of cutting tasks have demonstrated kinematic differences associated with the noncontact knee-injury risk when the movement direction is unanticipated. Motor-motor dual tasks occur within dynamic environments and change the demand for attentional resources needed to complete athletic maneuvers, which may contribute to injury risk. Objective To investigate the influence of anticipation and motor-motor task performance on cutting biomechanics. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 32 healthy, recreationally active men (age = 23.1 ± 3.6 years, height = 180.0 ± 7.0 cm, mass = 81.3 ± 17.3 kg) who self-reported regular participation in cutting sports. Intervention(s) Participants performed a 45° side-step cut on the dominant limb in a random order of conditions: anticipation (anticipated, unanticipated) and task (no ball throw, ball fake, ball throw). Main Outcome Measure(s) Triplanar trunk, hip, and knee angles were assessed throughout the stance phase using 3-dimensional motion capture. Data were analyzed using a time series of means calculated from initial contact to toe-off (0%–100%) with 90% confidence intervals. Mean differences between conditions were identified as regions of nonoverlapping confidence intervals, and those that occurred during the region of peak vertical ground reaction force (0%–25%) are presented. Results Regardless of anticipation, attending to a ball (ball throw) resulted in more trunk extension (range = 2.9°–3.7°) and less lateral trunk flexion toward the cutting direction (range = 5.2°–5.9°). Planning to attend to a ball (ball fake) resulted in less lateral trunk flexion toward the cutting direction (4.7°). During unanticipated cutting, more trunk rotation away from the cutting direction was observed when attending to a ball (range = 5.3°–7.1°). The interaction of anticipation and task had a similar influence on sagittal- and frontal-plane trunk position. Conclusions Motor-motor task performance and its interaction with anticipation induced an upright, neutral trunk position during side-step cutting, which has been associated with the risk for noncontact knee injury. Promoting task complexity during rehabilitation and injury-prevention programs may better prepare individuals to succeed when performing high-risk athletic maneuvers.","This paper investigates how anticipation and motor-motor task performance influence the biomechanics of cutting movements in healthy men, particularly in the context of noncontact knee injury risk. The study finds that attending to a ball alters trunk positioning during cutting tasks, suggesting that incorporating task complexity could enhance rehabilitation and injury-prevention strategies in sports."
Landing Evaluation in Soccer Players with or without Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2020-07-20,,,,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate landing biomechanics in soccer players following ACLR during two landing tasks. Eighteen soccer players with an ACLR and 18 sex-matched healthy control soccer players participated in the study. Planned landing included jumping forward and landing on the force-plates, whereas unplanned landing included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force-plates. A significant landing×group interaction was found only for knee flexion angles (p=0.002). Follow-up comparisons showed that the ACL group landed with greater knee flexion during planned landing compared with unplanned landing (p&lt;0.001). Significant main effects of landing were found. The unplanned landing showed reduction in hip flexion (p&lt;0.001), hip extension moments (p&lt;0.013), knee extension moments (p&lt;0.001), and peak pressure (p&lt;0.001). A significant main effect for group for gastrocnemius muscle was found showing that the ACL group landed with reduced gastrocnemius activity (p=0.002). Unplanned landing showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with planned landing. The ACL group showed nearly similar landing biomechanics to the control group during both landing tasks. However, the ACL group used a protective landing strategy by reducing gastrocnemius activity.","This paper evaluates the landing biomechanics of soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) during planned and unplanned landing tasks. Key findings indicate that while the ACL group demonstrated greater knee flexion during planned landings and reduced gastrocnemius activity, they exhibited similar landing mechanics to healthy controls, though unplanned landings presented greater injury risks."
Repetitive Head Trauma Induces Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy by Multiple Mechanisms,2020-07-16,,,,"Abstract Exposure to repetitive neurotrauma increases lifetime risk for developing progressive cognitive deficits, neurobehavioral abnormalities, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a tau protein neurodegenerative disease first identified in boxers and recently described in athletes participating in other contact sports (notably American football, ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling) and in military veterans with blast exposure. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed by neuropathological examination of the brain after death. The defining diagnostic lesion of CTE consists of patchy perivascular accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that localize in the sulcal depths of the cerebral cortex. Neuronal abnormalities, axonopathy, neurovascular dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are triggered by repetitive head impacts (RHIs) and likely act as catalysts for CTE pathogenesis and progression. However, the specific mechanisms that link RHI to CTE are unknown. This review will explore two important areas of CTE pathobiology. First, we will review what is known about the biomechanical properties of RHI that initiate CTE-related pathologies. Second, we will provide an overview of key features of CTE neuropathology and how these contribute to abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation, accumulation, and spread.","This paper reviews the mechanisms by which repetitive head trauma contributes to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease associated with contact sports and military exposure. Key themes include the biomechanical properties of repetitive head impacts and the resulting pathobiological changes, particularly relating to tau protein accumulation and neuroinflammation."
Performance changes during the off-season period in football players – Effects of age and previous hamstring injury,2020-07-13,,,,"The aims of this study were to investigate changes in selected performance measures during an off-season period, their association, and the potential role of age and previous hamstring injury in semi-professional and amateur football players. Seventy-four male players (age: 25 ± 4 years, stature: 178.0 ± 6.6 cm, body mass: 74.9 ± 8.1 kg) were assessed at the beginning and end of the off-season summer-period for sprint, change-of-direction performance and eccentric hamstring strength. Small to medium increases in sprint times were observed at 5 (d = 0.26, p = 0.057), 10 (d = 0.42, p < 0.001) and 30 m (d = 0.64, p < 0.001). Small (d = -0.23, p = 0.033) improvements were observed for COD performance, and no changes in eccentric hamstring strength (d = 0.10, p = 0.317). The changes in the outcomes were not affected by age (p = 0.449 to 0.928) or previous hamstring injury (p = 0.109 to 0.995). The impaired sprint performance was not related to changes in eccentric hamstring strength (r = -0.21 to 0.03, p = 0.213 to 0.856), instead, changes in COD performance were associated with changes in eccentric hamstring strength (r = -0.42, p = 0.008).","This study examines performance changes in sprint, change-of-direction (COD) ability, and eccentric hamstring strength in semi-professional and amateur football players during the off-season, considering factors like age and previous hamstring injuries. The results indicate small to medium improvements in sprint times and COD performance, with no significant influence from age or previous injuries, and a relationship between changes in COD performance and eccentric hamstring strength."
Jumping Side Volley in Soccer—A Biomechanical Preliminary Study on the Flying Kick and Its Coaching Know-How for Practitioners,2020-07-12,,,,"The jumping side volley has created breathtaking moments and cherished memories for soccer fans. Regrettably, scientific studies on the skill cannot be found in the literature. Relying on the talent of athletes to improvise on the fly can hardly be considered a viable learning method. This study targeted to fill this gap by quantifying the factors of the jumping side volley and to contribute to the development of a coaching method for it. Using 3D motion capture (12 cameras, 200 Hz) and full-body biomechanical modeling, our study aimed to identify elements that govern the entrainment of skill execution. Given the rarity of players who have acquired this skill and the low success rate of the kick (even in professional games), we were able to achieve and review 23 successful trials from five college-level subjects and quantify them for the study. The results unveiled the following key elements: (1) the control of trunk rotation during jumping, (2) the angle between thighs upon take-off, (3) the whip-like control of the kicking leg while airborne, (4) timing between ball motion and limb coordination, and (5) damping mechanism during falling. An accurate kick can normally be achieved through repetitive training. This underlines the need for athletes to master a safe landing technique that minimizes risk of injury during practice. Therefore, training should begin with learning a safe falling technique.","This paper investigates the biomechanics of the jumping side volley in soccer, aiming to bridge the gap in scientific literature regarding this skilled technique. Key findings highlight crucial elements such as trunk rotation, take-off angle, limb coordination, and safe landing techniques, ultimately contributing to improved coaching methods for practitioners."
The effect of pre-season football training on hematological parameters of well-trained young male football players,2020-07-05,,,,"Background and Study Aim. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of metabolic stress created by 6-week football training applied in the pre-season period on circulation and hematological parameters of well-trained male football players.&#x0D; Material and Methods. Fourteen male football players who competed in the U19 category of a football team in Turkish Football Super League participated in the study voluntarily. In the study, players’ systolic - diastolic blood pressures and resting heart rates were measured and their blood samples were taken before and after the 6-week training period. Laboratory analysis was made to determine counts and concentration percentage of erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet sub-parameters. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was performed to determine the difference between pre and post measurements.&#x0D; Results. Our findings indicated that baseline mean values of lymphocyte, mean cell hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were significantly higher than posttest mean values. The mean of diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate measured before the preseason training camp were lower than their posttest mean values (p &gt; .05).&#x0D; Conclusion. It is thought that the decrease in the mean values of diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate caused by the effect of regular training during the preseason training period, while the increase in the mean values of mean cell haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration caused by the increased oxygen demand of the metabolism during the training period.&#x0D;","The paper investigates the effects of a 6-week pre-season football training program on the hematological parameters of well-trained young male players.

Concussion in soccer: a comprehensive review of the literature,2020-07-01,,,,"Sports-related concussion has been examined extensively in collision sports such as football and hockey. However, historically, lower-risk contact sports such as soccer have only more recently garnered increased attention. Here, we review articles examining the epidemiology, injury mechanisms, sex differences, as well as the neurochemical, neurostructural and neurocognitive changes associated with soccer-related concussion. From 436 titles and abstracts, 121 full texts were reviewed with a total of 64 articles identified for inclusion. Concussion rates are higher during competitions and in female athletes with purposeful heading rarely resulting in concussion. Given a lack of high-level studies examining sports-related concussion in soccer, clinicians and scientists must focus research efforts on large-scale data gathering and development of improved technologies to better detect and understand concussion.","This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on sports-related concussion in soccer, highlighting its epidemiology, injury mechanisms, and neurocognitive impacts. It emphasizes the higher concussion rates in competitions and female athletes, while calling for more rigorous studies and improved technologies for detecting concussions in the sport."
Effect of Sex on Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury–Related Biomechanics During the Cutting Maneuver in Preadolescent Athletes,2020-07-01,,,,"There are 2 movement patterns associated with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury: dynamic valgus and stiff landing. Although sex-dependent differences have been identified for adults, less is known for preadolescent athletes regarding movement patterns known to load the ACL.We hypothesized that girls would demonstrate greater vertical ground reaction forces and knee valgus angles. We further hypothesized that the exercise intervention would affect girls more than boys and that this would primarily be demonstrated in less sagittal plane excursions, increased vertical ground reaction forces and knee valgus moments for girls than for boys.Controlled laboratory study.Male and female soccer and handball players (n = 288; age range, 9-12 years) were recruited. A motion capture system synchronized to a force platform was used to record 5 trials of a cutting maneuver before and after a 5-minute fatigue intervention. Linear mixed models were constructed, and analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in outcomes associated with the sex of the athletes.Boys showed greater peak knee valgus moment (0.26 vs 0.22 N·m/kg, respectively; P = .048), peak knee internal rotation moment (-0.13 vs -0.10 N·m/kg, respectively; P = .021), knee rotation excursion (-7.9° vs -6.9°, respectively; P = .014), and knee extension excursion (2.7° vs 1.4°, respectively; P < .001) compared with that in girls. A significant sex × fatigue intervention interaction (F = 7.6; P = .006) was found, which was caused by a greater increase in first peak vertical ground-reaction force (vGRF) from before to after the fatigue intervention for girls (15.3 to 16.0 N/kg) compared with boys (16.4 to 16.5 N/kg).Differences detected for biomechanical factors during the cutting maneuver do not point to a greater ACL injury risk for prepubescent or early pubescent girls than for boys. Nonetheless, girls go on to develop more detrimental movement patterns in adolescence than those in boys in terms of biomechanical risk factors.Early adolescence is a good target age to learn and develop muscular control; balance, strength; flexibility; and jumping, running, and landing control. This time of physical and athletic growth may therefore be an appropriate period to influence biomechanical factors and thereby task execution and the injury risk.","This study examines sex differences in biomechanical factors related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries during cutting maneuvers in preadolescent athletes. The findings indicate that boys exhibited greater knee valgus and internal rotation moments compared to girls, and while no greater risk of ACL injury was found for girls, their movement patterns could lead to increased risk in adolescence, highlighting the importance of targeted intervention during early adolescence to improve muscular control and mitigate injury risk."
Prevalence and Incidence of Microhemorrhages in Adolescent Football Players,2020-07-01,,,,"SWI is an advanced imaging modality that is especially useful in cerebral microhemorrhage detection. Such microhemorrhages have been identified in adult contact sport athletes, and the sequelae of these focal bleeds are thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. The purpose of this study was to utilize SWI to determine whether the prevalence and incidence of microhemorrhages in adolescent football players are significantly greater than those of adolescent noncontact athletes. Preseason and postseason SWI was performed and evaluated on 78 adolescent football players. SWI was also performed on 27 adolescent athletes who reported no contact sport history. Two separate one-tailed Fisher exact tests were performed to determine whether the prevalence and incidence of microhemorrhages in adolescent football players are greater than those of noncontact athlete controls. Microhemorrhages were observed in 12 football players. No microhemorrhages were observed in any controls. Adolescent football players demonstrated a significantly greater prevalence of microhemorrhages than adolescent noncontact controls (P = .02). Although 2 football players developed new microhemorrhages during the season, microhemorrhage incidence during 1 football season was not statistically greater in the football population than in noncontact control athletes (P = .55). Adolescent football players have a greater prevalence of microhemorrhages compared with adolescent athletes who have never engaged in contact sports. While microhemorrhage incidence during 1 season is not significantly greater in adolescent football players compared to adolescent controls, there is a temporal association between playing football and the appearance of new microhemorrhages.","This study investigates the prevalence and incidence of cerebral microhemorrhages in adolescent football players using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). The findings reveal that while adolescent football players show a significantly greater prevalence of microhemorrhages compared to noncontact athletes, the incidence during a single season is not significantly higher."
Comparing the Kinematics of the Lower Limb Joints in Jump-Landing Maneuver Among Soccer Players With and Without Histories of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2020-07-01,,,,"Background: Jumping and landing are common activities in soccer, i.e., associated with Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries in the players, especially when experiencing fatigue. The current study aimed to compare the kinematics of the lower limb joints in jump-landing maneuver among soccer players with and without a history of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: Among active soccer players in the provincial league level in Hamedan Province, Iran, 12 individuals with the intact knee (control group), and 12 individuals with 6 to 24 months post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (experimental group) were selected by convivence sampling method as the study participants. During the jump-landing task, the range of motion and the joints' angle at the contact instance were measured before and after performing plyometric fatigue protocol using the Vicon motion capture system. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) at a significance level of P&lt;0.05 was used for intergroup comparisons. Results: Plyometric fatigue did not affect most of the kinematic variables before and after fatigue experience. Besides, only the hip range of motion revealed a significant difference between the study groups (P=0.38). Conclusion: Fatigue had more effect on some variables in individuals with ACL reconstruction, including the left and right hips angles. Moreover, there was a significant difference in some variables between the study groups; the range of motion of the left hip, the contact angle of the right hip before fatigue experience, and the contact angle of the right and left hips after fatigue. In general, a proper rehabilitation program is recommended for athletes with ACL reconstruction to reduce the risk of recurrence of jumping movements in exercise.","This paper investigates the kinematics of lower limb joints during jump-landing maneuvers in soccer players, comparing those with ACL reconstruction to those without. Key findings indicate that plyometric fatigue did not significantly impact most kinematic variables, although notable differences in hip angles were observed between the two groups, suggesting the need for tailored rehabilitation programs to mitigate injury risks."
The Use Of Micro-doppler Radar For Motion Analysis In NCAA Athletes,2020-07-01,,,,"PURPOSE: The current musculoskeletal portion of the pre-participation physical exam lacks evidence for the detection of biomechanical subtleties that predispose an athlete to injury. Previous pilot data has shown that micro-Doppler radar has the potential to provide objective data on limb and torso variations at a granular level using a handheld, portable and cost effective device. The purpose of this study was to determine if micro-Doppler radar signals can predictably and accurately detect subtle differences in human movement patterns. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study using micro-Doppler radar technology to detect known differences in biomechanics among Division III athletes. Each participant performed 3 sets of 3 squat jumps in front of the micro-Doppler radar antenna. Each set of squat jumps was performed barefoot, with shoes and with a 2cm heel lift at both 0 degrees and turned 90 degrees to the antenna. The micro-Doppler responses were processed using short-time Fourier transform, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to highlight differences among the data sets and to minimize background noise from the radar. Further computer learning classification using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and discriminant analysis classifier were used to determine the micro-Doppler radar accuracy for predicting movement patterns. RESULTS: Thirty seven NCAA Division 3 Football athletes aged 18-22 were recruited and consented to perform the protocol. All micro-Doppler radar responses were recorded and processed successfully. The overall accuracy of the computer-derived models to predict which participants were wearing shoes, a heel lift or barefoot was 83%-100% for all groups regardless of whether the athlete was facing or turned to the right of the radar. CONCLUSIONS: This study was able to demonstrate that micro-Doppler radar technology has excellent predictability and can accurately detect subtle differences in movement. Future studies will aim to further validate data sets using comparison studies to biomechanical video analysis techniques. Ultimately the goal will be to use the micro-Doppler radar to define movement patterns that may predispose athletes to injury allowing us to determine a high risk group to direct injury prevention resources.","This paper investigates the use of micro-Doppler radar technology for detecting subtle differences in movement patterns among NCAA Division III football athletes, with a focus on its potential to predict biomechanical variations that could indicate injury risk. The study's results show high accuracy in distinguishing different movement configurations (e.g., barefoot vs. shoes) based on radar signals, suggesting that this technology may enhance pre-participation assessments in sports."
Correlations Between Dual-task Costs In Clinic Versus Laboratory Movements,2020-07-01,,,,"Identifying increases in injury-relevant biomechanics when athletes are distracted by a secondary task may be important for assessing performance and injury risk in athletic environments. It is unknown if this dual task cost (DTC) measured during detailed motion capture testing is associated with DTC on simple clinical tests. Such a relationship may prove useful for improving clinically feasible return-to-play assessments. PURPOSE: Investigate whether dual-task ability spans clinical and laboratory methods of assessment. METHODS: Twenty-three female soccer players (21 ± 3yrs, 1.7 ± 0.1m, 64 ± 10kg) completed an agility drill requiring two 90° turns and one 180° turn. This was completed in isolation (baseline) and under three dual-task conditions: counting backwards by seven (S7), dribbling a soccer ball (BH), and combined ball dribbling and counting tasks (BHS7). Agility drill DTC (aDTC) was calculated as the percent change in completion time between dual-task and baseline conditions. A jump-land-jump task from a 30 cm box was also completed while 3D kinematics and kinetics were recorded. Dual task jump conditions included working memory (WM), working memory + visual attention task (WMV), and unanticipated working memory + visual attention task (UWMV) tasks. Biomechanical DTC (bDTC) was calculated as the percent change in peak knee valgus moment (pkVM) between dual-task jump landings and a single-task jump landing. Spearman’s rho correlations were run between all combinations of aDTC and bDTC (Figure 1).RESULTS: Increases in aDTC for the S7 condition were associated with increases in bDTC for the WMV (ρ=0.49, p=0.02) and the WM (ρ=0.43, p=0.04) conditions. No other relationships reached significance (i.e., p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Dual-task ability spanned clinical and laboratory assessments when the secondary task was an anticipated cognitive task. Further research is needed to establish the clinical utility of these relationships.","This paper investigates the correlation between dual-task costs (DTC) in both clinical and laboratory settings with a focus on female soccer players. The findings suggest that increases in agility drill DTC are associated with changes in biomechanical DTC during jump tasks, highlighting the potential for using dual-task assessments to improve return-to-play protocols based on cognitive distractions."
Neuromuscular Training Intervention Developed To Combat The Effects Of Acute Fatigue In Collegiate Pivoting Athletes,2020-07-01,,,,"PURPOSE: A large body of evidence has mounted supporting the efficacy of neuromuscular training (NMT) for prevention of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Incorporation of NMT with athletes has been shown to improve biomechanics during dynamic pivoting movements. However, there is a lack of literature to date examining the influence of NMT on biomechanical measures during dynamic movements in a state of acute fatigue. This study examined strength, dynamic balance, and lower quarter biomechanics while performing functional movements succeeding a short-term fatigue protocol in collegiate soccer athletes before and after an eight-week NMT intervention. METHODS: 28 Division II NCAA male and female soccer players ages 18-23 participated in the study. Hip strength was measured with hand dynamometry and single-leg stance modified balance (SLSM) was measured with eyes shut and in static heel rise. The Noraxon MyoMotion system assessed peak hip and knee excursion in three dimensions during select movement assessments following execution of the functional agility short-term fatigue protocol. Training consisted of 16 NMT sessions, performed over eight weeks, following which the tests were repeated. RESULTS: Improvements post-intervention were found in hip abduction strength L (p=0.015), hip extension strength R (p=0.031) and L (p=0.013); SLSM with eyes-closed on R (p=0.000) and L (p=0.000); SLSM with heel rise bilaterally (p=0.000); peak ROM for L hip abduction (p=.025), R knee flexion (p=0.002), and L knee flexion (p=0.006) during single-leg squat; peak ROM for R hip flexion (p=0.033) during bilateral squat; peak ROM for L hip flexion (p=0.045) and L knee flexion (p=0.000) during single-leg jump assessment and peak ROM for R knee flexion (p=0.029) and L knee flexion (p=0.045) during bilateral jump. CONCLUSIONS: Following the NMT intervention, proximal hip strength, dynamic balance, and functional loading capacity significantly improved, illustrating positive neuromuscular adaptations in the lower quarter and nervous system. Enhanced kinematics during select sport-specific movement assessments were evident by the MyoMyotion system following a fatigue protocol, defending the hypothesis that NMT can improve lower extremity biomechanics of collegiate pivoting athletes while acutely fatigued.","This study investigates the impact of a neuromuscular training (NMT) intervention on lower quarter biomechanics in collegiate soccer athletes after acute fatigue. The eight-week program resulted in significant improvements in hip strength, dynamic balance, and functional kinematics during fatigue-induced conditions, supporting the effectiveness of NMT in enhancing athletic performance and injury prevention."
Frontal Plane Knee Biomechanics And Functional Movement Screen Scores Of Previously Injured DIII Football Players,2020-07-01,,,,"Football has the highest rate of knee injuries when compared to other contact sports (Rothenberg, 2016). It is important to investigate whether the risk for such injuries in NCAA Division III football players can be assessed by the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and frontal plane knee alignment during a single leg squat (SLS), as suggested by Kiesel et al (2007) and Ugalde (2015), respectively. PURPOSE: To compare FMS deep squat (DS) and active straight leg raise (ASLR) scores and to determine the relationship between frontal plane knee biomechanics in the SLS and ASLR and DS scores in healthy NCAA Division III football players and athletes with previous knee injuries. METHODS: Fourteen football players (mean age = 21.4) were recruited and consented to participate in this study. They completed the FMS and were rated by a certified level 1 FMS tester, then changed into black compression clothing. Markers were placed on the tibial tuberosity and distal tibia to define absolute valgus and varus angles at the deepest point of the SLS, where the supporting heel was still in contact with the ground. Trials were recorded using a digital camera facing the frontal plane and angles were measured using Dartfish Software. RESULTS: For the previously injured group (n=7), mean right SLS angle was 0.5° (valgus) and mean left SLS angle was 0.38° (varus), mean DS was 1.86, mean ASLR was 2.43, and mean composite score was 14.14. DS was negatively correlated with right (r = -0.13) and left (r=-0.12) SLS angles, right ASLR was negatively associated with right SLS (r = -0.12), left ASLR was negatively correlated to left SLS (r=-0.13). For the non-injured group (n=7), right SLS mean angle was 3.55° (valgus) and left mean SLS was 2.27° (valgus), mean DS was 2, mean ASLR was 2.43, and mean composite score was 15. DS was positively correlated with right (r = 0.59) and left (r= 0.86) SLS angles, right ASLR was negatively associated with right SLS (r = -0.13), left ASLR was negatively correlated to left SLS (r=-0.66). There was no significant difference in SLS angles, DS, or ASLR scores between groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Knee angles in the SLS, DS, and ASLR scores did not differ between groups. For the healthy group, DS had strong positive relationships with SLS angles and left ASLR had a moderate negative relationship to left SLS angles.","The paper investigates the relationship between Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores and frontal plane knee biomechanics during a single leg squat (SLS) in NCAA Division III football players, particularly comparing those with previous knee injuries to healthy counterparts. The results indicate no significant differences in knee angles or FMS scores between the two groups, although certain correlations were observed within the healthy group."
Faculty Opinions recommendation of Effects of soccer heading on brain structure and function.,2020-06-26,,,,"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, with more than 265 million players worldwide, including professional and amateur ones.Soccer is unique in comparison to other sports, as it is the only sport in which participants purposely use their head to hit the ball.Heading is considered as an offensive or defensive move whereby the player's unprotected head is used to deliberately impact the ball and direct it during play.A soccer player can be subjected to an average of 6-12 incidents of heading the ball per competitive game, where the ball reaches high velocities.Moreover, in practice sessions, heading training, which involves heading the ball repeatedly at low velocities, is common.Although the scientific community, as well as the media, has focused on the effects of concussions in contact sports, the role of subconcussive impacts, as it can occur during heading, has recently gained attention, considering that it may represent an additional mechanism of cumulative brain injury.The purpose of this study is to review the existing literature regarding the effects of soccer heading on brain structure and function.Only in the last years, some investigations have addressed the impact of heading on brain structure, by using neuroimaging techniques.Similarly, there have been some recent studies investigating biochemical markers of brain injury in soccer players.There is evidence of association between heading and abnormal brain structure, but the data are still preliminary.Also, some studies have suggested that subconcussive head impacts, as heading, could cause cognitive impairment, whereas others have not corroborated this finding.Questions persist as to whether or not heading is deleterious to cognitive functioning.Further studies, especially with longitudinal designs, are needed to clarify the clinical significance of heading as a cause of brain injury and to identify risk factors.Such investigations might contribute to the establishment of safety guidelines that could help to minimize the risk of possible adverse effects of soccer on brain structure and function.","This paper reviews existing literature on the effects of soccer heading on brain structure and function, highlighting the unique aspect of heading in soccer as a deliberate action that subjects players to recurrent head impacts. It identifies the potential risks associated with subconcussive impacts, discusses preliminary evidence linking heading to abnormal brain structure and cognitive impairment, and calls for further longitudinal studies to clarify the clinical significance and establish safety guidelines."

"Systematic video analysis of ACL injuries in professional male football (soccer): injury mechanisms, situational patterns and biomechanics study on 134 consecutive cases",2020-06-19,,,,"Background A few small studies have reported on the mechanisms of ACL injury in professional male football. Aim To describe the mechanisms, situational patterns and biomechanics (kinematics) of ACL injuries in professional male football matches. Methods We identified 148 consecutive ACL injuries across 10 seasons of professional Italian football. 134 (90%) injury videos were analysed for mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 107 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. ACL injury epidemiology (month), timing within the match and pitch location at the time of injury were also reported. Results 59 (44%) injuries were non-contact, 59 (44%) were indirect contact and 16 (12%) were direct contact. Players were frequently perturbed immediately prior to injury. We identified four main situational patterns for players who suffered a non-contact or an indirect contact injury: (1) pressing and tackling (n=55); (2) tackled (n=24); (3) regaining balance after kicking (n=19); and (4) landing from a jump (n=8). Knee valgus loading (n=83, 81%) was the dominant injury pattern across all four of these situational patterns (86%, 86%, 67% and 50%, respectively). 62% of the injuries occurred in the first half of the matches (p&lt;0.01). Injuries peaked at the beginning of the season (September–October) and were also higher at the end of the season (March–May). Conclusions 88% of ACL injuries occurred without direct knee contact, but indirect contact injuries were as frequent as non-contact injuries, underlying the importance of mechanical perturbation. The most common situational patterns were pressing, being tackled and kicking.","The paper systematically analyzes 134 ACL injuries in professional male football to identify their mechanisms, situational patterns, and related biomechanics. It highlights that a majority of injuries were non-contact or resulted from indirect contact, with knee valgus loading being a prevalent injury pattern, particularly during pressing and tackling situations."
Comparison of Symptomatic Spondylolysis in Young Soccer and Baseball Players,2020-06-18,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> <bold>Background: </bold>Spondylolysis is a main cause of low back pain (LBP) in young athletes. There are few studies analyzing the difference of spondylolysis among young athletes with different sports activity. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical factors and distribution of the lesions of spondylolysis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in young soccer and baseball players with symptomatic spondylolysis.<bold>Methods: </bold>The medical records of 178 young athletes aged 7 to 18 years old who underwent MRI to evaluate the cause of LBP between 2017 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with spondylolysis. Of the young athletes with symptomatic spondylolysis, clinical factors and MRI findings in soccer and baseball players were retrospectively evaluated. The clinical factors were age, sex, interval from onset of LBP to MRI, and side of the dominant leg in the sports field. MRI findings included number, lumbar level, and side of the lesions. <bold>Results: </bold>A total of 21 soccer players (mean age, 15.2 ± 1.4 years) and 38 baseball players (mean age, 15.1 ± 1.7 years) with symptomatic spondylolysis were enrolled. All patients were male. No significant differences were noted in age and the interval from onset of LBP to MRI between the groups. Soccer players had greater numbers of multiple (p = 0.005) and bilateral (p = 0.004) lesions than baseball players. The dominant side of the hand for pitching or batting was correlated with the contralateral-side lesions in baseball players (p = 0.01).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The distribution of the lesions of spondylolysis differed in young soccer and baseball players. Pitching or batting with the dominant-side hand would be associated with contralateral-side lesions in baseball players. Sports-specific movements and the side of the dominant leg should be considered when treating young athletes with symptomatic spondylolysis.","This paper investigates the differences in clinical factors and MRI findings of symptomatic spondylolysis between young soccer and baseball players. The study reveals that soccer players tend to have more multiple and bilateral lesions than baseball players, and highlights the correlation between pitching or batting with the dominant hand and contralateral-side lesions in baseball players."

A Penetrometer for Quantifying the Surface Stiffness of Sport Sand Surfaces,2020-06-15,,,,"Sand sports include running, volleyball, soccer, beach flags, ironman, and fitness training. An increased amount of soft tissue injuries have been widely reported. A novel technique of determining the surface stiffness of beach sand in-situ used a simple drop-test penetrometer. The relationship between drop height and the depth of penetration squared was linear (Pearson's correlation coefficient r2 > 0.92). The stiffness ratio between the soft dry sand and ocean-saturated wet sand compacted by eight hours of coastal water exposure was approximately seven, which was similar to previously reported stiffness measurements in a sand box. However, the absolute stiffness values were much smaller. While this technique was manually operated, an automatic system is postulated for future studies.","This paper presents a novel penetrometer designed to quantify the surface stiffness of beach sand used in various sand sports, highlighting the increased incidence of soft tissue injuries in these activities. The study establishes a linear correlation between drop height and penetration depth, comparing stiffness ratios of dry and wet sand, and suggests the potential for an automatic system for future research."
"Comparison of Biomechanical Factors among Straight, Curve and Knuckle Kicking Motions in Soccer",2020-06-15,,,,"The rotation of a soccer ball is affected by several factors, such as impact point and foot posture, which are generated by joint torque in the lower limb. This study aimed to investigate joint torque in the lower limb that generates foot posture and swing trajectory, and compare three types of kicks before and after a practice period for participants to learn to control the ball rotation. An optical three-dimensional motion capture system was used to record the kicking motion of the participants. The results indicate that the adduction torque of the hip joint at the moment of impact decreased for curve kicks (from 0.56 to 0.25 Nm/kg) and increased for knuckle kicks (from −0.09 to 0.37 Nm/kg). We considered that the curve and knuckle kicks swing towards the inside (because of their positive values in the post experiment) with hip joint adduction before impact to control ball rotation.","This paper investigates the effects of joint torque in the lower limb on foot posture and swing trajectory during three kicking styles in soccer: straight, curve, and knuckle kicks. The findings reveal changes in hip joint adduction torque at the moment of impact, highlighting the mechanical differences in kicking techniques and their implications for controlling ball rotation."
"Shoe-Integrated, Force Sensor Design for Continuous Body Weight Monitoring",2020-06-12,,,,"Traditional pedobarography methods use direct force sensor placement in the shoe insole to record pressure patterns. One problem with such methods is that they tap only a few points on the flat sole under the foot and, therefore, do not account for the total ground reaction force. As a result, body weight tends to be under-estimated. This disadvantage has made it more difficult for pedobarography to be used to monitor many diseases, especially when their symptoms include body weight changes. In this paper, the problem of pedobarographic body weight measurement is addressed using a novel ergonomic shoe-integrated sensor array architecture based on concentrating the applied force via three-layered structures that we call Sandwiched Sensor Force Consolidators (SSFC). A shoe prototype is designed with the proposed sensors and shown to accurately measure body weight with an achievable relative accuracy greater than 99%, even in the presence of motion. The achieved relative accuracy is at least 4X better than the existing state of the art. The SSFC shoe prototype is built using readily available soccer shoes and piezoresistive FlexiForce sensors. To improve the wearability and comfort of the instrumented shoe, a semi-computational sensor design methodology is developed based on an equivalent-area concept that can accurately account for SSFC’s with arbitrary shapes. The search space of the optimal SSFC design is shown to be combinatorial, and a high-performance computing (HPC) framework based on OpenMP parallel programming is proposed to accelerate the design optimization process. An optimal sensor design speedup of up to 22X is shown to be achievable using the HPC implementation.","This paper presents a novel shoe-integrated force sensor design aimed at improving body weight monitoring through a unique sensor array architecture called Sandwiched Sensor Force Consolidators (SSFC). The proposed system demonstrates a high relative accuracy in weight measurement, surpassing existing methods, and incorporates a computational design methodology to enhance sensor wearability and optimize performance."
The medial ligaments and the ACL restrain anteromedial laxity of the knee,2020-06-05,,,,"Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of each of the ACL and medial ligament structures in resisting anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI) loads applied in vitro. Methods Twelve knees were tested using a robotic system. It imposed loads simulating clinical laxity tests at 0° to 90° flexion: ±90 N anterior–posterior force, ±8 Nm varus–valgus moment, and ±5 Nm internal–external rotation, and the tibial displacements were measured in the intact knee. The ACL and individual medial structures—retinaculum, superficial and deep medial collateral ligament (sMCL and dMCL), and posteromedial capsule with oblique ligament (POL + PMC)—were sectioned sequentially. The tibial displacements were reapplied after each cut and the reduced loads required allowed the contribution of each structure to be calculated. Results For anterior translation, the ACL was the primary restraint, resisting 63–77% of the drawer force across 0° to 90°, the sMCL contributing 4–7%. For posterior translation, the POL + PMC contributed 10% of the restraint in extension; other structures were not significant. For valgus load, the sMCL was the primary restraint (40–54%) across 0° to 90°, the dMCL 12%, and POL + PMC 16% in extension. For external rotation, the dMCL resisted 23–13% across 0° to 90°, the sMCL 13–22%, and the ACL 6–9%. Conclusion The dMCL is the largest medial restraint to tibial external rotation in extension. Therefore, following a combined ACL + MCL injury, AMRI may persist if there is inadequate healing of both the sMCL and dMCL, and MCL deficiency increases the risk of ACL graft failure.","This study investigates the role of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial ligament structures in resisting anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI) of the knee through in vitro testing. The findings reveal that the ACL is the primary restraint against anterior translation, while the deep medial collateral ligament (dMCL) plays a significant role in resisting external rotation, underscoring the importance of both ligaments in knee stability and the potential implications for injury recovery."
DigiTech use in enhancing effective teaching of Health and Physical Education,2020-05-31,,,,"The 21st Century’s new dimension of digital technology usage in education has been unanimously welcomed worldwide. Higher education and tertiary institutions were awakened by the outbreak of the never experienced coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to embrace e-learning.

Quantitative Analysis of Biomechanical Parameters in CMJ and SJ Jump Tests on 10-14 Years Old Players of Tirana Futball Club,2020-05-28,,,,"Vertical jumping ability is of importance for good performance in different kinds of sports, and football among them.The most effective way for a football coach to improve vertical jumping ability is to enhance the maximal jump height (Hmax) and maximal force (Fmax) output in a training program, such as proprioception training.The purpose of this study is to estimate the quantitative analysis of biomechanical variables in counter movement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) tests.The participating subjects of this study were 29 boys aged 10-14 years old, players of Tirana Football Club (FC).According to the results of the t-test values, it was concluded that there was a statistical improvement of 7 cm in maximal height (CMJ test) and an improvement of 320 N in maximal force (SJ test).t-test analysis applied at this team, through the mean comparisons in three different phases of measuremets, emphasizes the differences between them and their statistical and practical significance.Two way ANOVA analysis within subjects showed a significant effect of training level, as a result of which it was concluded clearly that the jumping technique strongly affect the mechanical output muscles, as the motors that generate explosion maximal force and also maximal jump height.The proprioception exercises have a huge effect in the variety of training, by changing the style, monotony, the difficulty, which results in improving all biomechanical parameters including those of the sportive technique.","This paper investigates the impact of training interventions on vertical jump performance among youth football players, focusing on counter movement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) tests. Key findings include a significant improvement in maximal jump height and force output, emphasizing the effectiveness of proprioception training on biomechanical parameters and athletic performance."
An Inertial Measurement Unit Based Method to Estimate Hip and Knee Joint Kinematics in Team Sport Athletes on the Field,2020-05-26,,,,"Current athlete monitoring practice in team sports is mainly based on positional data measured by global positioning or local positioning systems. The disadvantage of these measurement systems is that they do not register lower extremity kinematics, which could be a useful measure for identifying injury-risk factors. Rapid development in sensor technology may overcome the limitations of the current measurement systems. With inertial measurement units (IMUs) securely fixed to body segments, sensor fusion algorithms and a biomechanical model, joint kinematics could be estimated. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate a sensor setup for estimating hip and knee joint kinematics of team sport athletes in the field. Five male subjects (age 22.5 ± 2.1 years; body mass 77.0 ± 3.8 kg; height 184.3 ± 5.2 cm; training experience 15.3 ± 4.8 years) performed a maximal 30-meter linear sprint. Hip and knee joint angles and angular velocities were obtained by five IMUs placed on the pelvis, both thighs and both shanks. Hip angles ranged from 195° (± 8°) extension to 100.5° (± 8°) flexion and knee angles ranged from 168.6° (± 12°) minimal flexion and 62.8° (± 12°) maximal flexion. Furthermore, hip angular velocity ranged between 802.6 °·s-1 (± 192 °·s-1) and -674.9 °·s-1 (± 130 °·s-1). Knee angular velocity ranged between 1155.9 °·s-1 (± 200 °·s-1) and -1208.2 °·s-1 (± 264 °·s-1).

Effects of maturation on knee biomechanics during cutting and landing in young female soccer players,2020-05-26,,,,"Young female soccer players are at high risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury due to the fast-paced nature of the sport and surplus of unplanned movements during play. Neuromuscular training programs that aim to reduce this injury by targeting the associated biomechanical movements are a potential solution. While previous studies have examined the lack of dynamic knee control during landing, there are few that outline the role that maturation can play during unanticipated cutting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if young female soccer players across multiple phases of maturation exhibited the before seen differences in knee control during a drop landing as well as an unanticipated cutting task. 139 female soccer players volunteered to participate in this study and were classified in three maturational groups based on percent adult stature: prepubertal (PRE), pubertal (PUB), and post-pubertal (POST). Each group performed a drop vertical jump (DVJ) and an unanticipated cutting task (CUT). Standard 3D motion capture techniques were used to determine peak knee flexion/abduction angles and moments during each task. Within tasks, POST exhibited significantly greater peak abduction angles and moments compared to PUB/PRE. While each maturational group exhibited greater peak knee abduction angles during the DVJ compared to the CUT, peak knee abduction moments during the CUT were greater compared to the DVJ. Participants within each maturational group exhibited greater knee flexion during the DVJ compared to the CUT, however there were no differences identified between groups. During both tasks, POST/PUB exhibited greater peak knee flexion moments compared to PRE, as well as POST compared to PUB. Overall, each group exhibited significantly greater peak knee flexion moments during the CUT compared to the DVJ. These observed differences indicate the need for neuromuscular training programs that target both jumping and cutting techniques to reduce ACL injuries.","This study examines the impact of maturation on knee biomechanics during cutting and landing tasks in young female soccer players, highlighting the increased risk of ACL injuries in this demographic. The findings demonstrate that maturation stages influence knee control, with post-pubertal players showing greater peak abduction angles and moments, emphasizing the necessity for targeted neuromuscular training programs to mitigate injury risks associated with these biomechanical movements."

Isokinetic back training is more effective than core stabilization training on pain intensity and sports performances in football players with chronic low back pain,2020-05-22,,,,"Abstract Background: Isokinetic training (IKT) and core stabilization training (CST) are commonly used for balance training in musculoskeletal conditions. The knowledge about the effective implementation of these training protocols on sports performances in university football players with chronic low back pain (LBP) is lacking. Objective: To find and compare the effects of IKT and CST on sports performances in university football players with chronic LBP. Design: Randomized, double-blinded controlled study. Setting: University hospital. Participants: Sixty LBP participants divided into isokinetic group (IKT; n = 20), core stabilization group (CST; n = 20), and the control group (n = 20) and received respected exercises for 4 weeks. Outcome measures: Clinical (pain intensity and player wellness) and sports performances (40 m sprint, 4 × 5 m sprint, submaximal shuttle running, counter movement jump, and squat jump) scores were measured at baseline, after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months. Results: Four weeks following training IKT group shows more significant changes in pain intensity and player wellness scores than CST and control groups ( P ≤ .001). Sports performance variables (40 m sprint, 4 × 5 m sprint, submaximal shuttle running, counter movement jump and squat jump) scores also show significant improvement in IKT group than the other 2 groups ( P ≤ .001). Conclusion: This study suggests that training through IKT improves pain intensity and sports performances than CST in university football players with chronic LBP.",The paper investigates the comparative effectiveness of isokinetic training (IKT) versus core stabilization training (CST) on pain intensity and sports performance in university football players with chronic low back pain.

The Professional Contribution of Chiropractors to Danish elite football clubs: A qualitative exploration of role and perceived value in an interprofessional service provision context.,2020-05-22,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> <bold>Background:</bold> Interprofessional team-based care has been widely adopted in elite level athletic health and performance practice. And although chiropractors can claim some penetration as health care service providers in high level sport, their position as valued members of interprofessional health care teams, especially those built around traditional medical organisational structures, is unclear. In Denmark, the mainstream provider status of chiropractors is more favourable than in most parts of the world. Moreover, chiropractors have been identified as service providers in the Danish premiere football league (Super Liga). However, little is currently known about the professional contribution made by chiropractors in this powerful sporting context.As a first step to map the professional practice landscape of Danish sports chiropractors, this investigation sought to explore the perceived role and perceived value of chiropractors as service providers in elite Danish football clubs. <bold>Methods:</bold> A comparative qualitative case study using semi-structured individual interviews was conducted. Six Danish Superliga clubs were purposively sampled to compare and contrast instances where chiropractors were absent from the health care team, contracted as in-house health care team members or engaged as external service providers. Triangulated responses were solicited from healthcare co-ordinators, chiropractors and athletes within each club’s organisation through short semi-structured individual interviews. The audio-recorded responses were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using a framework approach.<bold>Results:</bold> Inductive and deductive coding revealed 14 unique codes, which were further organised into 4 code families relating to the role of chiropractors, benefits of utilizing chiropractic care and facilitators and barriers to interprofessional practice. From this framework 3 themes were abstracted, these being: “Broadening horizons”, “In-house preferred to take-away” and “Already covered, or even necessary?”. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this practice context, chiropractors fill the role of musculoskeletal health care service providers. Their perceived value stems from additional expert disciplinary knowledge, improved diagnostic triage and increased treatment flexibility. However, where not utilized, the role of the spinal health expert is questioned and when acknowledged, limited to that of a technician/therapist. It is unclear whether chiropractors can claim core team member status. Further exploration of this interesting context of IPP practice is warranted.","This paper investigates the professional role and perceived value of chiropractors within Danish elite football clubs, focusing on their integration into interprofessional healthcare teams. Through qualitative interviews, it identifies key themes regarding the benefits and barriers of chiropractic care, highlighting their potential contributions to musculoskeletal health while exploring their ambiguous status within healthcare teams."
Traumatic Brain Injury among football players in 2017 Series A Brazilian Football Championship – The gap between concussion protocols and the current medical practices,2020-05-20,,,,"ABSTRACT Background Sideline assessment of football players with a potential concussion is a challenging concern. Video analysis is an important tool to recognize traumatic brain injury (TBI), including sports-related concussions, among football players. Aim To report the characteristics of TBI among football players in 2017 Brazilian Series A Football Championship and to discuss the evaluation protocols of football players with concussion. Methods This is an observational study concerning video analysis of all matches on 2017 Series A Brazilian Football Championship. The videos were first analyzed by a team of 10 trained medical students. All suspected TBIs were reviewed by the research’s coordinator. Concussion diagnosis was defined by one of the following events: lying motionless, loss of responsiveness, impact seizure, disorientation and motor incoordination. The length of sideline medical assessment was systematically recorded. Results In a whole of 380 matches, it was verified 374 TBIs. The most common etiology was “head-to-head” impact. Twelve players were replaced after TBI. Thirteen players (3,5% of TBIs) had concussion, but only four of them were replaced. The overall mean time for medical assessment was 1’35” (range: 48” to 7’40”). Considering the twelve players who had a concussion and the thirteen players who were replaced, the mean time for medical evaluation was 3’19” and 3’26”, respectively. Conclusion This study confirms that there is a gap between formal protocols for concussion assessment on sideline in Brazilian Elite Football and current medical practices. It also discusses changes on football rules of player replacement to an adequate sideline medical evaluation.","This paper examines the incidence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) among football players during the 2017 Brazilian Series A Football Championship, highlighting the challenges of sideline assessments and concussion protocols. The findings reveal a significant gap between established concussion protocols and actual medical practices, emphasizing the need for improved evaluation methods and potential changes to player replacement rules."
Assessment of Head Impacts and Muscle Activity in Soccer Using a T3 Inertial Sensor and a Portable Electromyography (EMG) System: A Preliminary Study,2020-05-19,,,,"Heading the ball is an important skill in soccer. Head impacts are of concern because of the potential adverse health effects. Many elite players now wear GPS (that include inertial monitoring units) on the upper spine for location tracking and workload measurement. By measuring the maximum acceleration of the head and the upper spine, we calculated the acceleration ratio as an attenuation index for participants (n = 8) of different skill levels during a front heading activity. This would allow for in-field estimates of head impacts to be made and concussive events detected. For novice participants, the ratio was as high as 8.3 (mean value 5.0 ± 1.8), whereas, for experienced players, the mean ratio was 3.2 ± 1.5. Elite players stiffen the neck muscles to increase the ball velocity and so the torso acts as a support structure. Electromyography (EMG) signals that were recorded from the neck and shoulder before and after a training intervention showed a major increase in mean average muscle activity (146%, p = 3.39 × 10−6). This was accompanied by a major decrease in acceleration ratio (34.41%, p = 0.008). The average head-ball impact velocity was 1.95 ± 0.53 m/s determined while using optical motion capture. For this low velocity, the impact force was 102 ± 19 N, 13% of the published concussive force. The voluntary action of neck muscles decreases isolated head movements during heading. Coaches and trainers may use this evidence in their development of junior players.","This study evaluates head impacts and muscle activity in soccer players using a T3 inertial sensor and portable electromyography system, focusing on the effects of ball heading across skill levels. Key findings include significant differences in acceleration ratios between novice and experienced players, increased neck muscle activity post-training, and insights for coaches to enhance junior player development while mitigating concussion risks."
"Mechanisms of Hamstring Strain Injury: Interactions between Fatigue, Muscle Activation and Function",2020-05-18,,,,"Isolated injury to the long head of biceps femoris is the most common type of acute hamstring strain injury (HSI). However, the precise hamstring injury mechanism (i.e., sprint-type) is still not well understood, and research is inconclusive as to which phase in the running cycle HSI risk is the greatest. Since detailed information relating to hamstring muscle function during sprint running cannot be obtained in vivo in humans, the findings of studies investigating HSI mechanisms are based on modeling that requires assumptions to be made based on extrapolations from anatomical and biomechanical investigations. As it is extremely difficult to account for all aspects of muscle-tendon tissues that influence function during high-intensity running actions, much of this complexity is not included in these models. Furthermore, the majority of analyses do not consider the influence of prior activity or muscular fatigue on kinematics, kinetics and muscle activation during sprinting. Yet, it has been shown that fatigue can lead to alterations in neuromuscular coordination patterns that could potentially increase injury risk. The present critical review will evaluate the current evidence on hamstring injury mechanism(s) during high-intensity running and discuss the interactions between fatigue and hamstring muscle activation and function.","This paper critically reviews the mechanisms behind hamstring strain injuries, particularly focusing on the long head of the biceps femoris during high-intensity sprinting. It highlights the need for a better understanding of how fatigue and muscle activation interplay with injury risk, given the limitations of existing biomechanical models that often overlook these critical factors."
Effect of Football Shoe Collar Type on Ankle Biomechanics and Dynamic Stability during Anterior and Lateral Single-Leg Jump Landings,2020-05-13,,,,"In this study, we investigated the effects of football shoes with different collar heights on ankle biomechanics and dynamic postural stability. Fifteen healthy college football players performed anterior and lateral single-leg jump landings when wearing high collar, elastic collar, or low collar football shoes. The kinematics of lower limbs and ground reaction forces were collected by simultaneously using a stereo-photogrammetric system with markers (Vicon) and a force plate (Kistler). During the anterior single-leg jump landing, a high collar shoe resulted in a significantly smaller ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), compared to both elastic (p = 0.031, dz = 0.511) and low collar (p = 0.043, dz = 0.446) types, while also presenting lower total ankle sagittal ROM, compared to the low collar type (p = 0.023, dz = 0.756). Ankle joint stiffness was significantly greater for the high collar, compared to the elastic collar (p = 0.003, dz = 0.629) and low collar (p = 0.030, dz = 1.040). Medial-lateral stability was significantly improved with the high collar, compared to the low collar (p = 0.001, dz = 1.232). During the lateral single-leg jump landing, ankle inversion ROM (p = 0.028, dz = 0.615) and total ankle frontal ROM (p = 0.019, dz = 0.873) were significantly smaller for the high collar, compared to the elastic collar. The high collar also resulted in a significantly smaller total ankle sagittal ROM, compared to the low collar (p = 0.001, dz = 0.634). Therefore, the high collar shoe should be effective in decreasing the amount of ROM and increasing the dynamic stability, leading to high ankle joint stiffness due to differences in design and material characteristics of the collar types.","This study examines the impact of different collar heights of football shoes on ankle biomechanics and dynamic stability during single-leg jump landings. The findings indicate that high collar shoes significantly reduce ankle range of motion and improve medial-lateral stability compared to low and elastic collar shoes, suggesting advantages in ankle joint stiffness and stability during athletic activities."
"A comparison of the balance skills, personality, and temperament traits between elite sports athletes and football players",2020-05-11,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> <bold>Background</bold>: Although research on balance skills and personality were explored in the field of sports science, little is known about the relationship between the two phenomena. This study aims to investigate the association of postural balance with traits of personality and temperament. The differences between elite athletes, football players, and the control sample will also be examined. <bold>Methods</bold>: Participants in the case-control study were 73 people, aged between 16 and 30 years old (M = 21.29, SD = 2.47), including 59% of men. Three samples of participants consisted of Elite Athletes (AE, n = 17, 23.29%) of the Polish National Team; Football Players (FP, n = 32, 43.84%); and Control Sample (CS, n = 24, 32.88%). Postural control was assessed on a force platform (Type 9286AA, Kistler Instrument AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The center of pressure (COP) parameters was measured during 20 seconds in both conditions eye open, and eye closed, in both directions anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML). The COP parameters include standard deviation (SD), mean range (RA), mean velocity (MV), and entropy (SE). The NEO-FFI questionnaire was used to assess Big-Five personality traits, whereas the FCB-TI was used to measure temperament traits. <bold>Results</bold>: One-way ANOVA revealed that the EA and CS groups were more stable in ML direction than the FP group. In the AP direction, the athletes from the EA group were more stable than the CS group. Nor personality, neither temperament did not differentiate the three groups of participants, beside agreeableness, which was significantly lower in both EA and FP groups. Openness to experiences is positively associated with COP parameters, as it was shown in regression analysis. All COP parameters can explain for about 40% of openness variability. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: The results of this study showed that EA and CS have better stability than footballers in both ML and AP direction. Openness seems to be related to postural balance skills.","This study investigates the relationship between postural balance, personality traits, and temperament in elite athletes, football players, and a control group. It finds that elite athletes and the control group exhibit better balance stability compared to football players, with openness to experience positively correlating with balance skills."
Systematic Reductions in Differential Ratings of Perceived Exertion Across a 2-Week Repeated-Sprint-Training Intervention That Improved Soccer Players’ High-Speed-Running Abilities,2020-05-06,,,,"Purpose : To quantify changes in differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) across a 2-wk repeated-sprint-training intervention that improved high-intensity intermittent-running ability and linear speed of semiprofessional soccer players. Methods : Thirteen players completed 3 (sessions 1–3) or 4 (sessions 4–6) sets of 7 sprints (group 1 [n = 7]: 30-m straight; group 2 [n = 6]: 2 × 10-m shuttle), with 20 s and 4 min of recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. Postset perceptions of breathlessness (RPE-B) and leg-muscle exertion (RPE-L) were rated using the CR100 scale. Results : Overall, RPE-B (mean [SD]: 46 [13] arbitrary units [AU], “hard”) was most likely higher than RPE-L (39 [13] AU, “somewhat hard,” mean difference: 8 AU; 90% confidence limits [CLs]: ±2). Set-to-set increases in dRPE (in AU; 90% CL: approximately ±2) were large in session 1 (RPE-B: 15; RPE-L: 14), moderate in sessions 2–5 (RPE-B: 7–10; RPE-L: 7–8), and small (RPE-B: 6) to moderate (RPE-L: 7) in session 6. Across the intervention, RPE-B reduced moderately in sets 3 (−13; 90% CL: ±4) and 4 (−12; 90% CL: ±12) and RPE-L reduced by a small magnitude in set 3 (−5; 90% CL: ±6). The set 4 change in RPE-L was unclear (−11; 90% CL: ±13). Conclusions : The authors observed systematic intrasession and intersession changes in dRPE across a 2-wk repeated-sprint-training intervention, with a fixed prescription of external load that improved semiprofessional soccer players’ high-speed-running abilities. These findings could support dRPE as a measure of internal load and highlight its usefulness in evaluating repeated-sprint-training dose–response.","The paper examines the impact of a 2-week repeated-sprint-training intervention on the differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) in semiprofessional soccer players, revealing systematic changes in perceived exertion associated with improved high-speed running abilities. Key findings indicate that while breathlessness ratings were generally higher than leg muscle exertion ratings, significant reductions in dRPE were found across the training sessions, demonstrating its potential as a measure of internal load in training evaluations."
Jumping Side Volley in Soccer &amp;ndash; A Biomechanical Preliminary Study on the Flying Kick and Its Coaching Know-How for Practitioners,2020-05-05,,,,"Jumping side volley has created breathtaking moments and cherished memories for us. Regrettably, a scientific study on the skill has not been found in literature. Relying on talent of athletes to improvise on the fly can hardly be considered a viable learning strategy. This study targets to fill the gap by quantifying factors contributing to develop its coaching method. Using 3D motion capture (12-cameras, 200Hz) and full-body biomechanical modeling, our study aimed to identify elements that govern entrainment of the skill by examining jumping, kicking and falling phases of its execution. Given the rarity of players who have acquired this skill, we found five subjects for the study. Twenty-three trials were captured and quantified. The results unveil the following key elements: 1) the control of trunk rotation during the jumping, 2) the angle between thighs upon take-off, 3) the whip-like control of the kicking leg during airborne, 4) timing between ball motion and limbs&amp;rsquo; coordination, and 5) damping mechanism during falling. An accurate kick can only be achieved through repetitive training. This underlines the need for athletes to master a safe landing technique that minimizes risk of injury during practice. Therefore, training should begin with learning a safe falling technique.","This paper presents a biomechanical preliminary study on the jumping side volley in soccer, emphasizing the lack of scientific literature on this skill. Key factors for coaching are identified through 3D motion capture analysis, including trunk rotation control, thigh angle during take-off, kicking leg coordination, and safe landing techniques to minimize injury risk."
Estimation of injury costs: financial damage of English Premier League teams’ underachievement due to injuries,2020-05-01,,,,"In individual sports, the effect that injuries have on an athlete's performance, success and financial profit is implicit. In contrast, the effect of a single player's injury or one player's absence in team sports is much more difficult to quantify, both from the performance perspective and the financial perspective.In this study, we attempted to estimate the effect of injuries on the performance of football teams from the English Premier League (EPL), and the financial implications derived from this effect.Our analysis is based on data regarding game results, injuries and estimations of the players' financial value for the 2012-2013 through the 2016-2017 seasons.We found a statistically significant relationship (r=-0.46, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.28, p=0.001) between the number of days out due to injuries suffered by team members during a season and the place difference between their actual and expected finish in the EPL table (according to overall player value). Moreover, we can interpolate that approximately 136 days out due to injury causes a team the loss of one league point, and that approximately 271 days out due to injury costs a team one place in the table. This interpolation formula is used as a heuristic model, and given the relationship specified above accounts for a significant portion of the variance in league placement (21%), the remaining variance is related to other factors. Calculating the costs of wage bills and prize money, we estimate that an EPL team loses an average of £45 million sterling due to injury-related decrement in performance per season.Professional football clubs have a strong economic incentive to invest in injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes.","This paper investigates the financial impact of injuries on the performance of English Premier League (EPL) teams, analyzing data from the 2012-2013 to 2016-2017 seasons. The findings reveal a significant correlation between injury days and league performance, estimating an average annual financial loss of £45 million per team due to injuries, thereby highlighting the importance of investing in injury prevention and rehabilitation."
Association of artificial turf and concussion in competitive contact sports: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-05-01,,,,"To determine the incidence of head injuries and concussion in contact sports, comparing natural grass with artificial turf surfaces.Systematic review and meta-analysis via the RevMan V.5.3 software.All studies describing competitive contact sports played on both natural grass and artificial turf. The primary outcome measured was occurrence of head injury and concussion.The databases include PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Medline and Sport Discus. The last search took place on 23 May 2019. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale evaluated the methodological quality of the selected studies with a funnel plot designed to determine publication bias. Study screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers.Initial screening generated 42 publications, with 12 meeting criteria for inclusion. Eight studies described concussion only. The rate ratio (RR) of head injury and concussion was less on artificial turf compared with natural grass (RR=0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04) as was the rate ratio of concussion only (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.89).Analysis of published data demonstrates a decreased incidence of head injury and concussion when contact sports are played on artificial turf. This difference was most marked for sports such as rugby and American football. However, artificial turf has no association with the incidence of head injury or concussion while playing soccer.","This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence of head injuries and concussions in contact sports, comparing natural grass to artificial turf surfaces.

Performance Related Parameters Determining the Selection of Youth Players in Soccer,2020-04-30,,,,"In the current study, a total of 86 soccer’s players with mean age of 14 years drawn from Terengganu soccer academy were tested in performing 10 parameters aiming at determining the performance of those players based on assessing the contribution of each activity and its corresponding significant level. The 10 performance related parameters involved anthropometry (BMI), fitness test (agility, coordination, muscular endurance (push and sit up), power, YoYo level), and football skill test (dribbling with ball, dribbling without ball and juggling). All the parameters testing is carried out based on international standard and performed by well-trained staff. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to achieve the objective in this study. Result shows a positive correlation between the two types of muscular parameters; the power is influenced by BMI and coordination; the specific football tests are highly impacted by the power and agility. The coefficient of determination and the significance level -values show that the parameters that can be significantly considered are the anthropometric BMI (0.020), agility (0.025), muscular endurance (0.039 and 0.043), power (0.039), special football test without the ball (0.041), and juggling (0.046). The coordination, YoYo, football special test with the ball were not found to be significantly accounted for preparing the young players to achieve the required performance. Based on the results of the coefficient of determination and the significance -values of the parameters, a model was proposed to determine the highest and lowest parameters that play important roles in the selection of young players.","This paper examines the performance-related parameters that influence the selection of youth soccer players, focusing on 10 key metrics including anthropometry, fitness tests, and football skills. The study identifies significant correlations between muscular parameters, agility, and specific football tests, proposing a model for assessing which attributes are most critical for player selection at a youth level."
Inertial Sensor-Based Motion Tracking in Football with Movement Intensity Quantification,2020-04-29,,,,"Inertial sensor-based measurements of lower body kinematics in football players may improve physical load estimates during training sessions and matches. However, the validity of inertial-based motion analysis systems is specific to both the type of movement and the intensity at which movements are executed. Importantly, such a system should be relatively simple, so it can easily be used in daily practice. This paper introduces an easy-to-use inertial-based motion analysis system and evaluates its validity using an optoelectronic motion analysis system as a gold standard. The system was validated in 11 football players for six different football specific movements that were executed at low, medium, and maximal intensity. Across all movements and intensities, the root mean square differences (means ± SD) for knee and hip flexion/extension angles were 5.3° ± 3.4° and 8.0° ± 3.5°, respectively, illustrating good validity with the gold standard. In addition, mean absolute flexion/extension angular velocities significantly differed between the three movement intensities. These results show the potential to use the inertial based motion analysis system in football practice to obtain lower body kinematics and to quantify movement intensity, which both may improve currently used physical load estimates of the players.","This paper focuses on the development and validation of an easy-to-use inertial sensor-based motion analysis system for quantifying lower body kinematics and movement intensity in football players. The study validates the system against an optoelectronic motion analysis standard, demonstrating good validity for measuring knee and hip flexion/extension angles across various movement intensities, which can enhance physical load estimates in training and matches."
Effect of Foot Morphology and Anthropometry on Bipedal Postural Balance,2020-04-27,,,,"Maintenance of accurate postural balance is imperative to avoid falls and incapacities especially in overweight and older population. Normal postural balance is affected by various factors like age, gender, body characteristics like lean muscle mass, soft tissue mass, stature, foot anthropometry, etc. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1000 young population of north Karnataka in which human stature, weight, body mass index, foot anthropometric parameters, etc. along with postural sway were measured. The correlation of these parameters with human stature, weight and postural sway was studied. Data obtained were tabulated, graphically represented and statistically analyzed. Correlation coefficient was formulated for each variable. Foot length and width showed positive significant correlation with height, weight and other variables. Study observations were compared with those obtained from previous studies. The study observations will enable us to understand the influence of foot anthropometry on postural balance and help researchers to formulate weight transfer strategies, thereby facilitating management and rehabilitation of patients with postural instability.","This paper investigates the impact of foot morphology and anthropometry on bipedal postural balance, particularly in the context of the overweight and older population. A cross-sectional study of 1,000 young individuals assessed various body characteristics and their correlations with postural sway, highlighting significant relationships between foot dimensions and other anthropometric measures essential for understanding and managing postural instability."
Sex and Sport Differences in College Lacrosse and Soccer Head Impact Biomechanics,2020-04-23,,,,"Sport-related head impact biomechanics research has been male-centric and focused primarily on American football and ice hockey, which do not address popular sports in which both sexes participate. The purpose of this study was to quantify college female and male lacrosse and soccer head impact biomechanics.Head impact biomechanics were collected from college lacrosse and soccer players across two Division 1 college athletic programs (96 female athletes, 141 male athletes; age, 19.8 ± 1.3 yr; height, 174.8 ± 9.2 cm; mass, 72.4 ± 11.7 kg). We deployed helmetless head impact measurement devices (X2 Biosystems xPatch) before each event. Peak linear and rotational accelerations were log-transformed for random intercepts general linear mixed models, and subsequently categorized based on impact magnitude for additional categorical analyses.Most linear (69.4%) and rotational (72.3%) head impact accelerations sustained by our study cohort were categorized as mild. On average, male athletes sustained impacts with higher linear accelerations than females (P = 0.04), and lacrosse athletes sustained higher linear acceleration impacts than soccer athletes (P = 0.023). Soccer athletes sustained significantly higher-magnitude impacts during competitions versus practices (linear, P < 0.001, rotational, P < 0.001), whereas lacrosse athletes sustained higher-magnitude impacts during practices versus competition (linear, P < 0.001; rotational, P < 0.001). Male athletes sustained higher accelerations in competitions versus practice (linear, P = 0.004; rotational, P < 0.001), whereas female athletes sustained higher accelerations in practice versus competitions (linear, P < 0.001; rotational, P = 0.02). There were no interactions between sex and sport on impact magnitude.Male athletes and lacrosse athletes experience higher-magnitude head impacts. Given the limited literature in this area, future research should continue characterizing head impact biomechanics in women's and nonhelmeted sports as well as validate nonhelmeted head impact technologies.","This study quantifies head impact biomechanics in college lacrosse and soccer, highlighting significant differences in impact magnitudes between male and female athletes, as well as between the two sports. The findings indicate that male lacrosse players experience the highest linear accelerations, while female athletes sustain more impacts during practice, underscoring a gap in research on head impact biomechanics in non-helmeted sports."

Effect of Sand on Landing Knee Valgus During Single-Leg Land and Drop Jump Tasks: Possible Implications for ACL Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation,2020-04-01,,,,"Despite significant emphasis on anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention, injury rates continue to rise and reinjury is common. Interventions to reduce injury have included resistance, balance, and jump training elements. The use of sand-based jump training has been postulated as an effective treatment. However, evidence on landing mechanics is limited.To determine potential differences in landing strategies and subsequent landing knee valgus when performing single-leg landing (SLL) and drop jump (DJ) tasks onto sand and land, and to compare between both male and female populations.A randomized repeated-measures crossover design.University laboratory.Thirty-one participants (20 males and 11 females) from a university population.All participants completed DJ and SLL tasks on both sand and land surfaces.Two-dimensional frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) of knee valgus was measured in both the DJ and SLL tasks (right and left) for both sand and land conditions.FPPA was lower (moderate to large effect) for SLL in sand compared with land in both legs (left: 4.3° [2.8°]; right: 4.1° [3.8°]) for females. However, effects were unclear (left: -0.7° [2.2°]) and trivial for males (right: -1.1° [1.9°]). FPPA differences for males and females performing DJ were unclear; thus, more data is required. Differences in FPPA (land vs sand) with respect to grouping (sex) for both SLL left (4.9° [3.0°]) and right (5.1° [4.0°]) were very likely higher (small)/possibly moderate for females compared with males.The effects of sand on FPPA during DJ tasks in males and females are unclear, and further data is required. However, the moderate to large reductions in FPPA in females during SLL tasks suggest that sand may provide a safer alternative to firm ground for female athletes in anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention and rehabilitation programs, which involve a SLL component.","This paper investigates the impact of sand surfaces on landing knee valgus during single-leg land and drop jump tasks, with a focus on potential implications for ACL injury prevention. The findings reveal that sand reduces knee valgus in female participants during single-leg land tasks, indicating it may serve as a safer training surface, while effects in males remain ambiguous and need further investigation."
The Influence of Soccer Playing Surface on the Loading Response to Ankle (P)Rehabilitation Exercises,2020-04-01,,,,"Contemporary synthetic playing surfaces have been associated with an increased risk of ankle injury in the various types of football. Triaxial accelerometers facilitate in vivo assessment of planar mechanical loading on the player.To quantify the influence of playing surface on the PlayerLoad elicited during footwork and plyometric drills focused on the mechanism of ankle injury.Repeated-measures, field-based design.Regulation soccer pitches.A total of 15 amateur soccer players (22.1 [2.4] y), injury free with ≥6 years competitive experience.Each player completed a test battery comprising 3 footwork drills (anterior, lateral, and diagonal) and 4 plyometric drills (anterior hop, inversion hop, eversion hop, and diagonal hop) on natural turf (NT), third-generation artificial turf (3G), and AstroTurf. Global positioning system sensors were located at C7 and the mid-tibia of each leg to measure triaxial acceleration (100 Hz).PlayerLoad in each axial plane was calculated for each drill on each surface and at each global positioning system location.Analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect for sensor location in all drills, with PlayerLoad higher at mid-tibia than at C7 in all movement planes. AstroTurf elicited significantly higher PlayerLoad in the mediolateral and anteroposterior planes, with typically no difference between NT and 3G. In isolated inversion and eversion hopping trials, the 3G surface also elicited lower PlayerLoad than NT.PlayerLoad magnitude was sensitive to unit placement, advocating measurement with greater anatomical relevance when using microelectromechanical systems technology to monitor training or rehabilitation load. AstroTurf elicited higher PlayerLoad across all planes and drills and should be avoided for rehabilitative purposes, whereas 3G elicited a similar mechanical response to NT.","This paper investigates the impact of different soccer playing surfaces on the loading response during ankle rehabilitation exercises. It finds that AstroTurf generates significantly higher PlayerLoad compared to natural turf and third-generation artificial turf, suggesting that AstroTurf should be avoided for rehabilitation due to the increased risk of injury, while 3G surfaces show similar mechanical responses to natural turf."
PROSPECTIVE MEASURES OF INTRA-REGION BRAIN REGULARITY DIFFERENTIATES ACL INJURED AND UNINJURED ATHLETES,2020-04-01,,,,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are debilitating for athletes. While numerous motor and biomechanical deficits contribute to the inciting ACL injury mechanism, the limited knowledge about the underlying neural drivers of these deficits has impeded intervention development to reduce ACL injury rates. A prospective investigation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in female soccer players revealed decreased connectivity between the primary somatosensory cortex and cerebellum for athletes that went on to ACL injury athletes compared to their healthy teammates. Although information about inter-region connectivity patterns is informative, this finding does elucidate the individual, intra-region brain activity that may be further underlie ACL injury mechanisms. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the intra-region regularity of the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal activity in 25 knee-related regions of interests (ROI) between athletes who sustained an ACL injury and matched controls. Methods: Adolescent female soccer athletes were evaluated using fMRI to capture resting-state brain connectivity prior to their competitive season. Two of these athletes (16.0±0yrs, 169.0±2.8cm, 60.1±8.3kg) later experienced an ACL injury and were matched to eight uninjured teammates (15.9±0.8yrs, 164.0±4.9cm, 58.3±7.6kg). Standard fMRI data processing was used to determine resting-state BOLD signal activity in 25 knee-related ROIs. Sample entropy (SampEn) was then used to quantify the regularity of each individual ROI. A lower SampEn value indicates a ROI’s BOLD signal activity was more regular (predictable) and a higher value indicates a signal’s activity was more irregular (unpredictable). T-tests—with a Bonferroni correction for the familywise error rate ( p &lt; .002)—were used to compare SampEn values between both groups for all 25 ROIs. Results: ACL injured athletes ( M = 0.35±0.01) exhibited higher SampEn values in the left primary motor cortex than matched, uninjured athletes ( M = 0.29±0.02; t(8)=4.62, p=.0017, d=3.65). Conclusion: Athletes who sustained an ACL injury exhibited less regularity in BOLD signal activity of the left primary motor cortex. As the primary motor cortex serves as the final destination in the brain before efferent information is sent to the spinal cord to initiate movement, decreased BOLD signal regularity in this region may alter such cortical-spinal transmission. Considering ACL injuries often occur during unpredictable environments, irregular activity of motor cortex activity may dampen an athlete’s ability to sustain a safe knee position. These findings may help to guide development of brain-driven biofeedback training to promote adaptive neuroplasticity that ‘pushes’ the motor cortex towards more regular activity. [Figure: see text]","This study investigates the intra-region brain activity related to ACL injuries in female soccer players, using fMRI to analyze blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal regularity in knee-related brain regions. Findings reveal that athletes who later sustained an ACL injury exhibited higher irregularity in BOLD signal activity of the left primary motor cortex, suggesting a potential neurophysiological marker for injury risk and guiding future neuroplasticity training interventions."
EFFECTS OF NEUROMUSCULAR TRAINING ON BIOMECHANICAL EFFICIENCY IN HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES,2020-04-01,,,,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common and devastating sports-related knee injuries. Neuromuscular training (NMT) has demonstrated efficacy as a preventive intervention for ACL injury and has been associated with improvements in measures of sports performance, but the specific physiologic mechanisms that serve as protective factors and contribute to improved performance haven not been well-defined. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between NMT and biomechanical efficiency among high school athletes. We hypothesized that the performance of NMT is associated with improved biomechanical efficiency during the performance of fundamental movements and agility tests when compared to a group of untrained control subjects. Methods: Eight high school soccer and basketball teams (111 athletes, 53.1% male, mean age 15.6 years) were recruited and assigned to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group performed NMT as part of their warm-up prior to each practice and competition for 12 weeks. NMT was administered by experienced sports medicine clinicians who provided exercise instruction, technique cues, and performance feedback throughout each training session. The control group performed their customary warm-up under the direction of the team’s coaches. Biomechanical efficiency was assessed through performance of static and dynamic tests using an FDA-approved wireless sensor system. Agility was assessed using a timed three-cone agility test. All tests were administered immediately prior to and following each competitive sports season. Results: Matched pre-/post-season data was collected from 74 athletes (67%). Significant improvements [point estimate (95% CI) p-value] were observed in the intervention group for left lower extremity [0.25 (0.06,0.45) p = 0.01] and right lower extremity [0.21 (0.05,0.37) p = 0.01] loading/landing speed ratios during a single leg hop test, left lower extremity [-136.34 (-225.74,-46.95) p = 0.003] and right lower extremity [-110 (-211.36,-8.64) p = 0.03] ground reaction force, left lower extremity [-1.03, (-.189,-0.18) p = 0.02] and right lower extremity [-0.94 (-1.73,-0.14) p = 0.02] initial peak acceleration, and cadence [-12.12 (-21.60,-2.65) p = 0.01] during a straight-line running acceleration/deceleration test, and time [0.51 (0.24,0.78) p = 0.0003] during a three-cone agility test. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that season-long, sport-specific, age-appropriate NMT administered by sports medicine clinicians can significantly improve biomechanical efficiency during the performance of fundamental movements and agility tests by high school athletes. To achieve similar results, sports coaches should be trained to provide exercise instruction, technique cues, and performance feedback when administering NMT in real-world settings. [Table: see text][Table: see text]","The paper investigates the effects of neuromuscular training (NMT) on biomechanical efficiency in high school athletes, specifically focusing on its role in improving performance and reducing the risk of ACL injuries. Results indicate that a season-long NMT intervention significantly enhances various biomechanical measures during fundamental movements and agility tests when compared to a control group."
USING MOVEMENT SCREENING TESTS AND BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS TO DIFFERENTIATE POST-CONCUSSION PEDIATRIC SOCCER ATHLETES FROM HEALTHY CONTROLS,2020-04-01,,,,"Background: Recently, 2 controlled prospective studies of collegiate student-athletes identified 1.6 to 2.5 increased risk of subsequent lower extremity injury following concussion (Books et al., 2016; Lynall et al., 2015). The purpose of the study is to determine the potential clinical utility and application of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), Y Balance Test (YBT), Tuck Jump Assessment (TJA), and Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) in a sample of post-concussion soccer athletes and a sample of healthy age and gender matched soccer athlete controls to identify differences. Differentiation was defined as significance in raw score performance on the FMS, YBT, TJA, LESS. Prospective data was collected on lower extremity injury within 6-months post-concussion. Methods: The study participants were administered the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS in successive order by a licensed athletic trainer. All measures were administered in a biomechanical lab setting. Post-concussion soccer athletes were administered the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS after receiving formal medical clearance from a licensed physician. Post-concussion soccer athletes were matched with healthy soccer athlete controls by age, gender, and years of participation. All study participants were administered screening measures at rest. All demographic and raw data were summarized using descriptive statistics with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals calculated for all end points. Independent sample t-tests were performed at &lt;0.05 to measure significant differences between groups. Results: 50 (17 female, 33 male; mean age=14.1; mean years of participation=6.8) post-concussion soccer athletes and 50 (17 female, 33 male; mean age=14.3; mean years of participation=6.7) matched soccer athlete controls were administered the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS. Significant differences were observed between the post-concussion and control groups on FMS Deep Squat ( t=-9.76, p=&lt;0.001), Inline Lung ( t=-8.43, p=&lt;0.001), and LESS total score (t=-9.21, p=&lt;0.001). No other significant differences were observed. Conclusions: The current study identified the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS as potential movement screening tests in which differences could be observed in a sample of post-concussion and healthy control soccer athletes. Results from the current study identified specific differences between groups with respect to movement screening test performance on the FMS Deep Squat, Inline Lunge, and LESS total score. Further research is warranted to clearly define the observed differences. Clinicians should consider these findings when providing recommendations and discussing recovery in concussion patients.","This study investigates the utility of movement screening tests (Functional Movement Screen, Y Balance Test, Tuck Jump Assessment, and Landing Error Scoring System) to differentiate between post-concussion soccer athletes and healthy controls. Significant differences in scores on specific tests were found, suggesting these assessments may help clinicians in evaluating recovery in pediatric athletes following a concussion."
ALTERED BRAIN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY FOLLOWING A SEASON OF COMPETITIVE FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER AND THE EFFECT OF A JUGULAR VEIN COMPRESSION COLLAR: A NETWORK-BASED STATISTICS ANALYSIS,2020-04-01,,,,"Background: Cumulative exposure to repetitive sub-concussive head impacts in contact sports may have deleterious effects on brain function, even in the absence of acute symptoms. Moreover, anatomical and biomechanical factors may predispose female athletes to higher risk compared to males. At present, there is no effective injury prevention strategy to protect female athletes from sports-related head impact. Hypothesis/Purpose: (1). We aimed to use resting-state fMRI to investigate the effect of a full season of competitive soccer on brain functional network integrity in female high school athletes. (2). We also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a jugular vein compression neck collar device, designed to mitigate potential injury by reducing the brain slosh effect. Methods: A total of 125 high school female soccer athletes were included in this study. These athletes were assigned randomly to a non-collar (n=55, age=16.06±1.06 yrs) or collar group (n=70, 15.81±0.95 yrs) before the season started. High resolution 3D T1-weighted images and resting-state fMRI data were collected prospectively at pre-season and again at post-season. Data processing and analysis were conducted in the MATLAB-based programs Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) and Connectivity Toolbox (Conn). Functional connectivity was computed between each pair of 105 anatomically delineated regions of interest (ROI). Network Based Statistics were applied to detect coherent patterns of altered connectivity from pre- to post-season. Results: The non-collar group showed a significant pattern of altered connectivity (p-FWE = 0.047) spanning 60% of ROIs (63/105) and 1.7% of ROI-ROI connections (94/5,460). 65 of the 94 altered connections were weakened from pre-to-post season and tended to occur in the right hemisphere. 29 of the 94 altered connections were strengthened from pre-to-post season and tended to involve regions in the occipital lobe. The collar group did not show any statistically significant change (p-FWE = 0.223). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that exposure to repetitive sub-concussive head impacts during a single season of competitive female soccer induces changes in brain functional connectivity. The observed increases and decreases of functional connectivity strength comprising the pattern of altered connectivity are congruent with a heterogeneous response to insult wherein some connections are reduced in strength due to neuronal damage and other “detour” connections are strengthened to preserve network function. Comparatively, the absence of alterations in the collar group suggest that the jugular vein compression collar may have generated a potentially protective effect to preserve brain functional network integrity during exposure to head impacts. [Figure: see text]","The paper investigates the impact of repetitive sub-concussive head impacts on the brain functional connectivity of female high school soccer players during a competitive season and assesses the protective effect of a jugular vein compression collar. Results indicate that the non-collar group exhibited significant alterations in brain connectivity, while the collar group showed no significant changes, suggesting a potential protective role of the collar against head impact-related alterations in brain function."
The Effects of Cold Water Immersion on the Recovery of Drop Jump Performance and Mechanics: A Pilot Study in Under-20 Soccer Players,2020-03-31,,,,"Cold water immersion (CWI) is a popular method used for enhancing recovery from exercise. However, the efficacy of this approach is inconclusive and studies investigating variables contributing to overall performance are scarce. Additionally, few studies have investigated the recovery of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) performance after a fatiguing SSC task. The SSC occurs naturally in human locomotion and induces a recovery pattern different from isolated muscle contractions (e.g., pure eccentric exercise). Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single CWI on jumping performance and mechanics after exhaustive SSC exercise. On a sledge apparatus, ten male under-20 soccer players (age 18-20 years) performed five sets of 20 maximal drop jumps (DJ) followed by continuous submaximal rebounding. Subjects were equally randomized into a passive recovery control (CON) or CWI group (10±0.5°C for 20 minutes). Prior to, upon completion of, and at 24 (24H) and 48-hour (48H) follow-ups, subjects performed maximal DJs recorded with a high-speed video camera. Blood samples were taken and subjective muscle soreness was measured. Rebound jump height was impaired immediately after exercise, although significant only for CWI (CON: -12.4 cm, p = 0.083; CWI: -9.9 cm, p = 0.009). The CWI group demonstrated significant recovery of jump height at 24H (+6.3 cm, p = 0.031) and 48H (+8.9 cm, p = 0.002) compared to post-exercise. Ankle joint stiffness was decreased for CWI (-2.1 to -2.5 Nm/deg, p = 0.005-0.041). Creatine kinase activity was similarly increased for both groups at 24H and 48H, while there was also no group effect in muscle soreness (p ≥ 0.056). This pilot study demonstrates the potential for CWI to slightly enhance the recovery of DJ performance. However, this occurred in parallel with reduced ankle joint stiffness, signifying that jumps were performed with less efficiency, which would not be favourable for repeated SSC actions. While this should be confirmed with a larger sample size, this highlights the potential for CWI to be detrimental to the mechanical properties of the ankle joint. Therefore, future recovery intervention studies should concomitantly investigate variables contributing to performance, rather than just overall performance itself.","The paper investigates the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) on jump performance and mechanics following exhaustive stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) exercise in under-20 soccer players. Key findings indicate that while CWI may enhance recovery of jump height at 24 and 48 hours post-exercise, it is associated with decreased ankle joint stiffness, suggesting potential implications for performance efficiency during repeated SSC activities."
Effect of Two Strength Training Models on Muscle Power and Strength in Elite Women’s Football Players,2020-03-30,,,,"This study evaluates changes in power and strength after implementing two different models of 9-week strength training in elite women's football players. A group of 13 players (age 20.2 ± 3.3 years, body mass 57.2 ± 3.7 kg, height 163.6 ± 5.3 cm, VO2max 45.2 ± ml/min) underwent either a complex (the intermittent load type) or combined (the maximal strength and dynamic method) model of training. The training load was tailored to each athlete. Results showed that the complex model of training improved power (10 W/kg, p = 0.006) and height of vertical jump (5.3 cm, p = 0.001), weight of 1 Repeat Maximum (1RM) which was (5.8 kg, p = 0.015), power and speed in the acceleration phase of barbell half squats (BHS) at weights from 20 to 60 kg, and the number of repetitions in BHS (10.3%, p = 0.012). The combined model of training improved the time of shuttle run (0.44 s, p = 0.000), weight of 1RM in BHS (9.6kg, p = 0.000) and BP (4 kg, p = 0.000), power in the acceleration phase of BHS at weights from 50 to 60 kg, the number of repetitions in BP (14.3%, p = 0.000), BHS (9.4%, p = 0.002), barbell bench pulls (11.9%, p = 0.002) and sit-ups (7.7%, p = 0.001). These findings indicate that the complex model of training improves explosive abilities, whereas the combined model is effective for developing strength at weights close to players' 1RM and for repeatedly overcoming resistance. Therefore, coaches should choose the training model based on the needs of individual players.","This study investigates the effects of two different strength training models on muscle power and strength in elite women's football players. Results indicate that the complex training model enhances explosive abilities, while the combined model is more effective for building strength near the players' one-repetition maximum (1RM), suggesting that training approaches should be tailored to individual athlete needs."
The correlation between jump height and mechanical power in a countermovement jump is artificially inflated,2020-03-23,,,,"The countermovement jump is commonly used to assess an athlete's neuromuscular capacity. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism behind the strong correlation between jump height and mechanical power in a countermovement jump. Three athletes each performed between 47 and 60 maximal-effort countermovement jumps on a force platform. For all three athletes, peak mechanical power and average mechanical power were strongly correlated with jump height (r = 0.54–0.90). The correlation between jump height and peak power was largely determined by the correlation between jump height and the velocity at peak power (r = 0.83–0.94) and was not related to the correlation between jump height and the ground reaction force at peak power (r = −0.20–0.18). These results confirm that the strong correlation between jump height and power is an artefact arising from how power is calculated. Power is a compound variable calculated from the product of instantaneous ground reaction force and instantaneous velocity, and application of statistical theory shows that the correlation between jump height and power is artificially inflated by the near-perfect correlation between jump height and the velocity at peak power. Despite this finding, mechanical power might still be useful in assessing the neuromuscular capacity of an athlete.","This paper investigates the correlation between jump height and mechanical power in countermovement jumps, revealing that the observed strong correlation is artificially inflated due to the relationship between jump height and velocity at peak power. The findings suggest that the correlation is not inherently meaningful, though mechanical power may still serve as a valuable indicator of an athlete's neuromuscular capacity."
Associations between sport participation and knee symptoms: a cross-sectional study involving 3053 undergraduate students,2020-03-23,,,,"Abstract Background While a number of studies have investigated knee symptoms among elite athletes, few have directly compared the association between engagement in different sports and knee symptoms among young adults in the general population. The current study aimed to investigate the relation between sports participation hours, type/ number of sports engaged, self-rated competitiveness and knee symptoms among undergraduates. Methods Undergraduates were invited to participate in a self-administered online survey through invitation emails. Respondents were instructed to provide demographic information (e.g., age, gender, sports participation hours, types of engaged sports, self-rated competitiveness in sports and anxiety level etc.) and to report knee symptoms (current, the last 7 days, the last 12 months, and lifetime). Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to investigate the association between sports participation and current knee symptoms. Results Of 17,552 invitees, 3744 responded to the survey. Valid data from 3053 respondents was used for analysis. Forty-four percent of the respondents engaged in sports regularly (≥once per week). Running, cross-training and swimming were the most frequently participated sports among the respondents. The current prevalence rate of knee symptoms was 6.4%. Hours spent participating in combat sports, soccer, yoga, and basketball participation hours were significantly associated with current knee symptoms. Respondents who rated themselves as “competitive” demonstrated a higher risk of having current knee symptoms than “recreational” players. Number of engaged sports was not associated with current knee symptoms among undergraduates. Conclusions Certain sports types were associated with current knee symptoms. Compared to self-rated “recreational” players, self-rated “competitive” players were more likely to have current knee symptoms. Students should take preventive measures to minimize their risk of developing knee symptoms, especially when participating in combat sports, soccer, yoga, and basketball, or engaging in sports at a highly competitive level.","This study investigates the relationship between different types of sports participation and knee symptoms among undergraduate students. It finds that participation in combat sports, soccer, yoga, and basketball is significantly associated with knee symptoms, and that self-rated competitive players have a higher risk of experiencing these symptoms compared to recreational players."
Validation of a Device to Measure Knee Joint Angles for a Dynamic Movement,2020-03-21,,,,"Participation in sports has risen in the United States over the last few years, increasing the risk of injuries such as tears to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee. Previous studies have shown a correlation between knee kinematics when landing from a jump and this injury. The purpose of this study was to validate the ability of a commercially available inertial measurement units (IMUs) to accurately measure knee joint angles during a dynamic movement. Eight healthy subjects participated in the study. Validation was performed by comparing the angles measured by the wearable device to those obtained through the gold standard motion capture system when landing from a jump. Root mean square, linear regression analysis, and Bland–Altman plots were performed/constructed. The mean difference between the wearable device and the motion capture data was 8.4° (flexion/extension), 4.9° (ab/adduction), and 3.9° (rotation). In addition, the device was more accurate at smaller knee angles. In our study, a commercially available wearable IMU was able to perform fairly well under certain conditions and was less accurate in other conditions.","This paper focuses on the validation of a wearable device using inertial measurement units (IMUs) for measuring knee joint angles during dynamic movements, specifically landing from a jump. The study found that while the device performed adequately in measuring knee angles, it had varying accuracy depending on the angle, with mean differences noted in flexion/extension, ab/adduction, and rotation compared to a motion capture system."
Influence of competition on performance factors in under-19 soccer players at national league level,2020-03-19,,,,"The aim of this study was to analyse and quantify the acute effects of competition on several performance factors in under-19 male soccer players. To this end, 198 national league players (17.56 ± 0.78 years) performed various tests to measure jump capacity, kicking velocity and sprint times immediately pre-match (T1), at half-time (T2) and post-match (T3). Tests included kicking the ball to measure ball velocity (KICK), sprinting for 40 meters, timing the first 30 meters (30mACCEL), the last 10 meters (10mACCEL) and the total distance (40mACCEL), and performing countermovement jumps (CMJ). For subsequent analysis, the sample was divided into 5 playing positions: goalkeepers (n = 24), defenders (n = 51), midfielders (n = 36), wingers (n = 54) and forwards (n = 33). For all positions, we found a significant decline in performance (p<0.05) for kicking velocity (2.91% - 6.51%) and sprinting (0.44%-5.85%). For the CMJ, all positions except defenders presented a significant decline in performance that ranged from 1.5% to 4.56%. These findings highlight the need to individualise fitness training, taking into account the match needs and demands of the different playing positions in order to minimise the effects of match fatigue and accelerate post-match recovery.","This study investigates the acute effects of competition on performance factors in under-19 male soccer players, analyzing jump capacity, kicking velocity, and sprint times at different match intervals. The results indicate a significant decline in performance across various playing positions, emphasizing the importance of tailored fitness training to address match-related fatigue and enhance recovery strategies."
Methodology and exercises to reduce the hamstring injury risk: from literature knowledges to the field,2020-03-19,,,,"Injury prevention is a topic that has received greater attention in recent years: in fact, even if knowledge and research about prevention has increased, the injury incidence remains very high, especially as regards the hamstring district. As can be seen from the scientific literature, there are many studies that have described risk factors, but above all what strategies can be used to decrease this incidence through the prevention exercises. The exercise considered the gold standard for the hamstring injuries prevention is the Nordic hamstring although the literature highlights the particular complexity of the anatomical district of hamstrings. For these reasons, it seems simplistic and reductive to assume that one exercise is sufficient. In this study is proposed further exercises proposed in the literature that can integrate the traditional Nordic hamstring and help to activate more fully all the muscle heads that make up the hamstrings. In conclusion, in a prevention session or in a strength session, in addition to the Nordic hamstring exercise, other exercises could be included, such as the Laying Kick, the Standing Kick, the Nordic bump, the Nordic with return, the Cranes and the Cranes return.",This paper discusses methodologies and exercises aimed at reducing the risk of hamstring injuries in sports. It emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on the Nordic hamstring exercise and proposes integrating additional exercises to effectively engage all muscle heads of the hamstrings for enhanced injury prevention.
Read-the-game: System for skill-based visual exploratory activity assessment with a full body virtual reality soccer simulation,2020-03-17,,,,"We present a novel virtual reality (VR) system to measure soccer players' read-the-game ability. Read-the-game is a term that encompasses a conglomerate of visual exploratory behavioral patterns and cognitive elements required to make accurate in-game decisions. Our technological approach in the Sports Science domain focuses on the visuomotor component of targeted skill development in a VR simulation because VR is a powerful perception-action coupling training solution for visuomotor coordination due to its high sense of immersion and its psychological byproduct presence. Additionally, we analyze two critical aspects: psychological (i.e., sense of presence) and the human-computer interaction (HCI) domain (i.e., suitable input device for full-body immersion). To measure head movements related to visual explorations, the system tracks the user's head excursions. Specifically, the engaged visual exploratory activity (VEA) during a VR simulation is measured frame-by-frame at runtime to study the behavior of players making passing decisions while experiencing pressure from rivals during in-game situations recreated with computer graphics (CG). Additionally, the sense of presence elicited by our system is measured via the Igroup Presence Questionnaire applied to beginner and amateur soccer players (n = 24). Regarding the HCI aspect, a comparison of input options reveals that a high presence can be achieved when using full body interactions that integrate head and body motions via a combination of an HMD and kinetic body tracking. During our system verification, a difference in the VEA performance is observed between beginner and amateur players. Moreover, we demonstrate the capacity of the system to measure the VEA while evoking immersive soccer in-match experiences with a portable VR setup.","The paper presents a virtual reality (VR) system designed to assess soccer players' ""read-the-game"" ability, which includes visual exploratory behaviors and cognitive processes necessary for decision-making during matches. Key aspects of the study include the evaluation of player behavior under pressure, the measurement of visual exploratory activity using head tracking, and the exploration of psychological presence and human-computer interaction through full-body immersion in a VR environment."
Mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament loading during dynamic motor tasks,2020-03-17,,,,"Abstract This study determined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) force and its contributors during a standardized drop-land-lateral jump task using a validated computational model. Healthy females (n=24) who were recreationally active performed drop-land-lateral jump and straight run tasks. Three-dimensional whole-body kinematics, ground reaction forces, and muscle activation patterns from eight lower limb muscles were collected concurrently during both tasks, but only the jump was analyzed computationally, with the run included for model calibration. External biomechanics, muscle-tendon unit kinematics, and muscle activation patterns were used to model lower limb muscle and ACL forces. Peak ACL force (2.3±0.5 BW) was observed at 13% of the stance phase during the drop-land-lateral jump task. The ACL force was primarily developed through the sagittal plane, and muscle was the dominant source of ACL loading. The gastrocnemii and quadriceps were main ACL antagonists (i.e., loaders), while hamstrings were the main ACL agonists (i.e., supporters).","This paper investigates the loading mechanisms of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during dynamic tasks, specifically through a standardized drop-land-lateral jump. It identifies key contributors to ACL force, emphasizing that the gastrocnemii and quadriceps primarily load the ACL, while the hamstrings act as supporters, with peak ACL force occurring early in the stance phase of the jump."
Does a six-weeks of Hip-focused exercises has the effects on Time to Stabilization after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction?,2020-03-15,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> Background: The investigation of hip muscles on knee functions has been broadly published. The deficits in proximal neuromuscular control has been identified as a contributor to valgus knee which is compromise to knee injuries. The aim of study was to determine the relationship between muscle strength and time taking to maintain the stability. Methods: Thirteen male underwent Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) participated in the six week of hip-focused exercise program. Single leg jump-landing test were performed to determine the Time to Stabilization (TTS). Concentric hip abduction-adduction and knee extension-flexion strength was evaluated muscle peak torques at 60 degree/second. Results: The study demonstrated that there was a strength improvement on both hip and knee muscles. Moreover, the IKDC score was significantly increased (82.71±15.21 to 90.80±8.44) after completed the exercise. We found no correlation between muscle peak torques and TTS. However, there was a moderate relationship between hip abduction and knee extension strength (r=0.624, p =0.023). Conclusion: The main findings suggesting that rehabilitation program targets on strengthen the hip muscles demonstrate an improvement of knee functions in individual with ACLR.","This study investigates the impact of a six-week hip-focused exercise program on Time to Stabilization (TTS) in individuals who have undergone Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR). Key findings indicate improved strength in hip and knee muscles and an increase in the IKDC score, but no correlation between muscle peak torques and TTS was found, highlighting the importance of hip strength in knee rehabilitation."
Which assessments are used to analyze neuromuscular control by electromyography after an anterior cruciate ligament injury to determine readiness to return to sports? A systematic review,2020-03-08,,,,"Abstract Background Adequate neuromuscular control of the knee could be one element to prevent secondary injuries after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. To assess neuromuscular control in terms of time, amplitude and activity, electromyography (EMG) is used. However, it is unclear which assessments using EMG could be used for a safe return to sports (RTS). Therefore, we aimed to summarize EMG-related assessments for neuromuscular control of the knee in adult patients after an ACL injury to decide upon readiness for RTS. Methods This systematic review followed guidelines of Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane recommendations. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), SPORTDiscus and the Web of Science were searched from inception to March 2019 and updated in November 2020. Studies identifying electromyographic assessments for neuromuscular control during dynamic tasks in adult, physically active patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury were eligible and qualitatively synthesized. Two independent reviewers used a modified Downs and Black checklist to assess risk of bias of included studies. Results From initially 1388 hits, 38 mainly cross-sectional, case-controlled studies were included for qualitative analysis. Most studies provided EMG outcomes of thigh muscles during jumping, running or squatting. Outcomes measures described neuromuscular control of the knee in domains of time, amplitude or activity. Risk of bias was medium to high due to an unclear description of participants and prior interventions, confounding factors and incompletely reported results. Conclusions Despite a wide range of EMG outcome measures for neuromuscular control, none was used to decide upon return to sports in these patients. Additional studies are needed to define readiness towards RTS by assessing neuromuscular control in adult ACL patients with EMG. Further research should aim at finding reliable and valid, EMG-related variables to be used as diagnostic tool for neuromuscular control. Moreover, future studies should aim at more homogenous groups including adequately matched healthy subjects, evaluate gender separately and use sport-specific tasks. Registration The protocol for this systematic review was indexed beforehand in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and registered as CRD42019122188.",This systematic review investigates the use of electromyography (EMG) assessments to evaluate neuromuscular control of the knee in adults recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. It identifies a lack of consensus on EMG measures that effectively determine readiness to return to sports and calls for further research to establish reliable diagnostic tools and standardized assessment protocols.
"Psychometric properties of the standardized assessment of concussion in youth football: Validity, reliability, and demographic factors",2020-03-06,,,,"The objective of this study was to determine the psychometrics (reliability, validity) of the original Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) in a youth sample (ages 11 to 13). Demographic factors of race, level of vocabulary knowledge, mother's level of education were also considered. Over 150 youth football athletes completed the SAC and a brief battery of NIH Toolbox cognitive tests as part of a larger study on biomechanical factors in youth sport concussion. This was a within-subjects design (pre-season, post-season assessments), and correlational analysis of convergent and discriminant validity. Between groups analysis based on demographic differences was also employed. The pre-season SAC scores were not different by age; however, SAC scores were statistically different by race: t(155) = 3.162, p = .002, d = .519. Maternal level of education and participant vocabulary scores were related to racial group membership. Convergent and discriminant validity were established compared to NIH Toolbox tests of memory and speed. Pre–post-season tests for 108 participants established marginally acceptable test–retest reliability (ICC = .692). These data support the use of the original SAC in youth football although clinicians must be aware of racial differences in scores.","This paper investigates the psychometric properties of the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) in youth football players aged 11 to 13, focusing on its reliability and validity. It highlights demographic influences, particularly race and maternal education level, on SAC scores, establishing the assessment's reliability and validity while emphasizing the importance of acknowledging racial differences in evaluations."
Player–surface interactions: perception in elite soccer and rugby players on artificial and natural turf,2020-03-04,,,,"Artificial turf (AT) is common at all levels of soccer and rugby. Employing an interdisciplinary design, this study aimed to examine the extent to which the negative attitude commonly expressed by players concerning AT is based on the difference in technique between AT and natural turf (NT), or due to pre-existing biases. Thirty professional soccer and rugby players performed a defined set of movements with masked and normal perception conditions on NT and AT. Two-dimensional kinematic analysis (100 Hz) of characteristics in parallel to a psychological assessment of the impact of cognitive bias for a playing surface was assessed. No significant interaction effects between the level of perception and surface type were found. For AT, contact time (CT) was shorter across conditions, while for NT rugby players had longer CT during acceleration/deceleration phases and shorter flight times. Pre-existing negative bias against AT was found during the normal perception trials in the technology acceptance model (Usefulness and Ease of Use) and the general preference questions on how much the athlete would like to play a game on it. The results suggest that opinion was not driven by surface characteristics, but by a cognitive bias, players brought with them to the pitch.","This study investigates the perceptions of elite soccer and rugby players towards artificial turf (AT) compared to natural turf (NT), focusing on the influence of cognitive biases versus surface characteristics. Kinematic analysis revealed differences in contact time and flight duration during specific movements, indicating that negative attitudes towards AT were driven more by pre-existing biases than by objective performance differences."
Challenges and Future of Wearable Technology in Human Motor-Skill Learning and Optimization,2020-03-04,,,,"Learning how to move is a challenging task. Even the most basic motor skill of walking requires years to develop and can quickly deteriorate due to aging and sedentary lifestyles. More specialized skills such as ballet and acrobatic kicks in soccer require “talent” and years of extensive practice to fully master. These practices can easily cause injuries if conducted improperly. 3D motion capture technologies are currently the best way to acquire human motor skill in biomechanical feedback training. Owing to their tremendous promise for a plethora of applications, wearable technologies have garnered great interest in biofeedback training. Using wearable technology, some physical activity parameters can be tracked in real time and a noninvasive way to indicate the physical progress of a trainee. Yet, the application of biomechanical wearables in human motor-skill learning, training, and optimization is still in its infant phase due to the absence of a reliable method. This chapter elaborates challenges faced by developing wearable biomechanical feedback devices and forecasts potential breakthroughs in this area. The overarching goal is to foster interdisciplinary studies on wearable technology to improve how we move.",This paper discusses the challenges and future prospects of wearable technology in enhancing human motor-skill learning and optimization.

Distal Thigh Compression Garment Improves Female Athlete Knee Control and Sports Movement Safety Perceptions,2020-03-01,,,,"Introduction.This study measured knee frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) and sports safety and performance perceptions of female athletes during a single leg forward hop down and stabilization (SLFHS) for 3 conditions (standard knee sleeve, no device and distal thigh compression garment (DTCG)).The hypothesis was that the DTCG group would display superior dynamic knee valgus FPPA compared to the standard knee sleeve and no device groups.Methods.Eighteen healthy college athletes participated in this prospective cohort study with a randomized device order.FPPA was measured during SLFHS using two-dimensional biomechanical techniques to estimate dynamic knee valgus loading.A 10-cm visual analog scale survey collected data regarding subject perceived knee control, sports movement capability and overall satisfaction for each condition.Pearson correlations delineated knee valgus, safety and performance relationship perceptions (p < 0.05).Results.Mean/maximum dynamic knee valgus FPPA was lowest during the DTCG condition (8.7 ± 6°/12.2 ± 7°), or a 19.4%/21.3%range of motion reduction compared to the standard knee sleeve (10.8 ± 7°/15.5 ± 8°) and a 21.6%/17% reduction compared to the no device (11.1 ± 7°/14.7 ± 7°) conditions.Chi-square tests revealed that the T:25 group displayed a greater proportion of subjects with a ""1"" score (≤threshold value) than the standard knee brace or no device groups for both mean (one-sided p value = 0.02) and maximal (one-side p value = 0.049 FPPA).In relationship to maximum dynamic knee valgus FPPA, the DTCG was the best overall condition (r = 0.61, p = 0.007), relating more strongly to perceived knee control (r = 0.63, p = 0.005) and sports movement capability (r = 0.64, p = 0.004).Conclusions.Compared to standard knee sleeve and no knee device conditions, the T:25 device provided better dynamic knee valgus FPPA control and stronger subject perceptions of best overall condition, knee control and sports movement capability.","This study evaluates the effectiveness of a distal thigh compression garment (DTCG) on knee control and athletes’ perceptions of safety and performance in female athletes during a single leg forward hop. The findings indicate that the DTCG significantly reduces dynamic knee valgus projection compared to standard knee sleeves and no device, while also enhancing perceived knee control and sports movement capability."
BIOMECHANICAL STUDY OF MUSCLE MOVEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF FOOTBALL TECHNICAL TRAINING,2020-03-01,,,,"Study of biomechanical characteristics of muscles can provide an effective reference for the training of athletes. Football is a vigorous sport, and physical collision and damage are frequent during competition and training. In order to improve football skills and prevent sports injuries, 10 athletes from Sport College of Shaoyang University, Hunan, China, were tested for isokinetic muscle strength. The moment of flexors and extensors was measured when the flexion and extension angular speed of hip and knee joints was 50 ∘ , 100 ∘ , 150 ∘ , 200 ∘ , 250 ∘ , 300 ∘ , 350 ∘ and 400 ∘ , respectively. Moreover the characteristics of force moment of flexor and extensor were verified by testing the electromyographic signal of the flexor and extensor of the hip and knee joints with isokinetic concentric exercise using piezoelectric sensor. The results showed that the electromyographic signal of the flexor and extensor of the hip and knee joint decreased with the increase of angular velocity of isokinetic concentric exercise; the electromyographic signal obtained by the piezoelectric sensor verified the law that the output of the flexor and extensor decreased, the extensor of the hip joint had incoordination during rapid movement, and the output of the extensor was always larger than that of the flexor no matter how fast the extensor moved.","This paper investigates the biomechanical characteristics of muscle movement during football technical training, particularly focusing on the isokinetic muscle strength of athletes. Key findings indicate that as angular velocity increases, the electromyographic signals of flexor and extensor muscles in the hip and knee joints decrease, highlighting the coordination issues of hip extensors during rapid movements."
"Angular Velocity, Moment, and Power Analysis of the Ankle, Knee, and Hip Joints in the Goalkeeper's Diving Save in Football",2020-02-28,,,,"The aim of this study was to identify biomechanical characteristics of goalkeeper's diving performance in football. Lower extremity joints powers, moments and angular velocities, were investigated in seven elite goalkeepers diving to save balls, shot from a ball canon to unanticipated heights (high and low) and sides (right and left). Our result showed that there was a proximal-to-distal sequence for each leg in timing of peak joints powers (p<0.05). Hip extensors produced the largest (p<0.05) peak moment, the contralateral (relative to dive side) peak was significantly larger than the ipsilateral one for high (4.56 ±1.02 N·m·kg-1, and 3.52 ±0.79 N·m·kg-1) and low dives (3.52 ±0.79 N·m·kg-1, and 2.52 ±0.56 N·m·kg-1). The ankle plantar flexors produced the second largest peak moment (p<0.05), and the peak ipsilateral ankle power and angular velocity were the largest (p<0.05) of all joints, during high (1502 ±338 W, and 14.73 ±1.36 rad·s-1) and low dives (868 ±263 W, and 14.14 ±3.09 rad·s-1). Strength and conditioning coaches need to focus on hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors, and for specificity in power training that should elicit triple extension of the lower limbs' joints in a proximal-to-distal sequence.","This study investigates the biomechanical characteristics of goalkeepers’ diving performances in football by analyzing the angular velocity, moment, and power of the ankle, knee, and hip joints during saves. Key findings indicate a proximal-to-distal timing sequence in joint power, with hip extensors generating the largest moments and a significant emphasis on the role of ankle plantar flexors in high and low dives, highlighting essential areas for strength and conditioning focus in training."
Height After Side: Goalkeepers Detect the Vertical Direction of Association-Football Penalty Kicks From the Ball Trajectory,2020-02-27,,,,"The present research analyzes the relation between the height of penalty kicks in association football and (a) the probability that goalkeepers stop the ball, (b) the kinematics of the kicker, and (c) the movements of the goalkeeper. We re-analyzed movement registration data that were collected in an experiment (with professional and semi-professional players) that focused on the horizontal direction of the penalties (Lopes et al., 2014). We also digitized and analyzed regular videos of the goalkeepers that were recorded by Lopes et al. (2014) but not analyzed. The present research complements the current understanding of the penalty kick with three main observations. First, goalkeepers save penalties at middle heights more often than low and high penalties. Second, the height of penalties is predicted less clearly than their horizontal direction from the kinematics of penalty takers. Third, goalkeepers tend to initiate the horizontal component of the saving action before the penalty taker contacts the ball, but they initiate the vertical component of the action about 245 ms after the contact. Taken together, these results support the view that goalkeepers make the left-right decision at least partly focusing on the kinematics of the kicker, and that they dynamically decide the vertical aspects of the movement later, focusing on the ball trajectory.","This paper investigates how the height of penalty kicks in football influences the goalkeepers' ability to save them, considering factors such as the kinematics of the kicker and goalkeeper movements. The key findings reveal that goalkeepers are more successful at saving shots aimed at middle heights, rely on the kicker's motions for horizontal decisions, and delay their vertical response relative to the ball's trajectory."
ACL Injury Prediction in Footballers Using Landing Error Scoring System (LESS),2020-02-27,,,,"Background: The use of clinical field assessment tools is popular in sports rehabilitation settings. The purpose of these tools is not only prediction of injury but also to assist in development of injury prevention programs. Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) is a clinical tool that evaluates biomechanical performance during a jump-landing task with particular focus on aspects related to an increased risk for ACL injury. Objective: Of this study was to find the most common faulty biomechanics in football players. Method: This is an evaluation-based study which predicts the risk of ACL injuries in 30 football players based on their jump landing mechanics. This evaluation was carried out with the help of software Kinovea that helps in analysis of joint kinematics. The data captured with the help of off-the-shelf cameras in frontal and sagittal planes and analysed. The frequency of common errors was identified. Result: It was found out that 20% of the players had poor landing mechanics having maximum errors, 20% had moderate errors, while 13% had good score and 47% had excellent landing mechanics. The most common error was knee valgus at initial contact, stance width wider and knee valgus displacement. Conclusion: LESS is beneficial in identification of faulty biomechanics. LESS when used along with Kinovea helps analyse common jump landing errors. Knee valgus along with internal rotation of tibia was found to be the common error which predisposes footballers to ACL injury.","This paper investigates the use of the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) to predict ACL injury risks in football players by evaluating their jump-landing biomechanics. The study identifies common faulty mechanics, with knee valgus being the most prevalent error, and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LESS with Kinovea software for analyzing joint kinematics during the jump-landing task."
Effect of Forefoot and Midfoot Bending Stiffness on Agility Performance and Foot Biomechanics in Soccer,2020-02-26,,,,"Footwear bending stiffness is known to positively affect performance in agility maneuvers due to improved energy storage and propulsion based on a stiffer foot-shoe complex. However, the functional properties of the forefoot and midfoot differ. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of the interface of longitudinal bending stiffness and the ratio of forefoot to midfoot bending stiffness on agility performance and foot biomechanics. A total of 18 male soccer players performed 2 agility tasks in footwear conditions that were systematically modified in forefoot and midfoot bending stiffness. Results revealed that higher longitudinal bending stiffness caused more foot exorotation at the initial ground contact (P < .05), less torsion (P < .001), and an anterior shift in the point of force application during push off (P = .01). In addition, the authors observed decreased forefoot bending (P < .05) and increased torsion (P < .01) in footwear with a higher forefoot-midfoot ratio. Finally, the agility performance was significantly impaired by 1.3% in the condition with the highest forefoot-midfoot ratio (P < .01). The high forefoot-midfoot ratio, that is, a stiff forefoot in combination with a soft midfoot, seemed to shift the flex line from anterior to posterior that may explain the performance impairment.","This paper investigates the impact of forefoot and midfoot bending stiffness on agility performance and foot biomechanics in soccer players. It finds that higher longitudinal bending stiffness improves foot mechanics during agility tasks, but an increased forefoot-midfoot stiffness ratio can impair agility performance and alter force application dynamics."
Isolated Avulsion of the Biceps Femoris Insertion: A Case Report and Literature Review,2020-02-25,,,,"Isolated avulsion of distal biceps femoris tendon is a rare occurrence. We report a case of a 34-year-old football coach with isolated avulsion of distal biceps tendon which occurred while kicking a ball backwards with his heel. He underwent surgical treatment and recovered fully. We obtained an MRI scan 22 months postoperative and found good tendon to bone healing. In reviewing other literature of similar injuries, we found 23 reported cases in 11 publications. 21 of the 24 cases (including our reported case) injured the tendon in a sporting activity. 21 cases underwent surgical treatment while 3 took conservative treatment. Both methods of treatment resulted in a good clinical outcome. Most of the cases were able to return to pre-injury level of sports. Any advantages of one method of treatment over the other could not be determined.","The paper discusses a rare case of isolated avulsion of the distal biceps femoris tendon in a football coach, detailing the injury's occurrence during a specific action in the sport. It presents a review of the literature on similar cases, noting that surgical and conservative treatments both led to good clinical outcomes, allowing most athletes to return to their previous level of activity."

The generalization of scientists and practitioners on the problem of formation of volitional qualities of cadet student youth by means of football is generalized. Based on a four-stage procedural scheme of adolescent personality convergence developed by I. Beh and refined by N. Kasich, we characterized the criteria and indicators of the formation of volitional qualities of cadets and students by means of football, namely: cognitive (awareness of the quality of awareness). qualities; understanding of the importance of active student-student youth as opposed to passive in the process of achieving the goal by football; knowledge of student-student youth responsibilities and their performance in the training process in football); emotional value (interest in playing football, sports history of Ukraine, sports traditions of higher education institutions; joyful experience of cadet student youth from the process of reaching the goal by means of football; desire to participate in training and competitions in football; willingness to be ready (willingness to important personality qualities; spiritual determination in the process of formation of volitional qualities; volitional desire to participate in training and competitions in football; activity-practical (ability to manifest volitional qualities to be purposeful in the process of playing football; to participate in training and competitions in football and to reach the end goal by showing responsibility for oneself and to the sports team;The pedagogical conditions, content and methods of formation of volitional qualities of cadets and students in the course of football are covered.

Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury and its Prevention,2020-02-17,,,,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of major risks for most athletes. ACL injury can be caused by many risk factors such as anatomic risk factors, biomechanical risk factors and environmental risk factors. In this article, numerical and theoretical analysis are conducted to investigate biomechanical risk factors. An entire three-dimensional finite element knee model was built based on MRI data. Anterior Tibial Translations (ATT) at different knee flexion angles are simulated by finite element models. In the simulations, more attentions are given to material properties of different knee components and their effects on ACL injury. Mechanical response of ACL during sport activities is highly determined by its viscoelastic properties. Unfortunately, viscoelastic properties of two bundles of ACL will change dramatically even with several hours’ physical aging. As a consequence, ACL will experience mechanical ductile to brittle transition due to daily physical aging. Theory of physical aging from polymer science is, for the first time, introduced to understand ACL injury and its prevention. By analogy to physical aging of amorphous polymer materials, we think physical aging of two bundles of ACL will largely increase risk of ACL injury. Besides, physical aging will also build a heterogeneous stress and strain in ACL due to its natural anatomic structure, which is a large risk for athletes. The specific designed prevention programs for ACL injury such as plyometrics, strengthening and other neuromuscular training exercises [1] are believed to erase physical aging of ACL. ACL with less physical aging is less likely to get injured in sport activities. In this article, a virtual physical aging simulation is built to validate current hypothesis. Erasing physical aging of ACL may provide an accurate and quantitative way to prevent ACL injury.","This paper investigates the biomechanical risk factors associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in athletes, utilizing theoretical and numerical analyses through a finite element knee model based on MRI data. It emphasizes the impact of physical aging on the viscoelastic properties of the ACL and proposes targeted prevention programs to mitigate injury risks related to this aging process."
Real‐time biofeedback integrated into neuromuscular training reduces high‐risk knee biomechanics and increases functional brain connectivity: A preliminary longitudinal investigation,2020-02-13,,,,"Abstract Prospective evidence indicates that functional biomechanics and brain connectivity may predispose an athlete to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, revealing novel neural linkages for targeted neuromuscular training interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a real‐time biofeedback system for altering knee biomechanics and brain functional connectivity. Seventeen healthy, young, physically active female athletes completed 6 weeks of augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) utilizing real‐time, interactive visual biofeedback and 13 served as untrained controls. A drop vertical jump and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging were separately completed at pre‐ and posttest time points to assess sensorimotor adaptation. The aNMT group had a significant reduction in peak knee abduction moment (pKAM) compared to controls ( p = .03, d = 0.71). The aNMT group also exhibited a significant increase in functional connectivity between the right supplementary motor area and the left thalamus ( p = .0473 after false discovery rate correction). Greater percent change in pKAM was also related to increased connectivity between the right cerebellum and right thalamus for the aNMT group ( p = .0292 after false discovery rate correction, r 2 = .62). No significant changes were observed for the controls ( p s &gt; .05). Our data provide preliminary evidence of potential neural mechanisms for aNMT‐induced motor adaptations that reduce injury risk. Future research is warranted to understand the role of neuromuscular training alone and how each component of aNMT influences biomechanics and functional connectivity.","This paper investigates the efficacy of real-time biofeedback integrated into augmented neuromuscular training to alter knee biomechanics and enhance brain functional connectivity, with a focus on reducing risk for anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The findings indicate significant improvements in peak knee abduction moment and functional connectivity among athletes undergoing the training compared to a control group, suggesting novel neural mechanisms associated with neuromuscular training interventions."
The effect of low back pain and lower limb injury on lumbar multifidus muscle morphology and function in university soccer players,2020-02-12,,,,"Abstract Background The lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM) plays a critical role to stabilize the spine. While low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint in soccer players, few studies have examined LMM characteristics in this athletic population and their possible associations with LBP and lower limb injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) investigate LMM characteristics in university soccer players and their potential association with LBP and lower limb injury; 2) examine the relationship between LMM characteristics and body composition measurements; and 3) examine seasonal changes in LMM characteristics. Methods LMM ultrasound assessments were acquired in 27 soccer players (12 females, 15 males) from Concordia University during the preseason and assessments were repeated in 18 players at the end of the season. LMM cross-sectional area (CSA), echo-intensity and thickness at rest and during contraction (e.g. function) were assessed bilaterally in prone and standing positions, at the L5-S1 spinal level. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess the history of LBP and lower limb injury. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to acquire body composition measurements. Results Side-to-side asymmetry of the LMM was significantly greater in males ( p = 0.02). LMM thickness when contracted in the prone position ( p = 0.04) and LMM CSA in standing ( p = 0.02) were also significantly greater on the left side in male players. The LMM % thickness change during contraction in the prone position was significantly greater in players who reported having LBP in the previous 3-months ( p &lt; 0.001). LMM CSA (r = − 0.41, p = 0.01) and echo-intensity ( r = 0.69, p &lt; 0.001) were positively correlated to total % body fat. There was a small decrease in LMM thickness at rest in the prone position over the course of the season ( p = 0.03). Conclusions The greater LMM contraction in players with LBP may be a maladaptive strategy to splint and project the spine. LMM morphology measurements were correlated to body composition. The results provide new insights with regards to LMM morphology and activation in soccer players and their associations with injury and body composition measurements.","This paper investigates the characteristics of the lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM) in university soccer players and its associations with low back pain (LBP) and lower limb injuries. Key findings include significant side-to-side asymmetry in LMM morphology, greater muscle contraction in players with LBP, and correlations between LMM characteristics and body composition, providing insights into the LMM's role in injury and performance."
Biomechanical and Physiological Responses to 120 Min. of Soccer-Specific Exercise,2020-02-05,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate biomechanical and physiological responses to soccer-specific exercise incorporating an extra-time period (ET) and assess the test–retest reliability of these responses. Methods: Twelve soccer players performed 120 min of soccer-specific exercise. Tri-axial (PLTotal) and uni-axial PlayerLoad™ in the vertical (PLV), anterior–posterior (PLA–P), and medial–lateral (PLM–L) planes were monitored using a portable accelerometer. Likewise, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was recorded throughout exercise. At the end of each 15-min period, players provided differential ratings of perceived exertion for legs (RPE-L), breathlessness (RPE-B) and overall (RPE-O), and capillary samples were taken to measure blood lactate (BLa) concentrations. The soccer-specific exercise was completed twice within 7 days to assess reliability. Results: A main effect for time was identified for PLTotal (p = 0.045), PLV (p = 0.002), PLA–P (p = 0.011), RER (p = 0.001), RPE-L (p = 0.001), RPE-O (p = 0.003), and CMJ (p = 0.020). A significant increase in PLTotal (234 ± 34 au) and decrease in RER (0.87 ± 0.03) was evident during 105–120 versus 0–15 min (215 ± 25 au; p = 0.002 and 0.92 ± 0.02; p = 0.001). Coefficients of variations were <10% and Pearson's correlation coefficient demonstrated moderate-to-very strong (0.33–0.99) reliability for all PL variables, RPE-B, BLa, and RER. Conclusions: These results suggest that mechanical efficiency is compromised and an increased rate of lipolysis is observed as a function of exercise duration, particularly during ET. These data have implications for practitioners interested in fatigue-induced changes during ET.","This study investigates the biomechanical and physiological responses of soccer players during 120 minutes of soccer-specific exercise, focusing on the effects of an extra-time period. Key findings demonstrate that mechanical efficiency declines and lipolysis rates increase as exercise duration extends, alongside a thorough analysis of perceived exertion and physiological markers like blood lactate and respiratory exchange ratio."
Evaluation of the Pre-Planned and Non-Planed Agility Performance: Comparison between Individual and Team Sports,2020-02-04,,,,"This study assessed differences in agility performance between athletes of team and individual sports by assessing change-of-direction speed (CODS) as pre-planned agility and reactive agility (RA) as non-planed in different spatial configurations. The study involved 36 individual (sprint, hurdles, jumping, tennis, and judo) and 34 team (soccer, basketball, and handball) athletes. CODS and RA were measured with a light-based reactive training system in a frontal (FR), universal (UN), semicircular (SC), and lateral (LA) design. Lower limb power and sprint performance were also measured in a 10 m single leg jump test and 15 m sprint. Individual athletes showed significantly better performance in three of the eight agility tests: LA-RA, UN-RA, and SC-CODS (p < 0.008, p < 0.036, and p < 0.027, respectively) and were found to present stronger correlations (p < 0.01) between jump test performance and the CODS condition. Team athletes showed stronger associations between sprint performance and the CODS condition. In the RA condition both jump and sprint performance showed stronger correlations in the group of individual athletes. Agility performance as measured by CODS and RA should improve with enhanced of motor proficiency. Finally, the tests applied in this experiment seem to be multidimensional, but require spatio-temporal adjustment for their implementation, so that they meet the requirements of the particular sport.","This study compares agility performance in change-of-direction speed (CODS) and reactive agility (RA) between athletes from individual sports and team sports using a light-based reactive training system. Key findings indicate that individual athletes performed better in specific agility tests and showed stronger correlations between agility and lower limb power, while team athletes exhibited stronger associations between sprint performance and CODS."
Uncovering EEG Correlates of Covert Attention in Soccer Goalkeepers: Towards Innovative Sport Training Procedures,2020-02-03,,,,"Abstract Advances in sports sciences and neurosciences offer new opportunities to design efficient and motivating sport training tools. For instance, using NeuroFeedback (NF), athletes can learn to self-regulate specific brain rhythms and consequently improve their performances. Here, we focused on soccer goalkeepers’ Covert Visual Spatial Attention (CVSA) abilities, which are essential for these athletes to reach high performances. We looked for Electroencephalography (EEG) markers of CVSA usable for virtual reality-based NF training procedures, i.e., markers that comply with the following criteria: (1) specific to CVSA, (2) detectable in real-time and (3) related to goalkeepers’ performance/expertise. Our results revealed that the best-known EEG marker of CVSA—increased α -power ipsilateral to the attended hemi-field— was not usable since it did not comply with criteria 2 and 3. Nonetheless, we highlighted a significant positive correlation between athletes’ improvement in CVSA abilities and the increase of their α -power at rest. While the specificity of this marker remains to be demonstrated, it complied with both criteria 2 and 3. This result suggests that it may be possible to design innovative ecological training procedures for goalkeepers, for instance using a combination of NF and cognitive tasks performed in virtual reality.","This paper investigates the relationship between Electroencephalography (EEG) markers and Covert Visual Spatial Attention (CVSA) in soccer goalkeepers to enhance training methodologies. The study identifies a correlation between goalkeepers' CVSA improvement and increased α-power at rest, suggesting a potential for innovative training tools that integrate NeuroFeedback and virtual reality techniques."
Validity and Reliability of a Test Battery to Assess Change of Directions with Ball Dribbling in Para-footballers with Cerebral Palsy,2020-01-31,,,,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the content and construct validity and between-sessions reliability of four agility tests requiring ball dribbling in football players with cerebral palsy (CP) with implications for classification and training. A sample of 35 football players with CP from three different countries took part in the study. They performed four tests in two sessions 72 h apart: i) 20 m in a straight line, ii) forward slalom with short changes of direction, iii) forward slalom with wide changes of direction and iv) square course. The Kappa coefficient was used to test content validity, obtaining moderate to almost perfect agreement results. Construct validity was also demonstrated with very large to almost perfect correlations between tests and sessions. Good reliability was found using intra-class coefficients (&gt;0.86), standard error of measurement (&lt;10.8%) and Cronbach´s alpha (&gt;0.86). The comparisons between CP profiles (i.e. sport classes) demonstrated that those with mild impairment performed faster, and those with impairment of ataxia and dyskinesia performed worse. The four tests could have applications in classification, but may also be applied by the CP football coaches to improve athlete agility and football skills.","This paper evaluates the validity and reliability of a test battery designed to assess agility with ball dribbling in football players with cerebral palsy (CP). It demonstrates that the tests provide good content and construct validity, as well as high reliability, and highlights their potential for classification and training applications in CP football."
Alternative shoe closure designs alter biomechanical performance during agility-based movements,2020-01-28,,,,"The objective of this research was to determine if three alternative shoe upper closures improve biomechanical performance measures relative to a standard lace closure in court-based movements. NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four court-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Strap. Ground contact time, peak eccentric rate of force development (RFD), peak concentric GRF, peak concentric COM power, eccentric work, concentric work, and movement completion time were measured. Tri Strap saw improvements in four of seven biomechanical variables during CMJ and LSJ and one variable during TDS. Lace Replacement delivered improvements in one performance measure during CMJ, LSJ, and AP, and two variables in TDS. Y Wrap improved performance in three performance measures during LSJ and impaired performance in two measures during CMJ and three measures during AP. Tri Strap provided the most consistent performance improvements across all movements. This study allowed for the mechanical properties of the shoe lower to remain consistent across designs to examine if an alternative shoe upper closure could enhance performance. Our results indicate that increased proprioception and/or mechanical properties due to the alternative closures, especially Tri Strap, improves athlete performance, which concludes that the design of the shoe upper is an essential consideration in shoe design.","This paper investigates the impact of three alternative shoe upper closures on biomechanical performance during agility-based movements in court sports. The findings reveal that the Tri Strap closure consistently enhances performance metrics, while Lace Replacement and Y Wrap exhibit mixed effects, emphasizing the significance of shoe upper design in enhancing athletic performance."
Train Like You Compete? Physical and Physiological Responses on Semi-Professional Soccer Players,2020-01-24,,,,"Background: Decision-making in soccer has repercussions and depends on the environment of training or competition. The demands on the players can reveal if the decision-making is similar or different from that required during competition. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the physical and physiological responses of players in training matches (TM) and official competition matches (CM) according to the playing position (external defenders, internal defenders, midfielders, and forwards/extremes). Methods: Twenty semi-professional male soccer players and 10 CM (n = 40) and 10 TM (n = 40) were studied using global positioning system technology, and paired and one-way ANOVA tests were carried out to compare physical (distances and number of sprints) and physiological (heart rates) responses with the factors a) match environments (TM and CM) and b) the playing position, respectively. Results: The results revealed that during CM, players covered higher total distance, partial distances, and sprints at different speeds (0–21 km/h) and produced higher physiological responses. Midfielders covered the greatest total distance in both TM (7227.6 m) and CM (11,225.9 m), in comparison to the other playing positions. However, forwards and extremes spent more time (56.8% of the CM [d = 0.78]) at 76% to 84% of their maximal heart rates. Conclusions: First, the physical and physiological responses in TM were significantly lower than in CM. Second, these responses were different according to the playing position, so this study was able to verify the exact amount of variation between the load produced in TM and CM. These results will help the coach and technical staff to design training tasks to complement the responses found in TM.","This study examines the physical and physiological responses of semi-professional soccer players during training matches compared to official competition matches, focusing on variations by playing position. The findings indicate that players exhibit higher physical performance and physiological responses in competition, particularly midfielders, which can inform coaching practices for more effective training."
Relationships between Body Build and Knee Joint Flexor and Extensor Torque of Polish First-Division Soccer Players,2020-01-22,,,,"The aim of the study is to identify the relationships between anthropometric variables and knee joint extensor peak torque, knee joint flexor peak torque, and conventional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio in Polish first-division soccer players. The study examined 37 soccer players aged 19 to 30 years (body mass: 76.8 ± 7.2 kg, body height 1.82 ± 0.06 m). Muscle torques of the knee joint were measured under isometric conditions using a Biodex 4 Pro dynamometer. The anthropometric variables such as body part lengths, breadths, and girths and skinfold thickness were measured. The strongest relationships of knee joint extensors were observed with body mass and variables describing skeleton size and lower-limb muscles. Regarding knee flexor torque, a significant relationship was found only with body mass. However, no significant relationships were observed between the conventional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio and the anthropometric variables studied. The regression analysis results identified body height, body mass, and thigh and calf girth as the features most associated with knee joint torque. However, anthropometric measurements do not provide full information about the torque proportions of antagonist muscle groups, which is very important for injury prevention. Therefore, measurements using special biomechanical equipment are also necessary for the comprehensive analyses and control of the effects of sports training.","This study investigates the relationship between anthropometric variables and knee joint torque in Polish first-division soccer players, specifically focusing on extensor and flexor peak torque. Key findings indicate that body mass, height, and lower limb girth significantly correlate with knee joint torque, while emphasizing the need for biomechanical measurements alongside anthropometric data for better injury prevention insights."
Professional assessment of potential concussions in elite football tournaments,2020-01-15,,,,"Potential concussive events (PCEs) are a major health concern in football. Though there are protocols set in place for assessments of PCEs, there has been no evidence of adherence in major football tournaments.Our research goal is to determine if PCEs in elite football are professionally assessed according to the International Conference on Concussion in Sport (ICCS) consensus statement recommendations. Identification and analysis of PCEs in the 2018 World Cup (WC) were accomplished through standardised observation of video footage by trained observers. Results were contrasted with data from the 2014 WC and 2016 Euro Cup. Our primary outcomes include frequency and professional assessment of PCEs, signs of concussions and time stopped for assessments.In the 64 games of the 2018 WC, 87 PCEs (1.36 per game) were identified. Thirty-one (35.6%) PCEs were professionally assessed, resulting in the removal of three (3.5%) players from the match. Six (6.9%) PCEs showed one sign of concussion, 60 (69.0%) showed two signs, 20 (23.0%) showed three signs and 1 (1.2%) showed four or more signs. The mean time stopped for assessment was 63.3 s. No significant change in the percentage of professional assessments (mean=33.4%, 95% CI 20.7% to 46.1%) were identified across tournaments (p=0.42).These findings demonstrate a need for adherence to concussion protocols in order to improve the brain-health of athletes. Proper enforcement of the ICCS protocols during these tournaments and promoting player health and safety can influence the officiating, coaching and playing of football worldwide by promoting player safety.","The paper examines the assessment of potential concussive events (PCEs) in elite football tournaments, specifically focusing on adherence to the International Conference on Concussion in Sport (ICCS) guidelines. The study found that only 35.6% of identified PCEs were professionally assessed during the 2018 World Cup, indicating a persistent need for improved compliance with concussion protocols to enhance athlete safety."
Influence of a Field Hamstring Eccentric Training on Muscle Strength and Flexibility,2020-01-14,,,,"Abstract Muscle strength imbalances and poor flexibility are frequently described as risk factors for hamstring injury. Preventive strategies include eccentric exercises, but the influence of field eccentric exercises on these risk factors remains unclear. We investigated the influence of a field hamstring eccentric program on hamstring strength and flexibility. Twenty-seven amateur athletes were randomly assigned to an intervention (n=13) or control group (n=14). In the intervention group, participants were involved in 15 sessions of four eccentric exercises. Peak torque, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios, passive and active flexibility were analyzed. No significant modifications of strength, passive or active flexibility were observed in the control group (p&gt;0.05). Hamstring eccentric peak torque (+7.1%) and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios (9.3%) were significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) in the intervention group, but not concentric strength (p&lt;0.05). Passive straight leg raise was significantly increased by 11.4° (+12.7%, p&lt;0.001), but not active flexibility (+3.1%, p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, a 6-week eccentric program, including four field exercises for hamstring muscles, is an effective method of improving eccentric strength, functional ratios and, especially, passive flexibility. As this program may be easily implemented in a real-world context, this association of multiple eccentric exercises might be useful in an injury prevention strategy.","This paper investigates the effects of a field-based eccentric training program on hamstring strength and flexibility in amateur athletes. It finds that such a program significantly enhances eccentric peak torque and passive flexibility, suggesting its potential as a practical injury prevention strategy."

Measuring biomechanical loads in team sports – from lab to field,2020-01-08,,,,"The benefits of differentiating between the physiological and biomechanical load-response pathways in football and other (team) sports have become increasingly recognised. In contrast to physiological loads however, the biomechanical demands of training and competition are still not well understood, primarily due to the difficulty of quantifying biomechanical loads in a field environment. Although musculoskeletal adaptation and injury are known to occur at a tissue level, several biomechanical load metrics are available that quantify loads experienced by the body as a whole, its different structures and the individual tissues that are part of these structures. This paper discusses the distinct aspects and challenges that are associated with measuring biomechanical loads at these different levels in laboratory and/or field contexts. Our hope is that through this paper, sport scientists and practitioners will be able to critically consider the value and limitations of biomechanical load metrics and will keep pursuing new methods to measure these loads within and outside the lab, as a detailed load quantification is essential to better understand the biomechanical load-response pathways that occur in the field.","This paper explores the challenges of measuring biomechanical loads in team sports, particularly football, and highlights the distinction between physiological and biomechanical load-response pathways. It emphasizes the importance of accurately quantifying these loads in both laboratory and field settings to enhance understanding of musculoskeletal adaptation and injury prevention."
Osteochondral avulsion fracture of the posteromedial tibial plateau,2020-01-08,,,,"Posteromedial tibial plateau avulsion fracture caused by semimembranosus muscle is not easy to detect by X-ray.The literature regarding this issue is poor, also mechanism is extensively disputable.This lesion was often connected to an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and medial meniscal horn lesion.In this work, we described a posteromedial tibial plateau avulsion fracture at the semimembranosus insertion.In particular, we referred to the surgical treatment of those transversal osteochondral fractures. Clinical caseA 23 years old male reported a knee injury while was playing soccer.The traumatic mechanism was due to a collision with another player during a change of direction.The patient arrived at the emergency room walking with an antalgic gait and a crutch the day after the injury.ROM of the knee was limited in flexion and extension both actively and passively with a Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale of 25.At the physical examination he presented a swelling of the knee and a severe and permanent pain during weightbearing, on the affected leg.Moreover, he reported knee instability with episodic ROM gap when trying to improve flexion.He couldn't use stairs and perform movements like squat, ROM was 10°-80°with negative instability tests.X-ray evaluations presented a posteromedial tibial plateau fracture with a disruption of a bone portion (Fig. 1A,B,C) in association with an anteromedial detachment of a bony fragment.A three-dimensional CT scan was realized to define the exact position and dimension of the fragment that was rotated at 90°in the sagittal plane with the articular surface oriented anteriorly (Figs.2,3).An MRI exam was not performed in reason of a possible overestimation of the fragment, as confirmed by literature, even if this analysis might have given more information about muscle relationships and ligament conditions [1].","This paper discusses a unique case of a posteromedial tibial plateau avulsion fracture linked to the semimembranosus muscle, which is often misdiagnosed due to its subtle appearance on X-ray. It emphasizes the surgical treatment of such injuries, reports on the injury mechanism during a soccer game, and highlights the clinical findings, including limited range of motion and knee instability."

Protocol for a participant‐ and assessor‐blinded, randomised, parallel group feasibility trial of foot orthoses for adolescents with patellofemoral pain",2020-01-01,,,,"Abstract Background Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common cause of knee pain in adolescents, but there are limited evidence‐based treatment options for this population. Foot orthoses can improve pain and function in adults with PFP, and may be effective for adolescents. The primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a full‐scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of contoured foot orthoses on knee pain severity and patient‐perceived global change, compared to flat shoe insoles, in adolescents with PFP. The secondary aim is to provide an estimate of treatment effects for foot orthoses, compared to flat insoles, in adolescents with PFP. Methods This randomised, controlled, participant‐ and assessor‐blinded, feasibility trial has two parallel groups. Forty adolescents (aged 12–18 years) with clinical symptoms of PFP will be recruited from Queensland, Australia. Participants will be randomised to receive either prefabricated contoured foot orthoses or flat shoe insoles. Both interventions will be fit by a physiotherapist, and worn for 3 months. Feasibility will be evaluated through assessing willingness of volunteers to enrol, number of eligible participants, recruitment rate, adherence with the study protocol, adverse effects, success of blinding, and drop‐out rate. Secondary outcomes will evaluate knee‐related pain, symptoms, function, quality of life, global rating of change, patient acceptable symptom state, and use of co‐interventions, at 6 weeks and 3 months. Primary outcomes will be reported descriptively, while estimates of standard deviation and between‐group differences (with 95% confidence intervals) will be reported for secondary outcomes. Discussion Findings of this study will inform the feasibility of a full‐scale RCT investigating the efficacy of contoured foot orthoses in adolescents with PFP. This full‐scale study is necessary to improve the evidence base for management of adolescent PFP, and enhance outcomes for this population.

Electromyographic activity of quadriceps and hamstrings of a professional football team during Bulgarian Squat and Lunge exercises,2020-01-01,,,,"The aim of this study was to analyse the quadriceps-hamstring coactivation in the lunge and Bulgarian squat exercises.A cross-sectional study design was applied to seventeen healthy professional football players.Muscular activity was measured using wireless surface electromyography (sEMG).The Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction was used to normalize the data.The muscle activation of each muscle belly was significantly different between the two exercises (F4.24 = 28.076,p < .001,partial ƞ 2 = .72).Activity in individual muscles varied in both the lunge (F4,24 = 49.315,p < .001,partialƞ 2 = .89),and the Bulgarian squat (F4,24 = 28,076, p < .001,partialƞ 2 = .82).The results showed no significant differences between the preferred and non-preferred legs of the participants (p > .05).In both the lunge and the Bulgarian squat, a significantly greater activation of the vastus medialis (VM) and the vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were found compared to the rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST).Muscles showed a greater activation during the Bulgarian squat compared to the lunge, but the hamstrings to quadriceps ratio was similar in both exercises (p > .05).The present work shows that the Bulgarian Squat exercise produces greater muscle activation than the Lunge exercise, whereas in both exercises there is a similar pattern of muscle activation.No differences were found between legs.If one wants to work specifically on strength development, the Bulgarian Squat would be a better option, as would be the case if one were to focus on synergistic work on the quadriceps and hamstrings, as the Bulgarian Squat exercise shows a higher H:Q ratio.","The paper investigates quadriceps-hamstring coactivation during Bulgarian squat and lunge exercises in professional football players using surface electromyography. It concludes that the Bulgarian squat elicits greater muscle activation compared to the lunge, with a similar muscle activation pattern and Hamstrings to Quadriceps (H:Q) ratio in both exercises, suggesting the Bulgarian squat is more effective for strength development."
Functional Ankle Instability Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors in Male Football Players,2020-01-01,,,,"Background: The injuries sustained in football most frequently occur to the lower extremity, with ankle and knee being the most affected joint segments. Many studies have defined ankle sprain as one of the most common sports injuries with an annual incidence rate of 15% to 45%, however, there's a lack of studies in football regional leagues. Risk factors like anthropometric measures, field position, dominant limb, previous injury have been described as being associated with ankle injuries in the elite sports context. The primary aim of this study was to determine prevalence rates of self-reported ankle instability in regional leagues. A secondary aim was to explore the presence of extrinsic factors affecting ankle instability in these football players. Methods: The heads of all clubs (n = 66) from Coimbra and Aveiro (Portugal) regional male senior football divisions during season 2016/2017 were contacted by e-mail or telephone to enter the study, and 58 gave their permission to include their athletes. Then, all players from each of these 58 teams were invited to enter the study (n = 1044) and a total of 589 athletes participated. Demographic and anthropometric data were recorded concerning age, height, weight, years of training, mean number of training hours, position in camp along with specific questions related to an ankle injury. All participants were asked about their previous history of injury, reinjury, feeling of giving-away and where also asked to fill the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool. Results: A total of 290 (49.2%) athletes reported a history of at least one previous sprain and, from these, 170 (58.6%) repeated the injury and 112 (19%) reported sensation of ""giving-away"". A significant association was found between injury, recurrence and subjective feeling of giving away (p < 0.05). The player field's position was found to be associated with ankle instability, with defenders and forwards having higher rates of self-reported instability. No other significant associations were found. Conclusion: Along with intrinsic factors (age and injury repetition), some extrinsic factors were found to be associated with instability rates in professional regional football players (exposure time, and position on the field) suggesting the need for specific prevention strategies.","This paper investigates the prevalence of functional ankle instability and associated risk factors among male football players in regional leagues. It finds that nearly half of the participating athletes reported a history of ankle sprains, with key associations identified between player position and ankle instability, highlighting the importance of tailored prevention strategies for injury management."
The effect of different sports specialization on ankle joint mobility of young players,2020-01-01,,,,"The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of practicing different sports on ankle joint mobility (AJM) in young subjects.In 344 players of 5 different sports (soccer, classical ballet, gymnastics, volleyball and basketball), mean age 12.0 ± 2.4 years, sex (male/female: 237/107), BMI 19.0 ± 2.8 (Kg/m 2 ), AJM was evaluated by using an inclinometer while the trunk flexibility was evaluated by the Sit and Reach test.Compared to all other groups, soccer players showed a significant reduction of AJM (p < .005)that is already present in younger subjects and that tends to worsen with aging (p < .04).On the contrary, the young dancers of classic ballet showed a significant increase in the AJM (p < .002).Basketball, volleyball and gymnastics groups showed a similar AJM.The higher AJM showed by females compared to males (128.5 ± 21.0° vs 144.6 ± 18.5°; p < .001) was not significant when the group of soccer players and dancers were excluded from the calculation.All groups investigated did not show a different mobility between the two ankles or the dominant and non-dominant limb.The age of the subjects investigated was not correlated with AJM.The group of gymnasts showed a significant increase in trunk flexibility (p < .001)compared to all other groups.Sport practice can significantly modify AJM both by increasing and reducing it.Such process should be timely assessed in order to prevent these alterations along with the related possible negative effects in the short and long term.","This study examines the impact of different sports on ankle joint mobility (AJM) in young athletes, specifically comparing soccer, ballet, gymnastics, volleyball, and basketball players. The findings reveal that soccer players exhibit significantly reduced AJM, while ballet dancers demonstrate increased mobility, highlighting how sport specialization can influence joint characteristics and the importance of monitoring these changes to prevent potential negative consequences."
The influence of muscle soreness on the speed of performing a motor reaction speed task in football goalkeepers during a training camp,2020-01-01,,,,"Aim: To investigate the influence of muscle soreness on the speed of performing a motor reaction speed task in football goalkeepers. Methods: Twenty-four young healthy football goalkeepers, aged 1618 years old (average 16.7 ±0.67 year), with an average body height of 175.6 ±5.4 cm and body weight of 65 ±5 kg, participated in a study conducted during a 6-day training camp. The first day, referred to as day 0, was intended for initial tests and the following 5 days, referred to as days 15, consisted of training. On day 0, before the training period, anthropometric parameters such as weight and height were measured, subjects were questioned to determine the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and perceived psychophysical readiness (PPR), a speed test with motor reaction choice (ST) was performed using a Smart Speed System and areas with muscle soreness (MS) were recorded by means of a computer tablet with the Navigate Pain application. The goalkeepers participated in two training sessions on each of the following 5 days. Before each training session, the same speed test was performed. Lap times for 5 m and 15 m were recorded. After the second training session each day, the participants drew digital pain maps using a computer tablet, marking separate areas of the body where they felt muscle soreness. These data were consolidated and the total area was analyzed to investigate if, throughout the training, there were any changes to the size of the area that was indicated as having MS. A categorization of body areas was also made to determine areas where muscle soreness was most frequently indicated. Each training session was monitored with heart rate (HR) registration and each goalkeeper determined his fatigue (RPE) and readiness to exercise (PPR) on a 110-point scale. Results: Twenty-three out of twenty-four (98.5%) goalkeepers indicated that they had MS during the study. Day 2 showed the highest incidence rate with 21 participants indicating that they felt MS. The biggest area of MS was also indicated on day 2, yet statistical analysis did not show significant differences in the area of MS between the training days. MS was most often indicated in the upper leg, i.e. the thighs. The average time of the first 5 m was 1.3 [s] (SD = 0.09), ranging from 1.28 [s] to 1.33 [s], while the average time of the following 10 m was 2.07 [s] (SD = 0.18), ranging from 2.04 to 2.1 [s]. The average total speed test time equaled 3.37 [s] (SD = 0.21), ranging from 3.33 to 3.38. Statistical analysis did not show significant differences in any of the results between the training days. Conclusions: Most of the goalkeepers felt muscle soreness as an effect of specific goalkeeper training, measured by indicating painful zones on digital pain drawings. In this study, where muscle soreness was induced by technical-tactical specific goalkeeper training, no significant changes were noticed in the speed of performing a motor speed test with reaction choice or on the area of muscle soreness indicated on digital pain drawings, although almost every goalkeeper had a large area of muscle soreness. Discussion: Many studies show that delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) causes a decrease in strength, power, range of motion and speed. However, in many cases, these studies are designed to induce high intensity DOMS and then conduct isolated motor skill tests. In this study the objective was not to induce high intensity DOMS but to investigate the effect of muscle pain, which is present naturally during training processes, and then assess its effect on a speed test which reflects real game situations – with a component of reaction choice and change of movement and direction. Approaching the subject from a different viewpoint allows us to see that the reliable assessment of the psychophysical state of players, made by observing their actions on the pitch or even using photocells to measure motion speed, is difficult without an insight into the parameters of soreness that players experience. These can be monitored, for example, through digital pain mapping software.","The paper investigates the impact of muscle soreness on the motor reaction speed of football goalkeepers during a training camp, finding that nearly all participants reported muscle soreness, particularly in the thighs, without significant changes in reaction speeds. The study highlights the importance of understanding muscle soreness in relation to performance assessments, utilizing digital pain mapping for a comprehensive evaluation of players' psychophysical states during training."
The Effect of Plyometric Knee Tuck Jump and Barrier Hops Training on Explosive Muscle Explosion Futsal Player,2020-01-01,,,,"The futsal players of SMAN 3 Banjarmasin have weak passing and shooting; therefore, the researchers argue that the futsal players of SMAN 3 Banjarmasin do not have good leg muscle explosive power.This study aims to determine the effect of Plyometric knee tuck jump and barrier hops exercises on the explosive power of the limb muscles of SMAN 3 Banjarmasin.The research method used is a quasiexperiment method with data collection techniques carried out through the initial test, providing treatment as many as 16 meetings and final tests.The population in this study were all futsal players of SMAN 3 Banjarmasin totalling 20 people.A total sample of 20 people with a sampling technique using total sampling or saturated samples.From the research data that has been analyzed and theoretical reviews, it can be concluded: There is an effect of plyometric knee tuck jump training and barrier hops on the explosive power of the limb muscles of futsal players of SMAN 3 Banjarmasin.The average results of the initial test were 184.35 and the final test was 203.7.","The paper investigates the impact of Plyometric knee tuck jump and barrier hop training on the explosive muscle power of futsal players at SMAN 3 Banjarmasin. It concludes that these training methods significantly enhance the explosive power of the limb muscles, as evidenced by improved performance metrics from initial to final tests."
MRI AND ULTRASOUND CRITERIA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF A SPORTS HERNIA IN FOOTBALL PLAYERS,2020-01-01,,,,"The aim of the study is to specify diagnostic MRI and ultrasound criteria for a sports hernia in order to verify its diagnosis in football players.Materials and methods: The study included 50 professional and amateur football players aged 15 to 34 from 2016 to 2019. The criteria for inclusion in the study were: the presence of groin pain in football players, which prevented them from continuing to actively participate in sports activities.Results: The findings of the study revealed that during MRI the two factors, which had the strongest influence, were ""increased MR signal intensity on PDfs observed from the structures of the inguinal canal"" and ""increased MR signal intensity on PDfs observed from bone marrow of superior ramus of the pubic bone"". During ultrasound of the inguinal area, the main criterion for a sports hernia diagnosis was ""increased size of the inguinal canal"". The verification of the diagnosis was carried out on the basis of the presence of a protrusion in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. For a sports hernia diagnosis the MRI sensitivity is 91.67% (95% CI 77.5 - 98.2), specificity -78.57% (95% CI 49.2 - 95.3) and the sensitivity of ultrasound is 88.89% (95% CI 73.9 - 96.9), the specificity - 50% (95% CI 23.0 - 77).Conclusions: The combination of MRI and ultrasound makes it possible to accurately detect the presence of a sports hernia in the football player. Based on the findings of our study, we formulated MRI and ultrasound criteria for a sports hernia diagnosis.","The paper focuses on establishing MRI and ultrasound diagnostic criteria for sports hernia in football players, based on a study of 50 athletes aged 15 to 34. Key findings include specific MRI indicators of increased signal intensity and ultrasound criteria related to the inguinal canal's size, which together offer a reliable diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity."
Effect of small-sided games with manipulation of small targets on the perceived exertion and tactical and technical performance of college soccer players,2020-01-01,,,,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to compare the tactical and technical performance and perceived exertion of college soccer players in small-sided games through the manipulation of small targets. Twenty players divided into four teams, played 5x5 games (25x20 m) with one and two small targets on different days. Games were divided into three four-minute times, with two-minute intervals between bouts. Perceived exertion and technical-tactical variables were evaluated using Ball Transmission Speed (ball received/ball contacts) and Team Sport Assessment Procedure (TSAP). TSAP generates performance indicators, such as: efficiency index, performance score, volume of play and ball attack. They are related to the actions of balls conquered, passes and finalizations. For statistical analysis, paired t test and Cohen’s d effect size were performed to compare the two game configurations. Larger number of balls conquered with small target was verified (p&lt;0.05; d=1.32), generating higher efficiency index and performance score. It was concluded that the perceived exertion is similar with one and two small targets and players recover more balls with only one small target. Through thisinformation, coaches can better handle this type of constraints according to the purpose of the training session.","This study investigates the impact of manipulating small targets on the perceived exertion and performance of college soccer players during small-sided games. The findings indicate that while perceived exertion remains similar with one or two targets, players achieve higher performance metrics and recover more balls when a single small target is utilized."
Biomechanical determinants of injury risk and performance during change of direction : implications for screening and intervention,2020-01-01,,,,"Changing direction is a key action linked to successful performance in multidirectional sports, but also 
an action associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Despite the importance 
of directional changes for sports performance and its association with ACL injury risk, biomechanical 
studies generally investigate performance and injury risk determinants independently. Preliminary 
evidence indicates that the mechanics and techniques associated with faster change of direction (COD) 
performance are at odds with safer (i.e., reduced knee joint loads) COD, known as the “performance
injury conflict”. Therefore, understanding the mechanics and techniques, screening tools, and training 
interventions that can reduce the relative risk of injury during COD actions, while improving 
performance, are of great interest to practitioners working with multidirectional athletes. 
The primary aims of the thesis are three-fold: 1) to identify the biomechanical determinants of 
performance and injury risk during cutting, in order to better understand the potential “performance
injury conflict”; 2) to validate a qualitative screening tool against three-dimensional (3D) motion 
analysis for evaluating cutting movement quality and identifying athletes who display high peak knee 
abduction moments (KAM); and 3) to understand the biomechanical effects of a COD technique 
modification intervention, with the aim of reducing knee joint loads while maintaining or enhancing 
cutting performance. 
Initially, Study 1 (Chapter 4) aimed to examine the effect of trial size on the within- and 
between-session reliability measures and outcome values for cutting biomechanics. Cutting joint angle, 
ground reaction force (GRF), and knee flexion moment (KFM) variables demonstrated high reliability, 
while knee internal rotation moments (KIRMs), KAMs and angles demonstrated high variability and 
bias between sessions. Increasing trial size had a negligible effect on reliability measures and outcome 
values; thus, trial sizes of three to five appear adequate to capture reliable cutting biomechanical data, 
with no apparent requirement for greater trial sizes. 
Study 2 (Chapter 5) aimed to investigate the biomechanical determinants of cutting 
performance and injury risk (knee joint loads). The primary findings were that techniques and 
mechanics associated with faster cutting performance (i.e., faster velocities over the COD, greater final 
foot contact [FFC] braking forces over shorter ground contact times (GCT), greater FFC KFMs, smaller 
hip and knee flexion angles and range of motion (ROM), wider lateral foot plant distances, and greater 
internally rotated foot postures) are in direct conflict with safer cutting mechanics (i.e., reduced knee 
joint loading), and support the concept of a “performance-injury conflict”. 
xiv 
Study 3 (Chapter 6) aimed to validate a qualitative screening tool for identifying “high-risk” 
cutting mechanics and peak KAMs, against 3D motion analysis. The screening tool, titled the “Cutting 
Movement Assessment Score” (CMAS), was a 9-item tool, based on a literature review and findings 
from Study 2 containing the “high-risk” postures and mechanics. A strong relationship was observed 
between CMAS and peak KAMs, and trials and participants who displayed greater CMASs typically 
displayed “higher-risk” postures and greater multiplanar knee joint loads. 
Finally, studies 4 and 5 (Chapters 7 & 8) aimed to examine the effects of a COD technique 
modification intervention on cutting performance and injury risk biomechanics. Study 4 served as a 
feasibility study which was performed in an applied setting. The primary findings were that 6-weeks 
COD technique modification training with externally directed verbal coaching cues improved cutting 
performance and movement quality (i.e., reduced CMASs) in male youth soccer players. 
Study 5 expanded on the feasibility study by comprehensively monitoring the biomechanical 
changes (3D motion and GRF analysis) in response to COD technique modification. The primary 
findings were that 6-weeks COD technique modification training with externally directed verbal 
coaching cues resulted in significant and meaningful improvements in cutting performance. When 
examining group means, no statistically significant or meaningful changes in multiplanar knee joint 
loads were observed; however, there was considerable individual variation in response to the training 
intervention, with athletes considered “higher-risk” responding positively to the intervention. 
Overall, these studies in combination help to provide further insight into the “performance
injury conflict” that is present during cutting, and overall assist in the development of more effective 
COD speed and ACL injury mitigation training programmes. The findings from the thesis provide 
practitioners with: 1) a greater insight into the coaching of faster and safer COD; 2) a field-based 
qualitative screening tool for evaluating cutting movement quality; and 3) training interventions that 
can be easily implemented in the field with minimal equipment to improve COD performance and 
potentially reduce knee joint loading.","The paper investigates the biomechanical determinants of injury risk and performance during change of direction (COD) in sports, particularly focusing on the relationship between faster cutting techniques and knee joint loads, which highlight a “performance-injury conflict.” Through a series of studies, the research validates a qualitative screening tool for identifying high-risk cutting mechanics and demonstrates that a modified COD technique training can enhance performance while potentially mitigating injury risk."
Anthropometric and motor performance characteristics of male soccer players in public universities,2020-01-01,,,,"Background: Training of athletes for optimal performance would be enhanced in an environment of appropriate data. There is, however, limited data on anthropometric and sport performance characteristics of male soccer players in Ghanaian public universities. This study comparatively presents the distribution of anthropometric and motor performance characteristics of male soccer players among public universities. Methods: Male soccer players (n = 44, mean age = 22.61 ±1.87 yrs) from four public universities were recruited. Weight, leg length, thigh girth, calf girth, forearm length, upper arm length, upper arm girth, chest girth, and finger span were measured. The participants were also assessed on a 36.58 m (40 yards) dash, vertical jump, agility, flexibility, sit-ups, push-ups, dribbling, shooting accuracy, and kicking distance. Results: There were significant differences in the forearm length (p = 0.001), leg power (p = 0.040), abdominal strength (p = 0.005), agility (p = 0.001), flexibility (p = 0.009), and upper body strength (p = 0.023) among the male soccer players of the universities. All anthropometric characteristics significantly predicted kicking distance (p = 0.002). Thigh girth (p = 0.014), chest girth (p = 0.010) and finger span (p = 0.012) significantly distinctly served as predictors. Conclusion: Anthropometric and motor performance characteristics were relatively different among male soccer players in Ghana public universities. University soccer coaches should place major emphasis on individual traits and potentials when developing combined training regimes.","This paper examines the anthropometric and motor performance characteristics of male soccer players in Ghanaian public universities. It highlights significant differences in physical attributes and performance metrics among players, suggesting that these characteristics can influence kicking distance and emphasizing the importance of tailored training approaches by coaches."
Evaluation of possible anthropometric advantage in Sit-Up test,2020-01-01,,,,"The players of Pro Football Academy are as part of its quarterly-annual physical fitness in order to assess the abdominal muscular endurance of service-members. However, there is speculation that sit-up performance may be associated with anthropometric proportions thereby affording certain service-members with a biomechanical advantage. To test this theory, anthropometric measurements were taken at various sites (i.e., humerus, torso, femur, and tibia) across a convenience sample of 30 male participants to include players from the Pro Football Academy. Humerus length (r = .297), tibia length (r = .385) and sex (r = .314) were all found to be moderately correlated with sit-up performance. These findings, coupled with well-documented concerns of the sit-ups in terms of safety and relevance in the literature, make a compelling argument for the identification and implementation of other potential field tests to assess abdominal muscular endurance.","The paper investigates the relationship between anthropometric measurements and sit-up performance among players in a Pro Football Academy, suggesting that certain physical proportions may confer a biomechanical advantage in this fitness test. The study finds moderate correlations between humerus and tibia lengths, as well as sex, and sit-up performance, while recommending alternative tests to assess abdominal muscular endurance due to existing concerns regarding the safety and relevance of sit-ups."
Performance Analysis in Sport,2020-01-01,,,,"This presentation will consider what performance analysis is, what biomechanical and notational analysis have in common and how they differ. The main focus will be how they have helped, and can better help, coaches and athletes to analyse and improve sports performance. Biomechanics, notational analysis and motor control all involve the analysis and improvement of sport performance. They make extensive use of video analysis and technology. They require careful information management for good feedback to coaches and performers and systematic techniques of observation. They have theoretical models - based on performance indicators – amenable to AI developments and strong theoretical links with other sport science and IT disciplines. They differ in that biomechanists analyse, in fine-detail, individual sports techniques and their science is grounded in mechanics and anatomy. Notational analysts study technical and tactical patterns in soccer, gross movements or movement patterns, and is primarily concerned with strategy and tactics and has a history in dance and music notation. Notational analysts are gradually establishing their own methodoligial processes and interlinking these with developing theories for the specific problems associated with their data analyses. The practical value of performance analysis is that well-chosen performance indicators highlight good and bad techniques or team performances. They help coaches to identify good and bad performances of a player and facilitate comparative analysis of teams and players. In addition, biomechanics helps to identify injurious techniques while notational analysis helps to assess physiological and psychological demands of sports. Drawing on a range of examples, it will be argued that performance analysts require a unified approach, examining interactions between players, and their individual skill elements. Of fundamental importance is the need for us to pay far greater attention to the principles of providing feedback - technique points that a coach can observe from video and simple counts of events are unlikely to enhance individual or team performance.","This paper explores the role of performance analysis in sports, emphasizing the differences and similarities between biomechanical analysis and notational analysis. It highlights the importance of technology and information management for improving sports performance, as well as the need for a unified approach to examining player interactions and techniques for effective coaching feedback."
Single-leg Standing Ability and Lower Limb Movement Analysis of Collegiate Footballers and Sedentary Students,2020-01-01,,,,"Stability or balance is an integral component to perform daily activities without incurring injury or to be dependent on others.Sportsmen tend to have better balance than non-sports people but less is known about the single-leg balance ability.Furthermore, few studies analyzed the dynamic phase of single-leg stance that may contribute to better overall balance.Sports like football tend to have instances where the player's non-dominant leg keeps them in an upright position while the dominant leg kicks, passes and stops the ball.We aim to study the single-leg balance between collegiate footballers and sedentary students in eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-opened (EO) conditions and their contributing components to keep a body in an up-right position.Twenty collegiate footballers and 20 sedentary students conducted the unipedal stance test (UPST) on each leg with EO and EC conditions while standing on a force platform.We captured center of pressure (CoP) distance travelled, stance duration and using a 3D motion capture system, we assessed lower limb movement at six different anatomical sites.Results showed that footballers had better overall balance compared to sedentary students only in the non-dominant leg, EC condition with 12 footballers versus four sedentary students completing the full 45s stance (p=0.01)The other three UPST conditions did not show significant differences between groups.The CoP distance in the initial dynamic state and total UPST were both significantly shorter in footballers than sedentary students (p<0.05) during the nondominant leg, EC stance.Our multivariable linear regression model significantly predicted time for UPST on non-dominant leg with EC up to 76.8% (p<0.001) with the first 5-s of greater trochanter movement significantly contributing to total time taken for UPST in footballers.Overall, playing football may enhance balance control intrinsically especially for the non-dominant side while being less reliant on visual input to maintain balance.","The paper investigates the single-leg standing ability and lower limb movement of collegiate footballers compared to sedentary students, focusing on balance and stability in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. Findings indicate that footballers exhibit better balance on their non-dominant leg, particularly when visual input is absent, suggesting that football participation enhances balance control."
The relative effect of age in international football: Europe vs South America,2020-01-01,,,,"The concept of relative age effect refers to the consequences of the physical and psychological differences that may exist between those born earlier or later within the same calendar year. The objective of the present study was to examine this phenomenon in international professional football, identifying the influences of the continent. The sample comprised 6414 subjects from 225 teams (115 UEFA and 110 CONMEBOL) from the professional football Leagues (PFL). Statistical analysis was based on the Chi-squared (X2) test followed by the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals estimation. The main results show higher RAE in the CONMEBOL leagues (OR = 2.23) than in the UEFA leagues (OR = 1.95). In addition, in all leagues analysed, except in the Premier League of England there was an over-representation of individuals born in the first few months of the year. We can conclude that the relative age effect is consistent and exists in international football.","This paper examines the relative age effect (RAE) in international professional football, focusing on differences between European (UEFA) and South American (CONMEBOL) leagues. The study finds a stronger prevalence of RAE in CONMEBOL leagues compared to UEFA, indicating the significance of birth month on player representation in professional football."

Effects of hamstring injury history on frontal plane pelvic mechanics,2020-01-01,,,,"The aim of this study is to examine the differences in frontal plane running mechanics of injured runners, compared to their healthy counterparts. Frontal plane pelvic drop results in the knee moving into a valgus position. The hamstrings are recruiting in valgus moments to stabilize the knee. This extra recruitment of the hamstrings during this initial contact event could be a mechanism of injury. Thirty-nine subjects performed three 50-meter sprints, with three Opal sensors placed on the pelvis; one on each iliac crest and one on the sacrum. Subjects were divided into six groups based on gender, athletic ability and injury history. The vertical acceleration measured by the sensors was used to discern patterns within a subject's running gait. The data was used to analyze; variability, impact magnitude and rate, instability and asymmetry during each single leg stance throughout the run, to investigate between group differences. Differences between injured leg and healthy leg stance were examined for the injured populations as well. Analysis of the data found significant differences between the groups. Injured athlete displayed greater instability and asymmetry during injured leg stance than healthy leg stance. Differences between athlete and non-athlete populations for variability were present, with athletes exhibiting lower variability than their non-athlete counterparts. This study demonstrates that within injured athletes there is difference in ground contact dynamics between injured and healthy legs. These athletes might benefit from intervention and rehabilitation strategies targeting postural control and stability during dynamic tasks.--Author's abstract","This paper investigates the differences in frontal plane running mechanics between injured and healthy runners, focusing on pelvic drop and its relation to knee stability. The findings indicate that injured athletes exhibit greater instability and asymmetry in their running gait, suggesting that targeted rehabilitation strategies could enhance postural control and stability in these individuals."
Comparing Biomechanical Risk Factors of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury of Elite Female Soccer Players During the Shearing Maneuver and Header on the Natural Grass and Artificial Turf,2020-01-01,,,,"Introduction: Nowadays, the use of artificial turf fields has become widespread. Given the high prevalence of noncontact injuries among female soccer players and high contribution of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury, this research was conducted to compare biomechanical risk factors in the incidence of ACL injury for elite female soccer players during shearing maneuver and header on the natural grass and artificial turf fields. Methods: Sixteen players were selected from U-14 women’s national team by the convenience sampling method and started to perform the skills. Knee joint information was calculated by a 3D imaging system and a force plate. Statistical differences were reported using the dependent t-test at a significant level of 0.05. Results: The findings showed that the biomechanical behavior of the lower extremity while performing soccer skills on the natural grass was affected differently from that on the artificial turf. Results also demonstrated that the torque applied to the knee joint on the natural grass was higher than that on the artificial turf (P=0.039). Angular velocity on the artificial turf was also higher than that on the natural grass (P=0.006). Conclusion: The higher knee joint torque and the lower angular velocity on natural grass may result in a higher risk of ACL injury on the natural grass than on the artificial turf. Therefore, the use of prevention programs for ACL injury is crucial to minimize the incidence of lower extremity injuries.","This paper investigates the biomechanical risk factors for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries among elite female soccer players during shearing maneuvers and headers on both natural grass and artificial turf. The study found that higher knee joint torque on natural grass, coupled with lower angular velocity compared to artificial turf, may increase the risk of ACL injuries, highlighting the need for preventive strategies in training."
Improving ligament tissue scaffold with the use of genipin and gold nanoparticles,2020-01-01,,,,"Decellularized tissue is used for a wide array of tissue injuries with tendon and ligament repair being among the most common. However, despite their frequent use there is concern over the lengthy inflammatory period and slow healing associated with allografts. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been shown to improve wound healing by decreasing inflammation and promoting cellularity and biological incorporation. The focus of this dissertation was testing the effects of AuNPs on ligament repair and assessing the use of genipin as a novel method of attaching the particles. In vitro studies were conducted to examine the ability of genipin to attach AuNPs to both unprocessed tissue and a decellularized tissue scaffold. Cell studies were conducted to observe the biocompatibility of the composite tissue. The results demonstrated successful attachment of the AuNPs and successful cell attachment and proliferation. An in vivo study was conducted using sheep to observe the effects of AuNPs on ACL repair. The experimental grafts had better histological scores and decreased inflammation in comparison to the controls.","This paper investigates the enhancement of ligament tissue scaffolds using genipin and gold nanoparticles to improve tissue repair. The study demonstrates successful attachment of gold nanoparticles to decellularized tissues, enhances cell proliferation, and shows improved healing outcomes in an in vivo model of ACL repair with reduced inflammation."
Toward an Understanding of the Professional Work of NCAA Division I Soccer Coaches,2020-01-01,,,,"Very little is known about the professional work of NCAA Division I (DI) coaches, which poses challenges for coach educators to create relevant professional development opportunities for coaches in this context. The present study looked at the full scope of work of NCAA DI FBS head women’s soccer coaches. The aim of this project was to explore the coaches’ perspectives of their jobs to improve our understanding of the contextual nuances of working in a DI environment. In this qualitative study, four participants were interviewed in-person utilizing a vignette-style, semi-structured interview guide. Data were analyzed using an interpretivist- constructivist approach (Sparks & Smith, 2014) and applied thematic analysis (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey, 2012). Higher and lower-order themes were categorized under the following headings: DI contextual characteristics, job responsibilities, coaching processes, knowledge requirements, and job challenges. Key findings included the amount of resources and pressure to win at the DI level, attention given to recruiting, the required managerial skills needed to perform the job effectively, and the challenges of communicating and motivating Generation Z athletes. These findings offer foundational information needed to better understand the professional work of DI collegiate coaching.

Intra and inter-rater agreement of the Dynamic Movement Assessment ™ Agreement of the DMA™,2020-01-01,,,,"Aims: To investigate the inter-and intra-rater agreement of the Dynamic Movement Assessment (DMA™) risk classification. Method: In this study, after the anthropometric measurements were made, 17 female soccer athletes were filmed performing the six DMA™ tests (full squat, step-up, single-leg squat, jump test, test plank, and side plank). Both, major and secondary deviations, were observed during the tests. Two experienced health professionals performed video analysis using Kinovea 8.15.0 (inter-rater agreement). To assess the intra-rater agreement, the same video analysis was performed two months later. Participants were rated from 0 to 21 points and at low, medium, moderate, and high risk of developing musculoskeletal injuries. To assess the reliability of the assessment of movement patterns of DMA, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was performed with a 2-way random-effects model with an absolute agreement (inter-rater) and a 2-way mixed-effects model and consistency (intra-rater). Weighted Kappa Agreement Analysis (kw) was performed with linear weights to assess the level of agreement related to the risk classification of DMA (high, moderate, medium, or minimum). The Analysis was performed with StatsDirect v.3 and SPSS (23.0). Results: Comparing the number of points between the inter-and intra-rater, the ICC was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.74-0.97) and 0.84 (95% CI = 0.59-0.94), respectively, with kw = 0.46 (P = 0.02) intra -rater and kw = 0.46 (P = 0.006) inter-rater (Table 9). Conclusion: DMA has excellent inter-and intra-rater reliability to evaluate movement patterns and classify the risk of musculoskeletal injuries.","This paper examines the inter-and intra-rater agreement of the Dynamic Movement Assessment (DMA™) in classifying the risk of musculoskeletal injuries among female soccer athletes. The findings indicate that DMA™ demonstrates high reliability, with inter-rater and intra-rater agreement coefficients suggesting effective assessment of movement patterns and risk classification."
IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL PREPAREDNESS OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS ON THE BASIS OF MODELING OF DETERMINED FORMS OF ORGANIZATION OF TRAINING PROCESS,2020-01-01,,,,"In modern football, the result depends on many aspects of the functional training of athletes, including technical, tactical, physical, physiological and psychological factors, as well as fitness and health of individual athletes. Diagnosis of functional readiness of football players allows to analyze these factors on separate components and, to use the received information for adjustment of programs of construction of trainings, their short-term and longterm planning, choosing of players for a match, etc. Organizing the study, we assumed that the use in this process of a program adapted to the specific conditions of football, age and qualifications of athletes, will provide objective information about the dynamics of relevant indicators and, on this basis, to improve training management technology using adequate training loads. Implementation of the program based on modeling of deterministic forms of training process, which sets the load parameters: the intensity of training effects and their duration, duration and nature of rest between exercises, their ratio and dosage, in the training process, will increase the level of functional readiness and potential opportunities for football players to achieve high sports results in the process of multi-year training. The purpose of the study: to test experimentally the impact of the developed program on the indicators of functional readiness of football players at the stage of preparation for higher achievements. To solve the assigned tasks, the pedagogical experiment was conducted on the basis of a team participating in the football championship of Shandong Province (People’s Republic of China) among young people aged 16-17 in the amount of 12 people. Research methods: theoretical (analysis, synthesis, generalization); pedagogical observations; pedagogical experiment; methods of mathematical and statistical data processing. The effectiveness of the developed program is proved and statistically significant differences in the corresponding indicators between the control and experimental groups of football players at the stage of preparation for higher achievements are testified (p&lt;0.05 – p&lt;0.01). The application of the program in the training process contributed to the significant optimization of the functional state of the cardiovascular system and the system of external respiration of the studied football players at the stage of preparation for higher achievements.","This paper focuses on enhancing the functional preparedness of football players through a tailored training process model.

Persistent biomechanical deficits observed in professional soccer players with a history of hamstring injury during a reactive functional test,2020-01-01,,,,"<i>Objectives</i>: The aim of the study was to estimate hip extensor muscle stretching capacity as a function of previous hamstring injury during a for-purpose, standardised test permitting unrestricted full-body movement, including hamstrings, adductors and gluteal muscle length evaluated using a musculoskeletal modelling approach. <i>Method</i>: Twenty-seven professional footballers, distributed in two groups (control or previously injured), performed a reactive functional test to one of four targets from a standing start and performed a knee and plantar extension on target. Joint kinematics served as input data of a musculoskeletal model, and joint angles and hip extensor muscle lengths were calculated <i>Results</i>: A reduced range of motion of anterior pelvis, hip and knee joints at the peak of BFlh length was observed associated with a lesser ability to actively stretch the posterior muscle chain. Additionally, a shorter time-to-peak length in was found in previously-injured compared to non-previously-injured players during the functional test. <i>Conclusion: </i>Persistent biomechanical deficits can be observed in athletes with HSI even after undergoing rehabilitation and returning to a full competition and training schedule. Musculoskeletal modelling allowed the analysis of musculoskeletal function in greater detail than using kinematics assessment alone. These findings contribute to assist medical practitioners, sport physicians and physiotherapists to design efficient programmes for diagnosis and management of HSI injury.<i></i>","The paper investigates the persistent biomechanical deficits in professional soccer players with a history of hamstring injuries, focusing on hip extensor muscle stretching capacity and joint kinematics during a reactive functional test.

Evidence for Rehabilitation Interventions After Acute Lateral Ankle Sprains in Athletes: A Scoping Review,2021-12-30,,,,"Acute lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is a common injury in athletes and is often associated with decreased athletic performance and, if treated poorly, can result in chronic ankle issues, such as instability. Physical performance demands, such as cutting, hopping, and landing, involved with certain sport participation suggests that the rehabilitation needs of an athlete after LAS may differ from those of the general population.To review the literature to determine the most effective rehabilitation interventions reported for athletes returning to sport after acute LAS.Data Sources: Databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and PEDro were searched to July 2020.A scoping review protocol was developed and followed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines and registered (https://osf.io/bgek3/). Study selection included published articles on rehabilitation for ankle sprain in an athletic population.Parameters included athlete and sport type, age, sex, intervention investigated, outcome measures, measurement tool, and follow-up period.A qualitative synthesis for all articles was undertaken, and a quantitative subanalysis of randomized controlled trials and critical methodological appraisal was also conducted.A total of 37 articles were included in this review consisting of 5 systematic and 20 narrative reviews, 7 randomized controlled trials, a single-case series, case report, position statement, critically appraised topic, and descriptive study. Randomized controlled trial interventions included early dynamic training, electrotherapy, and hydrotherapy.Early dynamic training after acute LAS in athletes results in a shorter time to return to sport, increased functional performance, and decreased self-reported reinjury. The results of this scoping review support an early functional and dynamic rehabilitation approach when compared to passive interventions for athletes returning to sport after LAS. Despite existing research on rehabilitation of LAS in the general population, a lack of evidence exists related to athletes seeking to return to sport.","This paper reviews the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for athletes recovering from acute lateral ankle sprains (LAS), highlighting the unique needs of athletes compared to the general population. The findings emphasize the benefits of early dynamic training, which leads to quicker return-to-sport times and improved functional performance, while contrasting with the less effective passive intervention approaches."
Reliability and Repeatability of ACL Quick Check®: A Methodology for on Field Lower Limb Joint Kinematics and Kinetics Assessment in Sport Applications,2021-12-30,,,,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion represents one of the most dramatic sport injuries. Even though clinical screenings aiming at identifying subjects at risk of injuries are gaining popularity, the use of sophisticated equipment still represents a barrier towards their widespread use. This study aimed to test both reliability and repeatability of a new methodology to assess lower limb joints kinematics and kinetics directly on field with the aid of video cameras and plantar pressure insoles. Ten athletes and one case study (post ACL surgery) were assessed in a gait laboratory, while performing double leg squats, through the simultaneous acquisition of stereophotogrammetry, force plates, commercial video cameras and plantar pressure insoles. Different sources of errors were investigated and both reliability and repeatability analysis performed. Minimum and maximum RMSE values of 0.74% (right knee joint center trajectory) and 64.51%, respectively (ankle dorsi-plantarflexion moment), were detected. Excellent to good correlation was found for the majority of the measures, even though very poor and inverse between-trials correlation was found on a restricted number of trials especially for the ankle dorsi-plantarflexion moment. These findings could be used in combination with already available screening tools in order to provide more repeatable results.","This paper evaluates the reliability and repeatability of the ACL Quick Check® methodology for assessing lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics in a field setting. The study highlights the methodology's potential for enhancing injury risk assessments among athletes by demonstrating good correlation and minimal error across various measurements, despite some challenges identified in specific trials."
Reliability of the Hip Extension Lower Exercise as a Measure of Eccentric Hamstring Strength,2021-12-30,,,,"Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is a very common lower-body injury in field sports, and eccentric (ECC) hamstring strength is a potential modifiable risk factor, therefore having reliable eccentric hamstring strength assessments is critical. The aim of this study was to access test–retest reliability of the hip extension lower (HEL) exercise as a measure of ECC hamstring strength and inter-limb asymmetries. Twelve male elite level soccer players (mean; age: 21.8 years; height: 180.4 cm; weight: 75.7 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Participants were from the same soccer club, covered all playing positions, and had no current injury issues. Participants performed two familiarization sessions to acquaint themselves with the device and exercise protocol. During testing, each participant performed three repetitions with 60s intra-set recovery provided. Average and peak force (N) was recorded for both limbs. Testing sessions took place on the same day and time over a two-week pre-season period and followed a full recovery day. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Coefficient of Variation (CV%), Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) and Typical Error (TE) were used to assess reliability. The HEL showed excellent reliability for average force (N) in the left (ICC (95% CI) = 0.9 (0.7–0.97); TE = 14.1 N, CV% = 1.87; MDC = 39.06 N) and right (ICC (95% CI) = 0.91 (0.73–0.97); TE = 20.89 N, CV% = 3.26; MDC = 57.87 N) limb, and also excellent reliability for peak force in the left (ICC (95% CI) = 0.91 (0.71–0.97); TE = 13.55 N, CV% = 1.61; MDC = 57.87 N) and right (ICC (95% CI) = 0.9 (0.7–0.97); TE = 21.70 N, CV% = 3.31; MDC = 60.11 N) limb. This data suggests the HEL as a reliable measure of both ECC hamstring strength and inter-limb asymmetries. Practitioners should consider the HEL as a reliable choice for measuring and monitoring eccentric hamstring strength in their athletes.","This paper investigates the reliability of the Hip Extension Lower (HEL) exercise as a measure of eccentric hamstring strength and inter-limb asymmetries in elite male soccer players. The results demonstrate that the HEL exercise provides excellent reliability for assessing both average and peak force in hamstring strength, suggesting its utility for practitioners in monitoring athlete performance and injury risk."
Examining the Relationship Between a Neuromuscular Control Baseline Battery for Sport-Related Concussion and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk,2021-12-30,,,,"To examine the relationship between the m-CTSIB and Landing Error Scoring System in a sample of collegiate female athletes.Recent literature has linked concussion and neuromuscular deficits in the lower extremity after injury. Neuromuscular control is frequently assessed using balance measures for concussion, but also dynamically to identify anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) risk via jump-landing movement screening.Thirty-nine healthy, collegiate female soccer (n = 22) and volleyball (n = 17) athletes completed the modified-Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction of Balance (m-CTSIB) and the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS). Measures consisted of total m-CTSIB sway index scores on individual conditions (firm surface eyes open [condition 1] and eyes closed [2], foam surface eyes open [3] and eyes closed [4]), m-CTSIB overall score, and total LESS errors. LESS scores were also categorized into a low (0-4 errors) and high (5 + errors) risk to determine if athletes with worse neuromuscular control on the LESS has worse balance on the m-CTSIB. A Spearman's rank-order correlation was conducted to determine the strength of the relationship between LESS and m-CTSIB performance. A series of Mann-Whitney U test were performed to determine differences between low and high LESS performance on m-CTSIB performance.There was a weak, negative correlation between LESS and m-CTSIB performance (rs(37) = -0.153, p = 0.35). Further, there were no differences between the low and high risk LESS groups on sway index scores on conditions 1 (U = 158.5, p = 0.39), 2 (U = 156.0, p = 0.36), 3 (U = 165.5, p = 0.51), or 4 (U = 128.5, p = 0.08), as well as overall m-CTSIB scores (U = 150.5, p = 0.28).There appears to be a lack of relationship between the LESS and m-CTSIB tests, revealing the independence of static and dynamic lower extremity neuromuscular function. Athletes who may be more at risk for ACL injury due to abnormal jump-landing biomechanics, do not differ from low-risk athletes on baseline balance assessment.","The paper examines the relationship between specific balance assessments (m-CTSIB) and a jump-landing error scoring system (LESS) in collegiate female athletes to explore connections between concussions and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk. The findings indicate a weak correlation and no significant differences in balance performance between athletes identified as high or low risk for ACL injuries, suggesting independence between static and dynamic lower extremity neuromuscular function."
Effects of plyometric and strength trainings on selected physical fitness variables in Ethiopia youth sport academy female soccer players,2021-12-30,,,,"Plyometric is an exercise in which muscles exert force in short intervals of time. Back then, it was only employed in track and field events and was known as “jump training.” The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of plyometric and strength trainings on selected physical fitness variables in Ethiopia Youth Sport Academy female soccer players. The study used quasi-experimental design. Random sampling technique was used to group the participants into plyometric and strength training groups. Both groups performed selected exercises for consecutive twelve weeks, implemented two days per week and two hours in each session. Paired sample t-test and independent t-test were conducted to analyze the change scores from pre and posttest for all subjects and from separated groups. The paired sample t-test results revealed that players in the plyometric group significantly improved their agility (p&lt;0.05) and explosive power performance (p&lt;0.05) from baseline to the end of the intervention. Whereas, female soccer players in the strength group only improved their explosive power (p&lt;0.05) following twelve-week of strength training intervention. As the independent sample t-test result identified no significant performance difference in agility (p&gt;0.05) and explosive power (p&gt;0.05) performances between the groups. In general, following twelve-week of continuous plyometric and strength trainings the study identified that both training interventions improved the agility and explosive power ability of female soccer players and no significant performance differences had been identified between the two groups.","The paper investigates the effects of plyometric and strength training on physical fitness variables in female soccer players from the Ethiopia Youth Sport Academy. It concludes that both training interventions led to improvements in agility and explosive power, though no significant performance differences were observed between the two training groups."
Defining Training and Performance Caliber: A Participant Classification Framework,2021-12-29,,,,"Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term ""elite"" subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.","This paper proposes a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework designed to systematically categorize individuals based on training volume and performance metrics across various athletic abilities, ranging from sedentary individuals to world-class athletes.

Quantitative Analysis of Performance Recovery in Semi-Professional Football Players after the COVID-19 Forced Rest Period,2021-12-29,,,,"This study proposes the instrumental analysis of the physiological and biomechanical adaptation of football players to a fatigue protocol during the month immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown, to get insights into fitness recovery. Eight male semi-professional football players took part in the study and filled a questionnaire about their activity during the lockdown. At the resumption of activities, the mean heart rate and covered distances during fatiguing exercises, the normalized variations of mean and maximum exerted power in the Wingate test and the Bosco test outcomes (i.e., maximum height, mean exerted power, relative strength index, leg stiffness, contact time, and flight time) were measured for one month. Questionnaires confirmed a light-intensity self-administered physical activity. A significant effect of fatigue (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p < 0.05) on measured variables was confirmed for the four weeks. The analysis of the normalized variations of the aforementioned parameters allowed the distinguishing of two behaviors: downfall in the first two weeks, and recovery in the last two weeks. Instrumental results suggest a physiological and ballistic (i.e., Bosco test outcomes) recovery after four weeks. As concerns the explosive skills, the observational data are insufficient to show complete recovery.","This study investigates the physiological and biomechanical adaptations of semi-professional football players recovering from a forced rest due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Key findings indicate a decline in performance metrics during the initial two weeks post-resumption, followed by recovery in the subsequent weeks, highlighting the importance of monitoring fitness recovery and adaptations following extended inactivity."

"Epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis of tendinopathy among athletes",2021-12-27,,,,"The treatment of tendinopathy can be challenging for clinicians and might be associated with serious adverse events. However, evidence shows that tendinopathy can significantly impact the professional careers of the affected athletes. The main clinical features of the condition include decreased performance and strength of the affected tendons, swelling, and localized pain. Although tendinopathy might seem a non-critical condition, estimates show that it might be career-ending for many professional athletes, and therefore, reducing their quality of life. In the present literature review, we have discussed the epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis of tendinopathy among athletes. Different intrinsic and extrinsic factors were found to contribute to the development of the condition and the impact of various systemic diseases. Evidence also shows that the prevalence of the condition is high among athletes. However, these rates were variable across the different studies in the literature. This is probably owing to various factors, like demographics and the process of detection. The pathogenesis of the condition is also very complicated, and the development of pain has been attributed to the process of angiogenesis and associated ingrowth of nerve fibers.","This paper reviews the epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis of tendinopathy among athletes, highlighting its significant impact on athletic performance and the potential career-ending consequences for affected individuals. It discusses various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the condition, noting the complexity of its pathogenesis and the variable prevalence rates reported in literature."
"Predictive Analytic Techniques to Identify Hidden Relationships between Training Load, Fatigue and Muscle Strains in Young Soccer Players",2021-12-24,,,,"This study aimed to analyze different predictive analytic techniques to forecast the risk of muscle strain injuries (MSI) in youth soccer based on training load data. Twenty-two young soccer players (age: 13.5 ± 0.3 years) were recruited, and an injury surveillance system was applied to record all MSI during the season. Anthropometric data, predicted age at peak height velocity, and skeletal age were collected. The session-RPE method was daily employed to quantify internal training/match load, and monotony, strain, and cumulative load over the weeks were calculated. A countermovement jump (CMJ) test was submitted before and after each training/match to quantify players’ neuromuscular fatigue. All these data were used to predict the risk of MSI through different data mining models: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among them, SVM showed the best predictive ability (area under the curve = 0.84 ± 0.05). Then, Decision tree (DT) algorithm was employed to understand the interactions identified by the SVM model. The rules extracted by DT revealed how the risk of injury could change according to players’ maturity status, neuromuscular fatigue, anthropometric factors, higher workloads, and low recovery status. This approach allowed to identify MSI and the underlying risk factors.","This study investigates the use of predictive analytic techniques to assess the risk of muscle strain injuries (MSI) among young soccer players based on training load and other relevant factors. The research identifies key predictors such as players' maturity, neuromuscular fatigue, and anthropometric data, revealing the complex relationships that influence the likelihood of injury."
Predicting Noncontact Lower Limb Injury Using Lumbar Morphology in Professional Australian Football and Rugby League Players,2021-12-22,,,,"Noncontact lower limb injuries are common within the Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL). Smaller (<8.5 cm2) lumbar multifidus at the fifth vertebra (LM L5) and larger (>8.2 cm2) quadratus lumborum (QL) cross-sectional area (CSA) have been associated with increased noncontact lower limb injury risk in AFL players. These associations have not been explored in an NRL cohort. This study will attempt to replicate previous research findings by confirming that muscle morphology is associated with noncontact lower limb injury.AFL (n = 87) and NRL (n = 151) players underwent LM L2-L5 and QL CSA ultrasound measures during preseason. Each club's medical staff reported all noncontact lower limb injuries sustained in the subsequent regular season. LM and QL CSA, age, body mass index, and noncontact lower limb injuries were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Seventy-two players sustained a noncontact lower limb injury in the 2020 regular season (AFL = 21, NRL = 51). The multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.85; P = 0.038) identified AFL players with larger QL CSA at increased risk of sustaining a noncontact lower limb injury during the regular season, but no relationship was found for LM CSA and noncontact lower limb injuries in the AFL (OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.36-2.78; P = 0.591) or NRL (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.29-1.33; P = 0.149).AFL players who sustained regular season noncontact lower limb injuries had larger QL CSA in preseason tests. No significant associations between either LM L5 CSA or LM L5 to QL ratio and regular season noncontact lower limb injuries were found.","This paper investigates the relationship between lumbar muscle morphology and the risk of noncontact lower limb injuries in professional Australian Football and Rugby League players. It identifies that larger quadratus lumborum cross-sectional area is associated with increased injury risk in AFL players, while no significant relationship was found for lumbar multifidus or in NRL players."
ELİT FUTBOLCULARIN SABAH VE AKŞAM ANTRENMANLARINDAKİ KOŞU PARAMETRELERİNİN KARŞILAŞTIRILMASI,2021-12-21,,,,"Purpose: Although there are many studies in the literature regarding the running of soccer players, there is a need to examine the running asymmetry of the athletes' actual training, regardless of a specific intervention protocol. The aim of this study was to compare the running asymmetry of healthy elite soccer players in training sessions at different times of the day. Methods: Sixteen healthy male elite soccer players were included in this study. Global Positioning System units (GPSports, SPI Pro, 5 Hz, GPSport, Canberra, Australia) were used to define training and running details. Fourteen (7 morning, 7 evening) training data were evaluated. Results: There was no statistical difference between morning and evening trainings in terms of training time, heart rate average and total running distance except for high speed running distance. Running asymmetry was 66% greater in evening training sessions than in morning training sessions (p=0.001; 4.13±1.92, 2.49±1.32 respectively). Running asymmetry did not show any significant correlation with training time, heart rate average, running distance, and high speed running distance (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Running asymmetry is higher in evening training sessions than in morning training sessions. Therefore, for athletes who are particularly at high risk of injury or who are in the process of a return to sports, and from whom high performance is not expected, morning trainings may be preferred instead of evening trainings. If training can not be performed in the morning, clinicians should follow the athletes instantly during evening training.","This study investigates the running asymmetry of elite soccer players during morning and evening training sessions. The findings indicate that running asymmetry is significantly greater in evening sessions, suggesting that morning training may be preferable for athletes at higher injury risk."

Training Management of the Elite Adolescent Soccer Player throughout Maturation,2021-12-17,,,,"Professional soccer clubs invest significantly into the development of their academy prospects with the hopes of producing elite players. Talented youngsters in elite development systems are exposed to high amounts of sports-specific practise with the aims of developing the foundational skills underpinning the capabilities needed to excel in the game. Yet large disparities in maturation status, growth-related issues, and highly-specialised sport practise predisposes these elite youth soccer players to an increased injury risk. However, practitioners may scaffold a performance monitoring and injury surveillance framework over an academy to facilitate data-informed training decisions that may not only mitigate this inherent injury risk, but also enhance athletic performance. Constant communication between members of the multi-disciplinary team enables context to build around an individual's training status and risk profile, and ensures that a progressive, varied, and bespoke training programme is provided at all stages of development to maximise athletic potential.","This paper discusses the training management of elite adolescent soccer players, emphasizing the importance of monitoring maturation status and injury risk. It highlights the need for a data-informed approach in training decisions and effective communication among the coaching staff to optimize performance while minimizing injury."
Exercise-Based Injury Prevention in High-Level and Professional Athletes: Narrative Review and Proposed Standard Operating Procedure for Future Lockdown-Like Contexts After COVID-19,2021-12-17,,,,"In regular times, implementing exercise-based injury prevention programs into the training routine of high-level and professional athletes represents a key and challenging aspect to decrease injury risk. Barriers to implementing such prevention programs have previously been identified such as lack of resources, logistic issues or motivation. The COVID-19 pandemic associated with restrictions on daily life dramatically impacted sports participation from training to competition. It is therefore reasonable to assume that such lockdown-like context has exacerbated the challenge to implement exercise-based injury prevention programs, potentially leading to a greater musculoskeletal injury risk. In this narrative review, recommendations are proposed for building an expertise- and evidence-based Standard Operating Procedure for injury prevention in lockdown-like contexts for high-level and professional athletes. The following recommendations can be provided: (1) assess the global and sport-specific risks in the light of the ongoing cause of isolation; (2) adapt remote training materials and programs; (3) ensure regular quality communication within the staff, between athletes and the staff as well as between athletes; (4) follow the athlete's mental well-being; and (5) plan for a safe return-to-sports as well as for an ongoing monitoring of the load-recovery balance. These key domains should further be addressed to comply with local policies, which are subject to change over time in each individual country. The use of these recommendations may improve the readiness of athletes, coaches, physicians and all sports stakeholders for future lockdown-like contexts.","This paper reviews the implementation of exercise-based injury prevention programs for high-level and professional athletes, particularly in the context of challenges posed by lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Occupational risk factors for meniscal lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-12-15,,,,"Abstract Background Meniscal lesions are common and are associated with the development of knee osteoarthritis. Knee-straining activities at work such as kneeling or squatting cause high biomechanical stresses on the knee joints that can lead to acute or chronic injuries. The objective of this systematic review is to update the evidence on the potential relationship between occupational risk factors and meniscal lesions. Methods We searched the Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases until August 2021 to identify epidemiological observational studies on the association between occupational risk factors and meniscal lesions. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Effect measures were extracted from individual studies and pooled with random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity analyses were conducted. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to assess the overall quality of evidence. Results The database search resulted in 11,006 references, and 46 additional studies were identified through hand search. Twenty-two studies (represented in 25 publications) met the predefined eligibility criteria and nine records were included in the meta-analysis. There was only one study with an overall low risk of bias. Significant associations between occupational risk factors and the development of meniscal lesions were found for kneeling (effect size (ES) 2.15, 95% CI 1.67–2.76), squatting (ES 2.01, 95% CI 1.34–3.03), climbing stairs (ES 2.28, 95% CI 1.58–3.30), lifting and carrying weights ≥ 10 kg (ES 1.63, 95% CI 1.35–1.96), lifting and carrying weights ≥ 25 kg (ES 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.24), playing football on a professional level (ES 5.22, 95% CI 3.24–8.41), working as a hard coal miner (ES 5.23, 95% CI 2.16–12.69) and floor layers (ES 1.99, 95% CI 1.43–2.78). The overall quality of evidence according GRADE was moderate to low. Conclusion We found consistent evidence of an increased risk of meniscal lesions by occupational knee-straining exposures. Our findings are important for the development of preventive strategies to reduce work-related knee disorders and work absence. Trial registration PROSPERO (registration no.

Improvement in peripherical visual attentional performance in professional soccer players following a single neurofeedback training,2021-12-15,,,,"Abstract The effectiveness of EEG-neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) in modulating cognition has been the subject of much research for several years, particularly in relation to attentional functions in healthy subjects and those with attentional deficits. However, its effectiveness on sports performance remains poorly studied and its use is not widely practised among athletes, notably because of its accessibility and questionable effectiveness. The aim of this study is to show that this technology can be accessible, and that Alpha EEG-NFB is immediately effective. Fifteen professional soccer players took part in this study. Using a novel EEG headset that can be installed in less than one minute, and new processing software, the players performed two peripherical attentional tasks before and after, immediately and one month, a single Alpha EEG-NFB training session. The results showed a significant effect on both tasks immediately after EEG-NFB training, with a benefit of more than 30% and this performance continued after one month (20%). This study, the first to use this headset and software, shows that the improvement in sports performance can be related to cognitive performance, especially peripherical visual attentional functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the use of the EEG-NFB is accessible and effective for high-level athletes.","This paper investigates the impact of EEG-neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) training on peripheral visual attentional performance in professional soccer players. The study found significant improvements in attentional tasks immediately after and one month following the training, highlighting the effectiveness and accessibility of EEG-NFB for enhancing cognitive performance in athletes."
Laboratory assessment of a head impact sensor for youth soccer ball heading impacts using an anthropomorphic test device,2021-12-14,,,,"Recent advances in technology have enabled the development of instrumented equipment, which estimate the head impact kinematics of athletes in vivo. One such headband-mounted impact sensor is the SIM-G (Triax Technologies, Norwalk, CT, USA), which has been previously used to investigate the biomechanics of soccer heading by human subjects. Previous studies have evaluated the accuracy of the SIM-G for pure rotation and pendulum, impulse hammer and drop rig impacts. The current study used a soccer ball heading model to evaluate the accuracy of the SIM-G. A soccer ball was projected at the head of an anthropomorphic test device (ATD) representing a 10-year-old to replicate the heading maneuver at various impact sites, angles and speeds previously identified in youth soccer. Linear regression revealed that the SIM-G sensor overestimated the peak angular velocity and linear acceleration recorded by the ATD headform by approximately 44% and 105%, respectively. Tests in which the ball directly contacted the SIM-G sensor resulted in the largest peak linear accelerations. Glancing impacts were significantly associated with a decrease in percentage error of the SIM-G sensor peak angular velocity data relative to the ATD reference data. While it may not demonstrate accuracy in estimating the magnitudes of head impacts, the SIM-G remains a useful tool to provide estimates of head impact exposure for soccer players.","This paper evaluates the accuracy of the SIM-G head impact sensor in measuring the kinematics of head impacts during youth soccer ball heading using an anthropomorphic test device. The study finds that while the SIM-G overestimates peak angular velocity and linear acceleration, it is still a valuable tool for estimating head impact exposure in soccer players."
The Effectiveness of Virtual Reality on Anxiety and Performance in Female Soccer Players,2021-12-13,,,,"With the increased use of technology, relaxation interventions are finding their way into technology devices like virtual reality head-mounted displays (VR HMDs). However, there is a lack of evidence on the efficacy of VR relaxation interventions to reduce anxiety in athletes and how that is portrayed in their movement patterns. The purpose of the current study was to examine how a VR relaxation intervention affected perceived anxiety levels and penalty kick performance of female soccer players. Thirteen female soccer players took five penalty kicks in baseline, stress-induced, and VR relaxation conditions. Perceived levels of anxiety, self-confidence, mental effort, heart rate (HR), accelerometry of the lumbar spine and thigh, and performance in each condition was obtained. Results indicated that the VR intervention significantly reduced cognitive anxiety and somatic anxiety from baseline (p = 0.002; p = 0.001) and stress (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Kendall's W = 0.72; 0.83). VR significantly increased self-confidence from baseline (p = 0.002) and stress (p = 0.001) with a large effect size (Kendall's W = 0.71). Additionally, all participants felt that VR helped them relax. Mental effort was significantly higher in the stress condition compared to that in baseline (p = 0.007) with moderate effect size (Kendall's W = 0.39). Peak acceleration and performance were not significantly influenced by stress or VR. This study serves as an initial step to evaluate VR relaxation interventions on performance in female soccer players.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) relaxation interventions on anxiety and performance in female soccer players during penalty kicks. The findings reveal that the VR intervention significantly reduced both cognitive and somatic anxiety while enhancing self-confidence, although it did not notably affect movement patterns or performance metrics."
"Isometric knee torque, quadriceps-hamstrings ratio, and jumping parameters in Brazilian soccer players of different age categories",2021-12-10,,,,"Purpose This study assessed the isometric torque, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, and jump performance among three age groups of soccer players. Methods 67 male players were divided by chronological age into the under-17 (U17: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), under-20 (U20: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 22), and above-20-year (PRO: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) groups. They performed countermovement (CMJ) and squat (SJ) jumps. Also, maximal isometric contractions during knee flexion and extension for right (R-TOR) and left limb (L-TOR) torque were assessed. Hamstrings-quadriceps (H:Q) and CMJ:SJ ratios were determined. Results Compared with U17 and U20, PRO showed higher CMJ (Δ = 20% and 14%; both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) and SJ (Δ = 19% and 13%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02, respectively), and higher absolute R-TOR and L-TOR during knee extension (Δ = 40% and 58%; both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01). PRO exhibited higher absolute L-TOR and R-TOR during knee flexion than U17 (Δ = 22% and 26%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01, respectively). Between-group differences were not detected in normalized torque, except for knee extension R-TOR (PRO &gt; U17; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Greater differences for quadriceps absolute torque (effect size: 1.37–1.46) were observed in the hamstrings (effect size: 0.30–0.92) between PRO and U17. No differences were found for any H:Q torque ratio, but moderate effect sizes (0.71–0.75) were verified between PRO and the other groups. No differences were found for CMJ:SJ ratio. Conclusions PRO players are more powerful than U17 and U20. Differences in strength level between PRO and U17/U20 are muscle-dependent. The larger strength development of quadriceps over hamstrings can result in lower isometric H:Q torque ratio for PRO.","This paper investigates isometric knee torque and jump performance across different age categories of Brazilian soccer players. The findings reveal that professional players demonstrate significantly higher jump performance and knee extension torque compared to under-17 and under-20 players, suggesting a greater strength development in quadriceps compared to hamstrings among professional athletes."

Energy dissipation during single-leg landing from three heights in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability,2021-12-06,,,,"Inadequate energy dissipation during landing may increase the risk of ankle sprain. Mechanical demands (landing height) in landing tasks may affect the biomechanical differences between individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI). However, energy dissipation strategies during landing from various heights in individuals with CAI are unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of landing height on lower extremity biomechanics between individuals with and without CAI. Eleven participants in each of the CAI and Control group performed a single-leg landing from three heights (30, 40, and 50 cm). We calculated the contribution of each joint to total energy dissipation at 50-ms intervals during 0-200 ms post-initial contact (IC). Peak joint angles and moments and joint stiffnesses were calculated during 0-200 ms post-IC. Two-way mixed analysis of variance revealed significant group-by-height interactions for hip energy dissipation at 101-150 ms post-IC and peak ankle plantarflexion and hip extension moment. These significant interactions suggested that the effects of landing height on the ankle and hip joints differ between individuals with and without CAI. The effect of mechanical demands on altered landing biomechanics among CAI populations should be considered in biomechanical studies and clinical practice.","The paper investigates the differences in energy dissipation during single-leg landings from varying heights in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI), focusing on how landing height influences lower extremity biomechanics. Key findings indicate that mechanical demands affect hip and ankle joint performance differently between the two groups, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches in biomechanical studies and clinical assessments related to ankle instability."
Hip Flexibility and Dynamic Balance Ability in Soccer Players with Functional Ankle Instability,2021-12-03,,,,"The prevention of recurrent ankle sprain and functional ankle instability in soccer players is essential. This study clarified hip joint mobility and dynamic balance ability in soccer players with functional ankle instability. This case–control study included 17 male college soccer players. All participants were assessed using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and were divided into chronic ankle instability (CAI) and non-CAI groups for each of their dominant and nondominant legs. Bilateral passive hip range of motion (ROM) was assessed and the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) was measured for each leg. In the dominant leg, the reach in the posterolateral direction in the CAI group was significantly less than that in the non-CAI group. Hip internal rotation angles in the dominant leg in the CAI group were greater than those in the non-CAI group; however, no significant correlations with the three directions of mSEBT were observed. In the nondominant leg, mSEBT and hip ROMs did not show any significant differences between groups. The dominant leg in soccer players with CAI had poor dynamic balance ability while reaching posterolaterally. However, acquiring hip flexibility may not be necessary to improve the dynamic balance ability. These findings may help develop future research.","This study investigates the relationship between hip flexibility and dynamic balance ability in soccer players with functional ankle instability. It reveals that soccer players with chronic ankle instability (CAI) exhibit poorer dynamic balance in the dominant leg compared to non-CAI players, while suggesting that enhancing hip flexibility may not necessarily improve dynamic balance."
Postural balance and running technique: is there a relationship? Review article,2021-12-02,,,,"Purpose: to determine the existence of a relationship between the development of muscles responsible for postural balance in a person and running efficiency.Research methods. A literature search was carried out using data from Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection and Pub Med. 40 sources were selected for analysis. Preference was given to works published in publications with a Q1 - Q2 rating.Results. Different sports have different requirements for a person's postural stability. The postural balance is of the greatest importance for the representatives of football, hockey, basketball. Running is the basis of many sports. Therefore, the study of postural balance during running loads is the basis for understanding the mechanisms of maintaining dynamic balance. There is currently research showing that jogging alone improves postural balance. It has also been shown that strengthening the muscles responsible for the postural balance of a person increases the stability of walking and running. The dynamic and static postural balance is influenced by aerobic fatigue, as well as accumulated fatigue in the annual training cycle of athletes. Deterioration of the work of the muscles responsible for the postural balance of a person can lead to injuries, diseases, and also limit the achievement of high sports results in running.Conclusions. This is one of the first studies of postural balance in running. In the work, data will be obtained on the positive influence of the development of postural balance (with the use of exercises for strengthening muscles - local stabilizers, balance exercises) on the running technique and the functional state of runners.","This review article investigates the relationship between postural balance and running efficiency, highlighting the significance of postural stability for athletes in sports like football, hockey, and basketball. It emphasizes that strengthening the muscles responsible for postural balance can enhance running performance and reduce the risk of injuries, making it a foundational aspect of athletic training."
Cam morphology is associated with MRI-defined cartilage defects and labral tears: a case–control study of 237 young adult football players with and without hip and groin pain,2021-12-01,,,,"Football players are at risk of developing hip osteoarthritis (OA). Cam morphology (present in almost two of every three football players) may explain this heightened risk, but there is limited research on its role in hip OA development in younger athletes. Knowledge of this relationship will advance our understanding of the aetiology of hip OA in football players. We aimed to study the relationship between cam morphology size and MRI-defined cartilage defects and labral tears, and if this relationship differs by symptomatic state in young adult football players.For this case-control study, 182 (288 hips) symptomatic (hip and/or groin pain >6 months and positive flexion-adduction-internal-rotation (FADIR) test) and 55 (110 hips) pain-free football players (soccer or Australian football) underwent anteroposterior and Dunn 45° radiographs, and 3-Tesla MRI. Cam morphology size was defined using alpha angle, and cartilage defects and labral tears were scored semiquantitatively. Presence, location and score (severity) of cartilage defects and labral tears were determined. Each participant completed the International Hip Outcome Tool 33 and Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score.Greater alpha angle was associated with cartilage defects (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04) and labral tears (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04). Greater alpha angle was associated with superolateral cartilage defects (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05) and superior labral tears (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05). The association of alpha angle with MRI-defined cartilage defects and labral tears was no greater in football players with symptoms than in those without (p=0.189-0.937).Cam morphology size was associated with cartilage defects and labral tears in young adult football players with and without pain. This study provides evidence that cam morphology may contribute to the high prevalence of hip OA in football players. Prospective studies of football players are now needed to establish if cam morphology causes progression of cartilage defects and labral tears and development of hip OA.","This study examines the relationship between cam morphology and the prevalence of MRI-defined cartilage defects and labral tears in young adult football players. The findings indicate that a greater alpha angle, indicative of cam morphology, is associated with these injuries regardless of symptomatic state, suggesting a potential link to the increased risk of hip osteoarthritis in this population."
Fatigue and recovery have different effects on knee biomechanics of drop vertical jump between female collegiate and recreational athletes,2021-12-01,,,,"Abstract Background Although fatigue is known as one of the risk factors for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury, the effects of fatigue and recovery can be different based on the level of competition. However, it is unknown whether female recreational athletes are susceptible to fatigue or not, compared to female collegiate athletes with greater physical activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine and clarify the effects of fatigue and recovery on knee biomechanics of the drop vertical jump (DVJ) in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes. Methods Fifteen female collegiate athletes and ten female recreational athletes were enrolled in the current study. All subjects were basketball players and Tegner activity scales were level 9 and 7, respectively. They performed DVJ before and after the fatigue protocol. Three-dimensional knee kinematics and kinetics were collected during landing phase of DVJ. The data after the fatigue protocol (first, second, and third DVJs) were compared with those before the protocol using one-way repeated measures of analysis of variance in each group. Results Fatigue caused significant increase of knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC) and peak abduction moments within 40 ms from IC in female recreational athletes, whereas no increases of these parameters were observed in female collegiate athletes. Moreover, recovery from fatigue seemed to be more slowly in female recreational athletes than in female collegiate athletes as smaller knee flexion moment was observed even in post-fatigue third DVJ only for female recreational athletes. Conclusions Effects of fatigue on DVJ were significantly greater and continued for a longer duration in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes.","This paper investigates the differing impacts of fatigue and recovery on knee biomechanics during drop vertical jumps in female collegiate versus recreational athletes. The study finds that fatigue significantly increases knee abduction angles and moments in recreational athletes, who also recover more slowly from fatigue compared to collegiate athletes."
Variable Heights Influence Lower Extremity Biomechanics and Reactive Strength Index during Drop Jump: An Experimental Study of Male High Jumpers,2021-11-30,,,,"This study finds the lower limbs' reactive strength index and biomechanical parameters on variable heights.This research aims to reveal the effects of drop height on lower limbs' reactive strength index and biomechanical parameters.Two AMTI force platforms and Vicon motion capture system were used to collect kinematic and dynamic signals of the lower limbs.The drop height had significant effects on peak vertical ground reaction force and peak vertical ground reaction force in the extension phase, lower limbs' support moment, eccentric power of the hip joint, eccentric power of the knee joint, eccentric power of the ankle joint, and concentric power of the hip joint. The drop height had no significant effects on the reactive strength index. Reactive strength index (RSI) had no significant correlations with the personal best of high jumpers. The optimal loading height for the maximum reactive strength index was 0.45 m.The optimal loading height for the reactive strength index can be used for explosive power training and lower extremity injury prevention.","This study investigates the impact of variable drop heights on lower extremity biomechanics and reactive strength index in male high jumpers.

"The effect of bio-banding on the anthropometric, physical fitness and functional movement characteristics of academy soccer players",2021-11-29,,,,"The study examined if maturity status bio-banding reduces within-group variance in anthropometric, physical fitness and functional movement characteristics of 319, under-14 and under-15 players from 19 UK professional soccer academies. Bio-banding reduced the within-bio-banded group variance for anthropometric values, when compared to an aggregated chronological banded group (chronological: 5.1–16.7%CV; bio-banded: 3.0–17.3%CV). Differences between these bio-banded groups ranged from moderate to very large (ES = 0.97 to 2.88). Physical performance variance (chronological: 4.8–24.9%CV; bio-banded: 3.8–26.5%CV) was also reduced with bio-banding compared to chronological aged grouping. However, not to the same extent as anthropometric values with only 68.3% of values reduced across banding methods compared to 92.6% for anthropometric data. Differences between the bio-banded groups physical qualities ranged from trivial to very large (ES = 0.00 to 3.00). The number of functional movement metrics and %CV reduced by bio-banding was lowest within the ‘circa-PHV’ groups (11.1–44.4%). The proportion of players achieving the threshold value score of ≥ 14 for the FMS™ was highest within the ‘post-PHV’ group (50.0–53.7%). The use of maturity status bio-banding can create more homogenous groups which may encourage greater competitive equity. However, findings here support a bio-banding maturity effect hypothesis, whereby maturity status bio-banding has a heightened effect on controlling for characteristics which have a stronger association to biological growth.","This paper investigates the impact of bio-banding based on maturity status on the anthropometric, physical fitness, and functional movement characteristics of young soccer players, revealing that bio-banding leads to reduced variance in anthropometric measures compared to chronological groupings. The findings suggest that bio-banding can create more homogeneous groups, potentially improving competitive equity among players while highlighting its varying effectiveness across different physical qualities and maturity stages."
Varus knee deformity in adolescent soccer players,2021-11-29,,,,"The lower limb axis develops dynamically throughout the first and second decades of life. In recent years, with respect to youth athletes, we have been facing a progressive increase in the intensity of exercise during training and competition (involving increased time, frequency, and power), and, as a result, there hasbeen an increase in the number of acute and chronic overuse injuries. There are some sports with a higher incidence of injuries, one of which is soccer. A review of literature for the past 15 years with a focus on varus knee deformities in adolescent soccer players showed that varus axial deformities of the lower limbsoccur more frequently in soccer players than in the general population and in athletes from other sport, probably due to the specific loading pattern in soccer training. Varus deformities alter knee biomechanics, which results in medial joint space overloading, and consequently an early onset of degenerative joint disease. In addition, bowlegs predisposes athletes to patellofemoral pain syndrome and meniscal lesions. The etiology of genu varum in soccer is thought to be multifactorial, ranging from the natural selection of players to mechanical overload of the proximal medial tibial growth plate. A growing number of clinical reports and animal studies have indicated that intensive sport training may precipitate pathologic changes of the knee joint growth plate, and even produce a growth disturbance.","This paper reviews the prevalence and implications of varus knee deformities in adolescent soccer players, highlighting a significant increase in these deformities due to intensified training loads in soccer. It discusses the biomechanical effects of varus deformities, linking them to a higher likelihood of injuries such as patellofemoral pain syndrome and early degenerative joint disease, while noting the multifactorial etiology of genu varum in this population."
The Potentiating Response to Accentuated Eccentric Loading in Professional Football Players,2021-11-26,,,,"The purpose of this study was to assess the acute effect of Accentuated Eccentric Loading (AEL) on countermovement jump (CMJ) height, peak power output (PPO) and peak velocity in male professional footballers using loads of 20% or 40% of body mass (AEL20 or AEL40, respectively). Twenty-three male professional football players (age 24 ± 4.5 years, range 18-34 years; body mass 80.21 ± 8.4 kg; height 178.26 ± 7.62 cm) took part in a randomised, cross-over design to test the potentiating responses of two AEL conditions (AEL20 and AEL40) versus a body weight control group (CON). Mean loads for the two conditions were 15.84 ± 1.70 kg (AEL20) and 31.67 ± 3.40 kg (AEL40). There was no significant difference between the three conditions for jump height (p = 0.507, η2G = 0.022). There were significant differences in peak power between the groups (p = 0.001, η2G = 0.154). Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment showed significantly higher peak power for both AEL conditions compared to the control group, but no significant differences between AEL conditions (CON vs. AEL20, p = 0.029, 95% CI -1016.735, -41.815, Cohen's d = -0.56; CON vs. AEL40, p = 0.001, 95% CI -1244.995, -270.075, Cohen's d = -0.81; AEL20 vs. AEL40, p = 0.75, 95% CI -715.720, 259.201, Cohen's d = -0.24). There was no significant difference between the three conditions for peak velocity (p = 0.269, η2G = 0.046). AEL using either 20% or 40% of body mass may be used to increase peak power in the countermovement jump in well-trained professional football players.","This study investigates the effects of Accentuated Eccentric Loading (AEL) on countermovement jump performance, specifically focusing on jump height, peak power output, and peak velocity in professional football players. The findings indicate that while AEL enhances peak power compared to a control group, no significant differences were observed in jump height or peak velocity between AEL conditions and control."
Caffeine-carbohydrate mouth-rinsing counter-acts an observed negative effect of mouth-rinsing procedure during sprint-endurance training performance in fasted athletes: A pilot study,2021-11-24,,,,"Carbohydrate mouth-rinsing has been reported to benefit endurance performance in athletes intermittently fasting; however, in the fasted state, the effects of combined caffeine and carbohydrate (CAF-CHO) mouth-rinsing on sprint-endurance performance are unknown. We determined the effects of CAF-CHO mouth-rinsing on kinetics, kinematics, and perceptual measures during a sprint-endurance performance commonly performed by track and field athletes in Muslim athletes fasting during Ramadan. In a randomised and counterbalanced single-blind study, ten national-level male sprinters and sprint/middle-distance runners (21.0 ± 2.0 y) participated in this study. They performed three sprint-endurance sessions on a non-motorised treadmill within the second and third weeks of Ramadan. Each session consisted of 3x15-s all-out sprints, with 2-min active recovery between each sprint. In each session, athletes either did not mouth rinse (NMR), or rinsed with 25 mL of CAF-CHO (4 g carbohydrate, 5 mg caffeine), or a placebo solution (PLA) prior to warm-up (30-min pre-trial), 1-min pre-trial, and mid-way through every recovery period. CAF-CHO maximised total sprint distance relative to NMR (210.3 ± 7.8 vs. 208.7 ± 9.1 m, d = 0.20), whilst counteracted the attenuation following PLA (204.6 ± 8.7 m; d = 0.66). Relative to NMR, CAF-CHO increased perceived activation prior to each sprint (p < 0.05, d = 1.23-2.05). Post-trial perceived exertion was lower for CAF-CHO (d = 0.12) and PLA (d = 0.58) compared to NMR (p > 0.05). Athletes indicated 'no' (50%) or 'unsure' (50%) whether mouth-rinsing would improve performance. The results suggest that CAF-CHO has a potential to optimise, and counter-act the negative effect of mouth-rinsing in Ramadan-fasted Muslims having a negative attitude towards this procedure.","This paper investigates the effects of caffeine-carbohydrate (CAF-CHO) mouth-rinsing on sprint-endurance performance in fasted male athletes during Ramadan. The study finds that CAF-CHO mouth-rinsing enhances total sprint distance and perceived activation compared to no mouth rinsing, while also counteracting any negative effects associated with a placebo."
The effects of a sled push at different loads on 20 metre sprint time in well-trained soccer players,2021-11-24,,,,"This study determined the effects of a single sled push at different loads on sprint performance in competitive male soccer players. Twenty male competitive outfield soccer players (age 19.6±1.3y, body mass 73.6±8.2kg) were split into experimental (n=10) and control groups. In the experimental group, 20m linear sprint time was measured immediately before and 5, 6 and 7minutes after the sled push with either 50 or 100% body mass. The control group performed the 20m sprints only. A repeated measures ANOVA comparing control and experimental groups revealed no effects of time, group or time by group interaction for either experimental condition (all P&gt;0.05). The repeated measures ANOVA compared the experimental conditions revealed effects of time (P=0.034) and group (P=0.002), but not time by group (P&gt;0.05). The effects sizes demonstrated within group effects on sprint time that were small to moderate (-0.26 to 0.71) and trivial to small (-0.31 to 0.09) for the 50% and 100% body mass condition, respectively. These findings demonstrate that a sled push has no significant effect on 20 m sprint time in competitive footballers. If coaches continue to prescribed a sled push before sprinting, a single 15 m push with 50% body mass could have positive benefits.","This study investigates the impact of performing a sled push at different loads on the 20-meter sprint performance of well-trained male soccer players. The results indicate that sled pushes do not significantly affect sprint times, though a single push with 50% body mass may offer some benefits."
Healthcare Data-Based Prediction Algorithm for Potential Knee Joint Injury of Football Players,2021-11-24,,,,"It is important to predict the potential harm to the knee joint in order to prevent football players from inflicting numerous injuries to the knee during activity. Numerous professionals have been drawn to this subject, and many viable prediction systems have been developed. Prediction of potential knee joint injury is critical to effectively avoid knee joint injury during exercise. The current prediction algorithms are mainly implemented through expert interviews, medical reports, and historical documents. The algorithms have problems with low prediction accuracy or precision values. There is a need to understand more knee injury factors and improve the prediction accuracy; hence, the intelligent prediction algorithm for potential injury of knee joints of football players is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the characteristics of the knee joint injury and the injury factors of the football players are gathered and analyzed. Then, the damage is predicted by the similarity measurement. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher prediction accuracy and shorter time. According to the findings of a survey that collected healthcare data, several key factors contribute to football knee injuries. To a degree, this algorithm can predict the likelihood of a football player's knee injury.",This paper presents a prediction algorithm designed to assess the potential for knee joint injuries among football players by analyzing various injury factors. The study highlights the limitations of existing prediction systems and demonstrates that the proposed algorithm offers improved accuracy and efficiency in forecasting knee injury risks based on healthcare data analysis.
Accuracy and Reliability of Inertial Devices for Load Assessment During Flywheel Workout,2021-11-24,,,,"There is currently an increase in inertial flywheel application in strength training; thus, it must be monitored by an accurate and reliable device. The present study tested: (1) the accuracy of an inertial measurement device (IMU) to correctly measure angular velocity and (2) its inter-unit reliability for the measurement of external load. The analysis was performed using Pearson Correlation and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The IMU accuracy was tested using Bland-Altman and the reliability with the coefficient of variation (CV). Ten elite-level football players performed ten series of 5 repetitions in a one-hand standing row exercise (5 series with each arm). A nearly perfect accuracy (ICC=.999) and a very good between-device reliability (Bias=-.010; CV=.017%) was found. IMU is a reliable and valid device to assess angular velocity in inertial flywheel workout objectively.","The paper evaluates the accuracy and reliability of an inertial measurement device (IMU) for assessing angular velocity and external load during flywheel workouts in strength training. Results indicate that the IMU demonstrates nearly perfect accuracy and very good between-device reliability, confirming its effectiveness for objective measurements in athletic training contexts."

Long-term training of young athletes is considered as an integral part of athletes training entire system, subordinated appropriate rules, including focus on higher achievements. In terms of sports training, when there is a long-term body adaptation to physical activity, there are morphofunctional changes in musculoskeletal system state. These changes, which occur directly during physical activity, stored in the body as even after finishing it. Accumulating over a long time period, they gradually lead to compensatory changes formation - somatic dysfunctions. In some cases, musculoskeletal system functional disorders occur during long-term training in certain sports, when training are held without taking into account the anatomical and biomechanical pecularities of the growing young athlete body using a large number of monotonous physical activities. The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in young athletes engaged in various sports is growing steadily. Our research has expanded the understanding of musculoskeletal system functional state of young football players. It was found that normal posture is characteristic of 50% of players aged 11-12 years, and 42, 85% of players aged 12-13 years. In young athletes, the most common musculoskeletal system functional disorder is scoliotic posture, which is found in 26.66% of players aged 11-12 years and 28.57% of players aged 12-13 years. The second detected musculoskeletal system functional disorder in young football players is a round back detected in 16.67% of 11-12 year olds and 17.14% in 12-13 year old athletes. The data obtained indicate the fact that the problem of musculoskeletal system functional disorders in young athletes is more acute than ever. The results obtained supplemented the information base on somatometric indicators of football players aged 11-13.","This paper investigates the morphobiomechanical characteristics of 11-13 year old football players facing functional disorders of the musculoskeletal system, aiming to inform health technologies in athletic training. The study quantifies the prevalence of common postural disorders, such as scoliotic posture and round back, among young athletes, highlighting the increasing occurrence of musculoskeletal issues related to long-term training without considering the anatomical adaptations of growing athletes."
Can We Modify Maximal Speed Running Posture? Implications for Performance and Hamstring Injury Management,2021-11-18,,,,"Sprint kinematics have been linked to hamstring injury and performance. This study aimed to examine if a specific 6-week multimodal intervention, combining lumbopelvic control and unning technique exercises, induced changes in pelvis and lower-limb kinematics at maximal speed and improved sprint performance.Healthy amateur athletes were assigned to a control or intervention group (IG). A sprint test with 3-dimensional kinematic measurements was performed before (PRE) and after (POST) 6 weeks of training. The IG program included 3 weekly sessions integrating coaching, strength and conditioning, and physical therapy approaches (eg, manual therapy, mobility, lumbopelvic control, strength and sprint ""front-side mechanics""-oriented drills).Analyses of variance showed no between-group differences at PRE. At POST, intragroup analyses showed PRE-POST differences for the pelvic (sagittal and frontal planes) and thigh kinematics and improved sprint performance (split times) for the IG only. Specifically, IG showed (1) a lower anterior pelvic tilt during the late swing phase, (2) greater pelvic obliquity on the free-leg side during the early swing phase, (3) higher vertical position of the front-leg knee, (4) an increase in thigh angular velocity and thigh retraction velocity, (5) lower between-knees distance at initial contact, and (6) a shorter ground contact duration. The intergroup analysis revealed disparate effects (possibly to very likely) in the most relevant variables investigated.The 6-week multimodal training program induced clear pelvic and lower-limb kinematic changes during maximal speed sprinting. These alterations may collectively be associated with reduced risk of muscle strain and were concomitant with significant sprint performance improvement.","This study investigates the impact of a 6-week multimodal training intervention on maximal speed running posture, specifically targeting pelvis and lower-limb kinematics among healthy amateur athletes. Key findings indicate that the intervention significantly altered kinematic parameters such as pelvic tilt and thigh velocity, leading to improved sprint performance and potentially reducing the risk of hamstring injuries."
Interval Kicking Program for the Punting and Place-Kicking Athlete: A Systematic Literature Review and Need Analysis,2021-11-18,,,,"Interval programs have been developed for multiple sports, allowing athletes to return to sport-specific activity in a graded fashion, minimizing the risk of reinjury. However, there currently exists a gap in the literature surrounding the use of interval programs for the rehabilitation of punting and place-kicking athletes. We aim to perform a systematic review of the literature examining the use of interval kicking programs to aid punting and place-kicking athletes following a lower-extremity injury. Following PRISMA guidelines, a review was performed using PubMed and MEDLINE databases to evaluate the literature surrounding interval kicking programs for punting and place-kicking athletes. Search terms were combined using Boolean operators of “AND” and “OR”. Articles included in this review met these criteria: 1) included patients with lower-extremity pain/injury, 2) reported a return to sport progressive program, and 3) analyzed the measure’s ability to predict a successful return to sport. The initial search returned 115 articles. Seventy-nine of these articles were excluded after initial screening, leaving 36 full-text articles for final review. Of these final articles, there were no studies outlining the use of interval kicking programs by punting or place-kicking athletes. Of the articles reviewed, the most relevant was an interval kicking program developed by Arundale et al. specifically for the soccer athlete. Punting and place-kicking use biomechanically distinct patterns of movement, warranting a specific interval program. This review identified a gap in knowledge surrounding the use of interval programs in the rehabilitation of punting and place-kicking athletes. This review will now describe what is currently known regarding biomechanics of punting and place kicking, the injuries experienced by these athletes, and the benefit an individualized interval program could provide. There currently exists a gap in the literature surrounding the use of interval programs for the rehabilitation of punting and place-kicking athletes. The biomechanics and application of these skills are distinct, and an interval program designed specifically for these athletes is warranted. Future research should be dedicated to the development, implementation, and analysis of an interval kicking program designed for these athletes.","This paper conducts a systematic review to address the lack of research on interval kicking programs specifically designed for punting and place-kicking athletes recovering from lower-extremity injuries. It identifies a significant gap in current literature regarding appropriate rehabilitation strategies, emphasizing the need for individualized interval programs that consider the unique biomechanical demands of these sports."
Biomechanical Features of Drop Vertical Jump Are Different Among Various Sporting Activities,2021-11-18,,,,"Abstract Background: Risk for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury can be assessed based on drop vertical jump (DVJ). However, biomechanics of DVJ should differ with type of various sporting activities. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether biomechanical features of DVJ are different among various sporting activities in female athletes. Methods: A total of 42 female athletes, including 25 basketball, 8 soccer and 9 volleyball players, participated in the current investigation. DVJ was done for each female athlete using a three-dimensional motion analysis system which consisted of six cameras, two force plates and 46 retro-reflective markers. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded for both limbs in each athlete. Simultaneously, frontal and sagittal plane views of the DVJ were recorded using high-resolution two different video cameras to evaluate Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) score. Three-dimensional biomechanical parameters at the knee joint and LESS were compared among three different sporting activities. Results: Soccer players had better LESS score, compared to basketball players, while no significantly differences were found between basketball and volleyball players in LESS. In addition, peak knee flexion angle was significantly larger, and knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC), peak knee abduction angle, knee internal rotation angle, and knee abduction moment within 40 milliseconds from IC were significantly smaller in soccer players, compared to basketball players. There were no significantly differences between basketball and volleyball players in all biomechanical parameters. Conclusions: From the present study, female basketball and volleyball players have worse LESS score, greater knee abduction angle and moment, compared to female soccer players. Thus, female basketball and volleyball players are likely to have the increased risk of non-contact ACL injury during DVJ, compared to soccer players. DVJ may be useless as a screening tool of non-contact ACL injury for soccer players. Biomechanics of DVJ depends on characteristics of the athlete's primary sport.","The study investigates the biomechanical differences in drop vertical jump (DVJ) among female athletes from basketball, soccer, and volleyball, focusing on the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. It finds that soccer players exhibit better performance scores and safer knee mechanics compared to basketball and volleyball players, indicating a higher risk of ACL injuries for the latter two sports."
"Long-standing pubic-related groin pain in professional academy soccer players: a prospective cohort study on possible risk factors, rehabilitation and return to play",2021-11-17,,,,"Background: Despite being a common overuse entity in youth soccer, scientific data on risk factors, rehabilitation and return to play for long-standing pubic-related groin pain is still rare. The current prospective cohort study aims to evaluate potential risk-factors, propose a criteria-based conservative rehabilitation protocol and assess return-to-play outcomes among professional youth soccer players suffering from long-standing pubic-related groin pain. Methods: Male soccer players with long-standing (> 6 weeks) pubic-related groin pain from a professional soccer club’s youth academy were analyzed for possible risk factors such as age, team (U12 - U23), younger/older age group within the team, position and preinjury Functional movement score. All injured players received a conservative, standardized, supervised, criteria-based, 6-level rehabilitation program. Outcome measures included time to return to play, recurrent groin pain in the follow-up period and clinical results at final follow-up two years after their return to play. Results: A total of 14 out of 189 players developed long-standing pubic-related groin pain in the 2017/2018 season (incidence 7.4%). The average age of the players at the time of the injury was 16.1 ± 1.9 years. Risk factor analysis revealed a significant influence of the age group within the team (p =.007). Only players in the younger age group were affected by long-standing pubic-related groin pain, mainly in the first part of the season. Injured players successfully returned to play after an average period of 135.3 ± 83.9 days. Only one player experienced a recurrence of nonspecific symptoms (7.1%) within the follow-up period. The outcome at the 24-month follow-up was excellent for all 14 players. Conclusions: Long-standing pubic-related groin pain is an overuse entity with a markedly high prevalence in youth soccer players, resulting in a relevant loss of time in training and match play. In particular, the youngest players in each team are at an elevated risk. Applying a criteria-based rehabilitation protocol resulted in an excellent return-to-play rate, with a very low probability of recurrence. Trial registration: The trial was retrospectively registered under DRKS00016510 in the German Clinical Trials Register on 19.04.2021.","The paper investigates the prevalence and risk factors associated with long-standing pubic-related groin pain in youth soccer players, highlighting the higher susceptibility of younger age groups. It also introduces a standardized rehabilitation protocol that significantly enhances return-to-play outcomes, showing a low recurrence rate of symptoms after treatment."
"Three Main Mechanisms Characterize Medial Collateral Ligament Injuries in Professional Male Soccer—Blow to the Knee, Contact to the Leg or Foot, and Sliding: Video Analysis of 37 Consecutive Injuries",2021-11-16,,,,"To describe the mechanisms, situational patterns, and biomechanics (kinematics) of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries in professional male soccer players.Case series.Fifty-seven consecutive MCL injuries across 2 seasons of professional soccer matches were identified. We obtained and reviewed 37 of 57 (65%) injury videos to establish the injury mechanism, situational pattern, and knee flexion angle. We used detailed biomechanical analysis to assess the indirect and noncontact injuries. Injury layoff times, timing of injuries during the match, and location of the injuries on the pitch were also reported.Twenty-three (62%) injuries were direct contact, 9 (24%) were indirect contact, and 5 (14%) were noncontact. Three main sprain mechanisms were noted: (1) direct contact/blow to the knee (n = 16), (2) contact to the leg or foot (lever like) (n = 7), and (3) sliding (n = 9). Seventy-three percent of MCL injuries occurred during 2 main situations: (1) pressing/tackling (n = 14, 38%) and (2) being tackled (n = 13, 35%). For indirect and noncontact injuries, knee valgus loading (100% of cases), hip abduction (73% of cases), and external foot rotation (92% of cases) were prominent injury kinematics, often with lateral trunk tilt (median, 10°; 64% of cases) and rotation (64% of cases). Knee flexion angles were higher for indirect and noncontact injuries (median, 100°) than for direct-contact injuries (median, 22°; P<.01).Nearly two thirds of MCL injuries occurred after direct contact; 1 in every 4 MCL injuries occurred after indirect contact. Three sprain mechanisms characterized MCL injuries: (1) blow to the knee, (2) contact to the leg or foot (lever like), and (3) sliding. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2021;51(12):611-618.

It’s not all about power: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing sex-based differences in kicking biomechanics in soccer,2021-11-16,,,,"Kicking is fundamental in many field-based sports. Most studies investigating kicking performance have been conducted with male athletes, resulting in a dearth of specific data to inform coaching of this skill in female players. This systematic review aimed to compare kicking biomechanics in male and female athletes in field-based sports. As per PRISMA guidelines, articles were retrieved from searches across five online databases. Studies investigating kicking biomechanics in field-based athletes of both sexes were eligible for inclusion. Articles were screened using Covidence and data extracted based on STROBE recommendations. The review included 23 studies, featuring 455 soccer players. Male athletes produced significantly greater ball velocities and linear velocities of the ankle, foot, and toe than females. Males had greater ankle plantarflexion angles than females at ball strike, while females used larger trunk flexion ranges than males. Hip and knee torques and ball-to-foot velocity ratios were greater in men than women. Skilled players generated power using tension arcs; a technique not seen in novices. Skill level within sex may have a greater influence on kicking performance than differences between the sexes. This review highlights the need for further research investigating kicking performance in both sexes across the spectrum of sports.","This systematic review compares kicking biomechanics between male and female soccer players, addressing a gap in research that has predominantly focused on male athletes. Key findings indicate that males exhibit superior ball velocities and specific biomechanical characteristics, while the influence of skill level within each sex may surpass that of sex-based differences."
Effects of a preparatory training protocol on the movement and body stability of handball players,2021-11-16,,,,"Handball is a sport with a high risk of injury, The prevalence of injury is only obtainable through a thorough and comprehensive analysis. One of the most commonly used test batteries for interpreting the characteristics of an injury is the Functional Movement Screen (FMSTM). It makes possible to possible to identify movement limitations and asymmetries which are believed to impact injury risk in sports. The aim of this study is to use the FMSTM to determine whether an eight-week training protocol can predict and prevent injuries in handball. The study sample comprised the fifteen members of the Borac handball club youth team. The initial measurement showed that most players (80%) had an overall score in the test battery ranging from 15 to 20 points. In addition, three players were found to have asymmetry. Only one of the three players had an overall score in the FMSTM of ≤14. The participants scored the lowest in the initial measurement for Rotary Stability, followed by Deep Squat and Hurdle Step Left. They scored the highest in the Shoulder Mobility. After the implementation of the exercise protocol for improving body mobility and stability, the final measurements showed that all the participants had an overall score in the FMSTM of &gt;14. The value of eta squared showed that training in between the two measurements had a significant impact. At the time of testing and protocol implementation no players sustained any injuries during matches or in training. This study confirmed that the FMSTM can be used to predict injuries in sports.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of an eight-week training protocol aimed at improving movement and body stability in handball players, utilizing the Functional Movement Screen (FMSTM) to assess injury risk.

Methodological implications of adapting and applying a web-based questionnaire on health problems to adolescent football players,2021-11-15,,,,"Abstract Background The Oslo Sport Trauma Research Centre Questionnaire on Health Problems (OSTRC-H) has become a popular tool to monitor health status in athletes. Originally developed for adult athletes, the tool is today also being used in adolescent athletes. However, little is known on the suitability of the questionnaire for the adolescent age group and the methodological implications of applying the tool to prospectively monitor illness and injury. To address this gap in methodological knowledge, the aim of this study is to outline and discuss the adaption and application process of the OSTRC-H to adolescent football players. Method The adaption process included a slightly modified back-translation method to translate the questionnaire. The application process included a web-based version of the Swedish OSTRC-H sent out once a week over 23 weeks to 115 adolescent football players aged 10-19 attending two football schools in Sweden. The response rate and prevalence of health problems over 23 weeks were calculated as feasibility indicators. Additionally, comprehensibility questions were added to the questionnaire in the end of the study. Result No major disagreement was found between the original and translated versions of the questionnaire. However, significant changes to the wording of the questions and answer categories were necessary to adapt it to adolescents. A visual body figure was also added. The average weekly response rate was 38% (SD 13.5). To increase this rate, questionnaire data was gathered retrospectively through telephone and email contact with the participants and their parents, elevating the response rate to 53% (SD 15.5). The adolescents experienced the questionnaire as easy to understand and to cover all relevant health problems. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the importance of adapting the questionnaire to the adolescent target group through translation, pre-tests, adjustments of wording and the facilitation of answering the questionnaire using a visual body figure. The study further shows the importance of keeping close and personal contact with the participants, their parents, teachers, and coaches throughout data collection. Future studies should take into account the age group and study context when adapting and applying the OSTRC-H to adolescents.","This paper focuses on the adaptation and application of the Oslo Sport Trauma Research Centre Questionnaire on Health Problems (OSTRC-H) for use with adolescent football players.

5-A-SIDE SOCCER: PREVALENCE OF SPORTS INJURIES IN BRAZILIAN TEAM PLAYERS,2021-11-15,,,,"ABSTRACT Introduction: 5-a-side soccer is a sports modality exclusively for athletes with vision impairment (VI) classified as blind - B1 (Blind 1) by the visual classification process. Type of impairment and high-performance training are factors that contribute to the development of sports injuries. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the prevalence of sports-related injuries in visually disabled athletes of the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer team. Methods: The method was defined as a descriptive, longitudinal, epidemiological study. The sample was composed of ten male athletes, members of the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer team, including two athletes without VI and eight athletes with the B1 visual classification, who participated in competitions in 2014. The questionnaire for the data collection was based on the Sport Injuries Protocol for Paralympic Sports (PLEEP), expressing quantitative data analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: The results showed that, in 2014, five athletes with VI had seven sports injuries, with a prevalence of 62.5%, clinical incidence of 0.87 injuries per athlete per year, and 1.4 injuries per injured athlete. The main sports injuries were muscle strain (28.6%), groin pull (athletic pubalgia) (28.6%), and shin splints (periostitis) (28.6%). All sports injuries occurred in the lower limbs, affecting legs (71.4%) and hips (28.6%). Overload was the most frequent mechanism (57%), reported after the technical kick movement and linked to the muscle imbalance between dominant and supporting lower limbs, in addition to the postural misalignment typical of people with visual impairments. Conclusions: In summary, the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer athletes presented a pattern of overload injuries resulting from the repetition of the technical kick movement, occurring predominantly in sports competitions. Epidemiological data can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent injuries in this sport. Level of evidence II, Progressive prognostic study.","This study analyzes the prevalence of sports injuries among visually impaired athletes in the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer team. The findings indicate a significant occurrence of overload injuries, particularly in the lower limbs, linked to the technical kick movement and muscle imbalances typical in this population, which can inform injury prevention strategies."
"Changes in muscle coactivation during running: a comparison between two techniques, forefoot vs rearfoot",2021-11-15,,,,"Introduction: Surface electromyography has been a technique used to describe muscle activity during running. However, there is little literature that analyses the behaviour of muscle coactivation in runners, describing the effect between two techniques associated with the initial contact, such as the use of rearfoot (RF) and forefoot (FF). Material and method: The purpose of this study was to compare muscle coactivation levels developed in the lower limb during two running techniques, FF vs RF. Fourteen amateur runners were evaluated (eight men, six women; age= 23.21 ± 3.58 years, mass= 63.89 ± 8.13 kg, height= 1.68 ± 0.08m). Surface electromyography was used to measure muscle activity during both running techniques evaluated on a treadmill, considering the muscle pairs: Rectus femoris- Biceps femoris (RFe-BF), Lateral Gastrocnemius–Tibialis Anterior (LG-TA), and Medial Gastrocnemius - Tibialis Anterior (MG-TA). These were calculated in three windows considering ten running cycles (0-5%, 80-100%, and 0-100%). To compare FF vs RF t-student test for paired data was used. Results: It was observed significant differences in the MG-TA pair (FF= 18.42 ± 11.84% vs RF = 39.05 ± 13.28%, p = 0.0018 during 0-5%, and RFe-BF pair (FF = 42.38 ± 18.11% vs RF = 28.37 ± 17.2%, p = 0.0331) during 80-100% of the race. Conclusion: Our findings show that the behaviour of muscle coactivation is different between FF vs RF techniques if we analyze little windows in the running cycle. This could be associated with an increase in the joint stability between these short intervals, represented in the initial and final regions of the running cycle.","This paper investigates the differences in muscle coactivation levels between two running techniques: forefoot (FF) and rearfoot (RF). The study finds significant variations in muscle coactivation between the techniques, suggesting that these differences may enhance joint stability at specific points in the running cycle."
Optimal mechanical force‐velocity profile for sprint acceleration performance,2021-11-14,,,,"The aim was to determine the respective influences of sprinting maximal power output ( PHmax ) and mechanical Force-velocity (F-v) profile (ie, ratio between horizontal force production capacities at low and high velocities) on sprint acceleration performance. A macroscopic biomechanical model using an inverse dynamics approach applied to the athlete's center of mass during running acceleration was developed to express the time to cover a given distance as a mathematical function of PHmax and F-v profile. Simulations showed that sprint acceleration performance depends mainly on PHmax , but also on the F-v profile, with the existence of an individual optimal F-v profile corresponding, for a given PHmax , to the best balance between force production capacities at low and high velocities. This individual optimal profile depends on PHmax and sprint distance: the lower the sprint distance, the more the optimal F-v profile is oriented to force capabilities and vice versa. When applying this model to the data of 231 athletes from very different sports, differences between optimal and actual F-v profile were observed and depend more on the variability in the optimal F-v profile between sprint distances than on the interindividual variability in F-v profiles. For a given sprint distance, acceleration performance (<30 m) mainly depends on PHmax and slightly on the difference between optimal and actual F-v profile, the weight of each variable changing with sprint distance. Sprint acceleration performance is determined by both maximization of the horizontal power output capabilities and the optimization of the mechanical F-v profile of sprint propulsion.","This paper investigates the relationship between maximal power output (PHmax) and the mechanical force-velocity (F-v) profile on sprint acceleration performance. It highlights that while sprint acceleration is primarily influenced by PHmax, individual optimal F-v profiles, which change with sprint distance, also play a crucial role in performance."
CAPACITY OF REPEATED SPRINTS AND AEROBIC POWER IN SOCCER PLAYERS,2021-11-14,,,,"Of the determining factors for the performance of soccer players, the ability to support high-intensity actions followed by or with a short recovery interval are the most demanded in a soccer game.Thus, authors state that such recovery is directly linked to the supply of oxygen supplied to the metabolic systems during the recovery interval, however, little is known about the physiological mechanisms.Goal: The aim of this study is to verify the relationship between the ability to maintain speed in high-intensity actions (Capacity for Repeated Sprints or CSR) and aerobic power in soccer players.Methods: 14 athletes from the under-15 category were evaluated (172,3±5,8 cm; 66,4±8,3 kg) of a club from the A2 series of the Paulista Championship in two field tests, one to measure the maximum aerobic power (Max.VO₂.) and another that aimed to measure the capacity of repeated sprints (CSR).Results: There was no significant correlation (r=-0.45) between the PMA variables (Max.VO₂.) and the fatigue index (CSR), thus showing that one ability does not influence the development of the other.","The paper investigates the relationship between the capacity for repeated sprints (CSR) and aerobic power (Max.VO₂) in soccer players, focusing on the critical role of quick recovery during high-intensity actions in games. The study found no significant correlation between CSR and aerobic power, indicating that improvements in one do not necessarily enhance the other in the athletes tested."
The burden of injuries according to maturity status and timing: A two‐decade study with 110 growth curves in an elite football academy,2021-11-12,,,,"Injuries have a negative impact on the development of football players. Maturation is a potential risk factor for football injuries but available data on this topic provide limited evidence due to methodological shortcomings. The aim of this study was to describe the injury burden of male academy football players according to growth curve-derived maturity status and timing. Injury and growth data were collected from 2000 to 2020. Longitudinal height records for 110 individual players were fitted with the Super-Imposition by Translation and Rotation model to estimate age at peak height velocity (PHV). Players were clustered according to maturity status (pre-, circa-, post-PHV, or adults) and timing (early, on-time, late maturers). Overall and specific injury burdens (days lost/player-season) and rate ratios for comparisons between groups were calculated. Overall injury burden increased with advanced maturity status; pre-PHV players had 3.2-, 3.7-, and 5.5-times lower burden compared with circa-PHV, post-PHV, and adult players, respectively. Growth-related injuries were more burdensome circa-PHV, while muscle and joint/ligament injuries had a higher impact post-PHV and in adults. Further, in the pre-PHV period, late maturers showed lower burden of overall, growth-related, anterior inferior iliac spine osteochondrosis, and knee joint/ligament injuries compared with on-time maturers. In adult players, however, injuries were less burdensome for early maturers than on-time and late maturers. In addition, joint/ligament injuries of adult late maturers were 4.5-times more burdensome than those of early maturers. Therefore, monitoring maturity seems crucial to define each player's maturation profile and facilitate design of targeted injury prevention programmes.Highlights Injury burden is significantly lower in football players at pre-peak height velocity (PHV). Growth-related injuries are most burdensome circa-PHV, while muscle and joint/ligament injuries are more burdensome post-PHV and especially in adults.Before PHV, growth-related and knee joint/ligament injuries have lower burden in players who mature late than those who mature on-time. Adult late maturers have greater burden of overall and joint/ligament injuries than early maturers.Football academies should regularly assess the maturity status and timing of young football players, as the impact of injuries varies with maturation status and timing.Management of the maturity-related injury risk profile, in combination with other relevant factors (training load, neuromuscular and biomechanical factors, physiotherapy, coaching, communication, psychosocial factors …), might help improve the success of player development programmes and protect the health of young football players.","This study investigates the relationship between maturation status and injury burden in elite male football academy players over two decades. It finds that the injury burden increases with higher maturity status and varies by maturation timing, highlighting the need for regular assessment of players' maturity to inform targeted injury prevention strategies."
Systematic Review of Cost-Effectiveness of Injury Prevention Interventions in Soccer—Evidence Why Health Agencies Should Address It,2021-11-12,,,,"Soccer injuries are a recognized problem worldwide. Several injury prevention programs have been confirmed to reduce the number of injuries in female and male players. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data about their cost, burden, and benefit for the health care system. In this paper we aim to systematically review the literature and critically evaluate the economic quality of injury prevention interventions implemented across different populations of soccer players. Web of Science, Medline, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, and other databases were searched from January 2011 through July 2021. Research articles were only selected for analysis if they focused on the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention, were experimental papers written in English, and were published following the peer-review process. Three cluster RCT and one retrospective study met the criteria. Cost data on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. The included studies had a good/average quality of economic evaluation. Based on ICERs, injury prevention interventions were cost-effective in three out of the three comparisons. One study did not report the ICER value. However, since economic analyses were reported with varying methodological approaches and results, more data are required to recognize the cost-effectiveness of soccer-specific injury prevention interventions and their benefit for the health care system.","This paper systematically reviews the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention interventions in soccer, highlighting the economic evaluation of various programs designed to reduce injuries in male and female players. The findings indicate that while most studies assessed were cost-effective, there is a need for more standardized economic analyses to better understand the benefits for the healthcare system."
The Effect of Exercise Intervention on Disability and Kinesiophobia in a Retired Athlete With Old Patella Fracture: A Case Report,2021-11-12,,,,"Objectives: To evaluate the effect of exercise intervention on disability, pain, and kinesiophobia in a retired athlete with old patella fracture. Methods: A 34-year-old retired football player with old patella fracture conducted the exercise intervention for 12 weeks, 1 h each time, three times a week. the retired football player completed the Lysholm Knee Score (LKS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) were measured at pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention.

High cognitive demand tasks may detect mild alterations in executive functions in American football players: A pilot study,2021-11-12,,,,"Background: Repeated head trauma associated with sports activities can cause subtle cognitive alterations in amateur players, but these are difficult to detect.Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to determine if there is an association between executive functions performance and different sports practice variables in a sample of amateur American football players.Methods: A pilot transversal study with amateur American football male players without previous neurological or psychiatric illnesses, drug abuse, or consumption of psychotropic medications were carried out and evaluated executive functions performance using automated test.In addition, the levels of stress, impulsivity, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were evaluated, as well as multiple variables related to sports practice such as previous concussions, time of sports practice, weekly training time, and position within the game.Results: Fourteen men players were assessed, with an average age of 20.57(standard deviation [SD] ± 1.61) years, played 7 (50%) in an offensive position, 7 (50%) in defensive position, and 3 (21%) presented previous sport-related brain trauma.The average time of practice football was of 35.07 (SD ± 43.10) months, starting age of football playing 17.71 (SD ± 3.64), and hours of training during the week 5.75 (SD ± 2.83).There was no association between cognitive performance and any sports practice variable, however, the offensive position showed significant association with impairments in the highest span of visual working memory task (β = 0.53, SE = 0.16, p = 0.001). Conclusion:The results suggest that executive tasks with high cognitive demand may reveal alterations in the short term in amateur American football players.","This pilot study investigates the relationship between executive function performance and various sports practice variables in amateur American football players. The findings indicate that while no general associations were observed between cognitive performance and sports practice variables, players in offensive positions exhibited significant impairments in visual working memory tasks, suggesting that high cognitive demand tasks may uncover subtle cognitive alterations related to head trauma in this population."
Can small-sided games assess the training-induced aerobic adaptations in elite football players?,2021-11-10,,,,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not SSGs could be used to evaluate the aerobic fitness status and the longitudinal training-induced adaptations in football players. Additionally, the capacity of SSGs to recreate the official match demands was investigated.Twenty-five elite football players were monitored. Total distance (TD), high-speed running, very high-speed running, sprint and accelerations plus decelerations distance were measured during 20 SSGs formats and 25 official-matches; in SSGs, average heart rate was also collected. During submaximal Yo-Yo test, heart rate at peak exercise, heart rate post-60s recovery and rate of perceived exertion were collected. Coefficient of variation, interclass correlation-coefficient and correlation-coefficient analysis were used to calculate validity, reliability, construct validity and, internal and external responsiveness of SSGs demands.In SSGs, a small variability (~6.0%) with moderate reliability (~0.542 to ~0.663) was found in TD and heart rate, while a high variability (~20.8% to ~60.3%) with poor to moderate reliability (~0.358 to ~0.605) was observed in the other metrics; in submaximal Yo-Yo, heart rate showed small variability (~3.7%) with good reliability (~0.933 to ~0.916). The SSGs demands showed poor internal and external responsiveness (P>0.05) to the training-induced aerobic adaptations as assessed by submaximal Yo-Yo. The construct validity of SSGs showed overall large to very large correlations (r=0.53 to 0.90, P<0.05) between SSGs and official match demands across the season.SSGs should not replace standardized field tests to detect the training-induced aerobic adaptations. However, SSGs could be confidently used to recreate specific contextual factors in elite football players.","This study investigates the effectiveness of small-sided games (SSGs) in assessing aerobic fitness and training-induced adaptations in elite football players. While SSGs can replicate match demands and show some reliability, they should not replace standardized tests for evaluating aerobic adaptations due to their limited responsiveness in this area."
Which assessments are used to analyze neuromuscular control by electromyography after an anterior cruciate ligament injury to determine readiness to return to sports? A systematic review,2021-11-08,,,,"Abstract Background Adequate neuromuscular control of the knee could be one element to prevent secondary injuries after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. To assess neuromuscular control in terms of time, amplitude and activity, electromyography (EMG) is used. However, it is unclear which assessments using EMG could be used for a safe return to sports (RTS). Therefore, we aimed to summarize EMG-related assessments for neuromuscular control of the knee in adult patients after an ACL injury to decide upon readiness for RTS. Methods This systematic review followed guidelines of Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane recommendations. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), SPORTDiscus and the Web of Science were searched from inception to March 2019 and updated in November 2020. Studies identifying electromyographic assessments for neuromuscular control during dynamic tasks in adult, physically active patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury were eligible and qualitatively synthesized. Two independent reviewers used a modified Downs and Black checklist to assess risk of bias of included studies. Results From initially 1388 hits, 38 mainly cross-sectional, case-controlled studies were included for qualitative analysis. Most studies provided EMG outcomes of thigh muscles during jumping, running or squatting. Outcomes measures described neuromuscular control of the knee in domains of time, amplitude or activity. Risk of bias was medium to high due to an unclear description of participants and prior interventions, confounding factors and incompletely reported results. Conclusions Despite a wide range of EMG outcome measures for neuromuscular control, none was used to decide upon return to sports in these patients. Additional studies are needed to define readiness towards RTS by assessing neuromuscular control in adult ACL patients with EMG. Further research should aim at finding reliable and valid, EMG-related variables to be used as diagnostic tool for neuromuscular control. Moreover, future studies should aim at more homogenous groups including adequately matched healthy subjects, evaluate gender separately and use sport-specific tasks. Registration The protocol for this systematic review was indexed beforehand in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and registered as CRD42019122188.","This systematic review focuses on the assessments of neuromuscular control through electromyography (EMG) in adult patients after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to determine readiness for return to sports. The review highlights that while various EMG outcomes related to thigh muscle activity during dynamic tasks exist, none currently provide sufficient criteria for deciding safe return to sports, indicating a need for further research to establish reliable assessment tools."
Effects of plyometric jump training versus power training using free weights on measures of physical fitness in youth male soccer players,2021-11-08,,,,"This study aimed to contrast the effects of power training (PT) and plyometric-jump-training (PJT) programmes on measures of physical fitness in prepubertal male soccer players. Thirty-three participants were randomly allocated to PT group (n = 11), PJT group (n = 11), and an active control group (CG; n = 11). Before and after 12 weeks of training, tests were performed for the assessment of sprint-speed , change-of-direction (CoD) speed, muscular strength , and aerobic-endurance (AE). Findings indicated significant group×time interaction effects for all sprint-speed intervals, CoD speed, AE, and strength (d = 0.20–0.32). Post-hoc analyses revealed significant, moderate-to-large improvements in all sprint-speed intervals, CoD speed, AE, and muscle strength following PT (ES = 0.71 to 1.38). The PJT induced significant, moderate-to-large enhancements in 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m sprint, CoD speed, and AE (ES = 0.51 to 0.96) with no significant changes for 5 m sprint-speed and muscle strength (ES = 0.71 and 0.16, respectively). No significant pre-post changes were observed for the CG . Overall, PT and PJT are effective means to improve various measures of physical fitness in prepubertal male soccer players. Notably, to additionally improve acceleration and muscle strength, PT has an advantage over PJT.","This paper compares the effects of plyometric jump training (PJT) and power training (PT) on the physical fitness of prepubertal male soccer players. Findings indicate that both training methods significantly enhance sprint speed, change-of-direction speed, muscular strength, and aerobic endurance, with PT showing greater improvements in acceleration and strength compared to PJT."
Sex-Based Differences in the Drop Vertical Jump as Revealed by Video Motion Capture Analysis Using Artificial Intelligence,2021-11-01,,,,"Sex-based biomechanical differences during a drop vertical jump (DVJ) may explain the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury in females. Video motion capture using artificial intelligence (VMocap) is a new method for accurate motion analysis.To use VMocap to identify sex-based differences in biomechanics during a DVJ in Asian athletes.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 63 female and 61 male Asian soccer players volunteered for this study in 2018. Participants performed a bilateral DVJ using VMocap, and the knee valgus angle (KVA), knee flexion angle (KFA), hip flexion angle (HFA), and lower leg anterior inclination angle (LAIA) were calculated from the motion capture data. These joint angles and inclination angles were evaluated at the time of highest point of the first jump (H1), initial contact (IC), maximum knee flexion (MKF), toe-off (TO), and highest point of the second jump (H2). The unpaired t test was used to compare sex-based differences.At H1, the KVA in females showed more valgus (-2.9° vs -5.4°) and the LAIA in females was greater (29.1° vs 25.7°) versus males (P < .01 for both). At IC, the KVA in females showed more valgus (-1.3° vs -3.0°) and females had a greater KFA (20.8° vs 14.3°) and LAIA (5.1° vs 0.0°) compared with males (P < .01 for all). At MKF, female KVA showed more valgus (6.2° vs -9.5°), and females had greater LAIA (36.6° vs 34.6°), smaller KFA (77.5° vs 87.5°), and smaller HFA (55.8° vs 82.0°) compared with males (P < .01 for all). At TO, female KVA showed more valgus (-0.7° vs -3.1°) and female KFA, HFA, and LAIA were greater (31.7° vs 19.2°; 19.9° vs 16.4°; and 18.2° vs 11.5°, respectively) than males (P < .01 for all). At H2, females had a greater KFA (18.6° vs 14.6°) and LAIA (13.3° vs 9.9°) than males (P < .04 for both).Asian female soccer players showed increased KVA and LAIA, decreased KFA and HFA at MKF, and increased KFA at IC and TO compared with their male counterparts in this analysis of the DVJ.Elucidation of kinematic differences between the sexes can aid in predicting injuries.","This paper investigates sex-based differences in biomechanical variables during the drop vertical jump (DVJ) in Asian soccer players, utilizing video motion capture with artificial intelligence. Key findings indicate that females exhibit increased knee valgus angles and lower leg anterior inclination angles compared to males, providing insights that may help predict injury risks, particularly for anterior cruciate ligament injuries in women."
046 The mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in male professional football players in the middle east: a systematic video analysis of 15 cases,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> While effective programmes to prevent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury have been established, it is important that programme design, consistent with the van Mechelen model, is based on the specific injury mechanisms, representative of the region and playing conditions. Presently, no such data exist for professional football players competing in the Middle East. <h3>Objective</h3> To describe the mechanisms of ACL injury in male professional football players in the Qatar Star League (QSL) based on systematic video analysis. <h3>Design</h3> Systematic video analysis of prospective injury surveillance data. <h3>Setting</h3> Male professional football in Qatar. <h3>Participants</h3> Fifteen professional male football players in the QSL, who sustained an ACL injury in a match during the seasons 2013/2014 through 2018/2019. <h3>Assessment of injury mechanisms</h3> Injuries were recorded through the Aspetar Injury Surveillance Programme and high definition broadcast videos were analyzed (49 views; 34 slow motion). Five analysts independently described the injury mechanisms in detail (situation, behavior, biomechanical characteristics), using validated observational tools (Walden et al. 2015). <h3>Results</h3> A knee valgus mechanism was observed in 10 cases (1 with direct contact to the knee, 3 with contact to other body part and 6 with no body contact), no valgus was observed in 2 cases (both direct knee contact), while 3 were unclear. Of the 12 non-contact/indirect-contact situations, we saw 4 main categories of injury situations (multiple combinations were possible): pressing (n=6), tackling or to be tackled by another player (n=4), blocking (n=3) and screening (n=2). In the 3 direct contact injuries, the player was tackling in 2 cases and being tackled by another player in 1 case. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Only 20% of match ACL injuries were contact injuries. Knee valgus was consistently observed, independent of the playing situation. Pressing was the main mechanism leading to injury. Landing after heading was not observed in any of these injuries.","This paper investigates the mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in male professional football players in Qatar through systematic video analysis of 15 cases. The findings indicate that knee valgus is a common mechanism in ACL injuries, primarily occurring during pressing situations, with a notable prevalence of non-contact scenarios."
310 The effect of a 90-min soccer match and fatigue on eccentric hamstring strength: implications for hamstring injury risk,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Hamstring injury (HI) is the most prevalent muscle injury in both amateur (van Beijsterveldt et al., 2015) and professional (Ekstrand et al., 2011; Hawkins et al., 2001) soccer (football) players. Worryingly, the annual incidence of HI increased by 2.4% annually between 2010 and 2014 (Ekstrand et al., 2016) <h3>Setting</h3> Professional football. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Twenty-two semi-professional football players (Mean ± SD: Age: 19.3 ± 2.9 year; Height 185.0 ± 8.7 cm; Body Mass 81.6 ± 6.7 kg) participated in this study. <h3>Design</h3> All players were right dominant (defined as their preferred 'kicking' leg). Subjects were included in the study if they were not injured or rehabilitating from an injury at the time of testing. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> The eccentric hamstring strength of players was examined using the Nordbord (Vald Performance, Queensland, Australia) device prior to soccer match and immediately following 90 minutes of football friendly match.The season period of the research project was the second half of the season. <h3>Results</h3> There was a significant difference of moderate effect in eccentric strength before a match (M = 306.91, SD = 59.26) compared and to after the match (mean = 277.77 ± SD = 60.35 p =.000, Cohen's d = .50) (table 1). The eccentric force before training (mean = 306.91 ±SD = 59.26) and after training (M = 277.77, SD = 60.35 demonstrated a significant moderate effect(p =.000, Cohen's d = .50). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Etiological risk factors attributed to an increased risk of muscular injury include poor muscular strength, particularly eccentric strength deficits, and ipsilateral muscular strength imbalances. Resistance to fatigue and eccentric strength, particularly at high speeds should be given greater consideration in conditioning for soccer. The small number of participants limits the global generalization of our findings. However, this limitation is tempered by the inclusion of professional players in our study.","The paper investigates the impact of a 90-minute soccer match on the eccentric hamstring strength of semi-professional football players and its implications for hamstring injury risk. It finds a significant decline in eccentric strength post-match, highlighting the importance of enhancing muscular strength and resistance to fatigue in soccer training to mitigate injury risks."

Totally, 461 potential references recorded through Endnote and imported. Out of the 117 potential titles and abstracts screened by two independent researchers through Covidence, 54 full-text assessed for eligibility of which, 28 were included. Quality of studies and risk of bias were then assessed. <h3>Results</h3> Studies carried out in 4 continents and 14 countries while recruiting female and male players aging range from 9 to 30. These indicate that the 11+ has been investigated worldwide. Quality of studies was moderate to high and except an unclear amount of bias for blinding outcome assessment; risk of bias for all domains was low. Excepting lower extremity stability, ankle evertors time latency and proprioception improvement, application of the 11+ at long-term (a complete football season) appeared to be successful in improving a variety of performance tests e.g. agility, sprinting, balance, jumping, cutting maneuvers etc; physiological responses and a majority of biomechanical measures. Vice versa, that the 11+ causes acute negative impact on the physical performance and technical abilities compared to the dynamic warm ups was highlighted in two studies. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Application of the 11+ as warm up routine during trainings at long-term with higher adherence can be recommended for improving performance. However, caution must be observed while recruiting the 11+ for warming up before competitions as it may acutely decrease physical performance and technical abilities. Given the contradictory nature of the literature, further studies should evaluate short-term effects of the programme.","This paper systematically reviews the effects of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention programme on football performance, highlighting its impact on agility, sprinting, balance, and various biomechanical measures. While the programme shows long-term benefits for performance, caution is advised regarding its use before competitions due to potential acute negative effects on physical performance and technical abilities."

However, limitations, in terms of methodological deficits, small sample size, and in some cases, laboratory setting, are reasons for future research to place greater importance on reducing the risk of bias to increase the reliability and validity of study results.","This paper conducts a systematic review to analyze athletic injuries, biomechanical factors, and sports performance in amputee soccer. It reveals that while amputee soccer has a low injury risk and specific biomechanical advantages associated with crutch use, further research is needed due to methodological limitations in existing studies."
050 Do non-elite soccer teams implement neuromuscular training to prevent non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries?,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Soccer is one of the highest risk sports for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. These injuries have serious long-term consequences and cause substantial socio-economic costs. The preventive effect of an exercise program is highly dependent on its components and the level of compliance. In Belgium, it is unknown whether non-elite soccer teams implement neuromuscular training to prevent ACL injuries. <h3>Objective</h3> Is preventive neuromuscular training incorporated during practice in non-elite Belgian soccer? <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Non-elite soccer teams. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Twelve hundred and five athletes (86 teams) and 799 female athletes (78 teams), aged between 18 and 35, participated to this study. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Survey data of athletes were collected twice during the season 2014–2015 (male athletes) and season 2015–2016 (female athletes). <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Using an online survey (www.letselpreventie.be), information concerning type, duration and frequency of implemented exercises or barriers to neuromuscular training during the preseason and season were gathered. <h3>Results</h3> During the preseason, only 12% of the athletes indicated to perform balance exercises (jump-landing) and plyometric exercises with a frequency of two sessions per week and a duration of at least 10 minutes per exercise. During the season, this percentage was reduced to 4%. Fifty-five to 77% (preseason) and 65 to 82% (season) of the athletes respectively indicate not to perform any neuromuscular training at all. Most important barriers to neuromuscular training were: 'I don't need it', 'I have no time', 'stretching and warming-up are sufficient' and 'I don't know which exercises to perform'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Most non-elite soccer teams do not implement neuromuscular training for preventing ACL injuries. These results highlight the need for educating coaches and athletes to implement neuromuscular training during practice.","This paper investigates the implementation of neuromuscular training among non-elite soccer teams in Belgium to prevent non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The findings show a significantly low uptake of such training, with major barriers identified as a lack of perceived need, time constraints, and inadequate knowledge about exercises, emphasizing the need for increased education for coaches and athletes."
423 Prevalence and burden of health problems in top-level football referees,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Top-level football referees make decisions during strenuous physical activity and often under great mental pressure. Despite their central role in a football match, little is known about referees' health problems, particularly female referees. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the prevalence and burden of health problems in female and male top-level football referees. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Female and male referees from the Norwegian female and male top divisions. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> All top-level referees (n=55) were included in this study. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Referees reported health problems (injuries and illnesses) through text messages for 49 weeks using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Questionnaire on Health Problems (OSTRC-H2). <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Prevalence of all health problems. <h3>Results</h3> On average, 34% (95% CI 31–36%) of referees reported at least one health problem each week, and 20% (95% CI 19–22%) reported substantial health problems. The compliance was 98.1%. The injury incidence was 3 injuries per athlete-year (95% CI 2.5 to 3.5) and 12 injuries per 1000 match hours (95% CI 7 to 19). Gradual-onset injuries were most prevalent, with an average weekly prevalence of 23%, and caused the greatest absence from training and matches (60% of total time loss). Of the 156 reported injuries, 36% were related to the lower-leg and foot. Illnesses represented a small portion of the overall burden of health problems. Female referees reported more health problems than male referees, and on-field referees reported more health problems than assistant referees. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Top- level referees reported a high prevalence of health problems during one full season. Gradual onset injuries to the lower-leg and foot represented the highest injury burden, especially in female referees.","This paper investigates the prevalence and burden of health issues among top-level football referees, focusing on both male and female officials. The study finds that a significant percentage of referees report health problems, with a high incidence of gradual-onset injuries, particularly in the lower leg and foot, and highlights that female referees experience more health issues than their male counterparts."
052 Kinematic and neuromuscular predictors of failed landings during unanticipated drop-jumps: implications for injury prevention,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Despite the link between jump landings and ACL injury risk, limited research has investigated the biomechanical and neuromuscular differences between successful and failed landings. Identifying the factors that lead to failed landings may provide specific targets for injury prevention programs. <h3>Objective</h3> Identify which neuromuscular and biomechanical variables predict success or failure during unanticipated drop-jump landings. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Controlled laboratory setting. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Thirty-two healthy male (n=16; 15.9±1.87 yrs.) and female (15.7±1.7 yrs.) Ottawa area competitive athletes with no history of major musculoskeletal injury affecting functional performance. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Participants completed single-leg drop-jump landings from a platform aligned to their tibial plateau. The landing leg was randomly signalled during flight via a projector in front of the participant. The landings were then categorized as 'successful' or 'failed' (defined as any loss of balance forcing the participant to adjust their base of support during landing). <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Sex, limb dominance, joint angles and excursions, and muscle excitation amplitudes during the flight phase of the drop-jumps were extracted. These variables were normalized, reduced and submitted to a logistic regression. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-nine variables were reduced to a seven variable logistic regression model that included trunk and pelvis lateral tilt, pelvis internal rotation, hip abduction, trunk and pelvis joint excursion, and biceps femoris muscle excitation. Using these variable the model correctly classified 74% of the landings. The same variables are present for both males and females. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Regardless of sex, an athlete who presents the identified movement and control patterns during the flight phase risks a failed landing, potentially increasing the risk of injury. Typical prophylactic interventions focus on landing characteristics. This research indicates for the first time that modifying what occurs prior to landing is critical and must be addressed through training.","This paper investigates the kinematic and neuromuscular predictors of failed landings during unanticipated drop-jumps and their implications for injury prevention. The study identifies key variables—such as trunk and pelvis tilt, joint excursions, and muscle excitation—that can help predict landing success or failure, emphasizing the need for training interventions that focus on pre-landing mechanics."

400 Longitudinal changes in cutting kinematics in young female athletes across puberty,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Young female athletes involved in high-speed cutting and change-of-direction sports are particularly susceptible to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Little is known if maturational changes in cutting technique contribute to the increased injury risk. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine longitudinal changes in cutting kinematics in female athletes as they matured through puberty. <h3>Design</h3> Longitudinal cohort study <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanics laboratory <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> One-hundred and seventy-two healthy high-school athletes were tested while in at least two different pubertal stages (pre-, mid-, post-pubertal). <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Trunk, hip, and knee sagittal, frontal and transverse plane range-of-motion, peak angles, and angles at initial-contact during an unanticipated 45° cut measured with a laboratory-based optoelectronic motion capture system. Pubertal stages were defined by Tanner Stages. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Changes in trunk, hip, and knee kinematics as girls mature across puberty (pre-to-midpubertal, pre-to-postpubertal, mid-to-postpubertal). <h3>Results</h3> As girls matured through puberty, they displayed a decrease in sagittal-plane hip (1.6–4.4°, p≤0.01) and knee range-of-motion (ROM) (2.7–2.9°, p≤0.01), and decreased peak hip (2.9–3.2°, p≤0.02) and knee flexion angles (2.5–2.9°, p≤0.01), which is indicative of greater quadriceps dominance. Peak knee abduction angles also increased as girls progressed through puberty (0.9–1.4°, p≤0.006), suggesting greater ligament dominance. In terms of trunk dominance, there were mixed findings with a decrease in trunk frontal- (2.5–5.7°, p&lt;0.01) and sagittal-plane ROM (1.4–2.0°, p≤0.05), but an increase in trunk transverse-plane ROM (2.8–3.6°, p≤0.01) observed as girls mature. Other significant changes in cutting technique were decreased peak trunk flexion (3.8–7.8°, p≤0.01), and decreased hip flexion (2.9–3.3°, p≤0.01) and knee flexion angles (2.0–3.0°, p≤0.02) at initial contact, suggesting a more upright and stiffer cutting posture. <h3>Conclusions</h3> As girls mature through puberty, they display a change in cutting strategy characterized by greater quadriceps and ligament dominance. Ameliorating these kinematic changes throughout maturation may further reduce ACL injuries in this high-risk group.","This paper examines the longitudinal changes in cutting kinematics in young female athletes as they progress through puberty and aims to determine if these changes contribute to the injury risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Key findings indicate a shift towards greater quadriceps and ligament dominance in cutting technique, alongside significant alterations in trunk, hip, and knee kinematics, which may inform strategies to mitigate ACL injury risk in this population."
308 Increased acute exposure to soccer ball heading shows no response from biochemical markers for axonal injury,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> There is limited research quantifying the response of biochemical markers for axonal injury to an acute bout of soccer heading, especially when individual impact biomechanics are considered, and overall heading dose manipulated. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate if individual impact biomechanics or different heading doses affect the reaction of serum neurofilament light (NF-L). <h3>Design</h3> Randomized control trial. <h3>Setting</h3> Laboratory study. <h3>Participants</h3> Forty-four male university students with no history of head injury and currently not active in head-impact sports, randomly split into a control group (n=8), 10 (n=12), 20 (n=12) or 40-header group (n=12). <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Blood samples were taken at baseline, then six hours, 24-hours and 7-days post heading. After baseline samples, participants completed either 10, 20 or 40 headers whilst impact biomechanics were quantified using a three-dimensional motion capture system sampling at 1000Hz. NF-L was quantified using Quanterix NF-L assay kit on the Simoa HD-1 Platform. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> NF-L concentrations, cumulative linear and cumulative angular head acceleration. For NF-L concentrations, time, group and interaction effects were assessed via mixed-effects ANOVA. The relationship between cumulative linear and angular head accelerations and percentage change in NF-L across timepoints was assessed via Pearson product moment correlations. <h3>Results</h3> There were no significant time, group or interaction effects for NF-L. There was no significant relationships between cumulative linear or angular head accelerations and percentage change of NF-L at any timepoint. At 6hrs, 24hr and 7-days post heading, control group showed 61.8%, 41.7% and 30% NF-L change from baseline respectively; 10 header group 30%, -0.6% and 15.2% change respectively, 20 header group -2.6%, -3.2% and 7.4% change respectively, and 40 header group 18.6%, 33.5% and 29.6% change respectively. Large inter-individual variation in NF-L response was observed. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Individual impact biomechanics or increasing heading doses did not effect NF-L response. Further study is required to evaluate chronic loading effects of heading that also considers individual impact biomechanics.","This paper investigates the impact of acute soccer ball heading on biochemical markers for axonal injury, specifically focusing on serum neurofilament light (NF-L) levels in relation to individual impact biomechanics and varying heading doses. The study finds no significant changes in NF-L concentrations or correlations with cumulative head accelerations across different groups and timepoints, indicating that heading dose and individual biomechanics do not elicit a measurable biochemical response."
290 Surveillance: injury incidence and injury patterns in professional football players registered in Egyptian football league,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Injury surveillance is an important pre-requisite for injury prevention planning. There is lack of information about injuries, rates, patterns and the procedures used for injury prevention of football players in the professional Egyptian soccer league. <h3>Objective</h3> To record and describe the injury incidence and characteristics in male professional football participating in Egyptian football league by using a club based injury surveillance system. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective study, where a random of 6 governors among 27 different governors existing in Egypt were selected and including all participating with man first team at footbal Egyptian league. <h3>Setting</h3> Any injury detected for athletes in the first male team of professional football Egyptian league that were registered in Egyptian Football federation was recorded with its characteristics and methods of management . <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> 42 different teams including 928 players that were followed during season 2017- 2018. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Data collection was difficult as this was the first serveillance done so we used direct contact with athletes by Facebook messenger, WattsApp and phone calls as well as club surveillance sheets. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Injury incidence rates and characteristics. <h3>Results</h3> 2869 injuries occurred during 441 hours of exposure, giving an injury incidence of 8.4 injuries/1,000 hours. The injury incidence during matches was higher than in training. The most common injury recorded was thigh strain (310 injuries), representing 17% of all injuries. Ankle sprain was second common injury recorded (180 injuries). Meniscal injuries recorded were (126) injuries while ACL injuries recorded were (77 injuries) Re-injuries constituted 13% of all injuries The incidence of match injuries showed an increasing injury tendency over time in both the first and second halves. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This is the first recorded surveillance for injury detection of football professional athletes recorded and published in Egypt. We need more studies and establishing injury prevention programs and implementing them with more injury surveillance in the future.","This paper presents the first recorded surveillance of injury incidence and patterns among professional football players in the Egyptian football league during the 2017-2018 season. The study highlights that a total of 2,869 injuries were recorded, with the highest incidence occurring during matches, and emphasizes the need for further research and the establishment of injury prevention programs."
202 Variables associated with knee valgus in male soccer players during a single leg vertical landing task,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Knee valgus during landing and cutting situations has been described as the main biomechanical risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Evidence support the influence of hip strength and biomechanics on knee valgus in female athletes. To develop specific preventive measures for males, it is important to understand biomechanical and musculoskeletal variables associated with this mechanism during activities that mimic ACL injuries. <h3>Objective</h3> To test the correlation between peak knee valgus during a single-leg vertical jump-landing task, and biomechanical and musculoskeletal variables in male soccer professional athletes. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanics laboratory. <h3>Participants</h3> Twenty-four healthy male professional soccer players. <h3>Interventions</h3> Participants performed a vertical jump-landing task during the pre-season. Kinematic data were collected using an 8 high-speed cameras motion analysis system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) with a sample rate of 250 Hz. Maximal isometric hip strength was tested using a hand-held dynamometer and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was measured using a digital inclinometer. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Predictor variables were lateral trunk lean, hip adduction and internal rotation, hip extensors, abductor and external rotator isometric strength, and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. Interest variables were peak knee valgus during the landing task. Association between predictors and interest variables were tested using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (alpha = 0.05). <h3>Results</h3> Lateral trunk lean (r =0.43, p=0.04) and hip internal rotation (r =-0.68, p&lt;0.01) showed significant correlation with peak knee valgus during the vertical landing task. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Trunk position seems to influence the ACL mechanism, possibly by increasing knee abduction moment related to the lateral displacement of centre of mass during lateral trunk lean. The negative correlation between hip internal rotation and knee valgus in males is opposite to the results usually described for females, and may be related to the different influence of hip on ACL injury mechanism between sexes.","The paper investigates the correlation between knee valgus during a vertical landing task and various biomechanical and musculoskeletal variables in male soccer players, aiming to identify factors that may aid in preventing ACL injuries. Significant correlations were found between lateral trunk lean and hip internal rotation with peak knee valgus, highlighting the differing biomechanics between male and female athletes in relation to ACL injury mechanisms."
236 Anthropometrics and knee dynamic valgus as explanatory factors for landing kinetics and ACL injury risk: a female football cohort study,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Due to the devastating impact of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has on the female athlete´s career, anthropometrics and biomechanics-related risk factor screenings have been widely designed. However, the relation of aberrant movement patterns and other anthropometrical variables still remains controversial. <h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to analyse if lower limb anthropometrics and knee kinematics could explain landing kinetics during a drop jump maneuver, as primary ACL injury risk factors in a female football environment. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cross-sectional descriptive study. Testing methodology was settled inside an anatomical, biomechanical and functional conditioning risk factor screening. Data collection was made during the pre-season period. <h3>Setting</h3> 4 different teams from the region of the Basque Country (Spain). 2 youth second teams and 2 senior teams competing in the Spanish second division. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> 64 youth female football players (age 20,32±4,9). Every available (non-injured) athlete was included. No lost participants during the data collection. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Pelvic width and femur length were measured as anthropometrical gold variables. Knee valgus kinematics and landing kinetics during the bilateral and unilateral drop jump were registered. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Knee valgus kinematic data (femur-tibia angle &lt;180°) was captured by a video analysis tracker software. Landing kinetics were registered using inertial sensor unit technology. <h3>Results</h3> There was a little correlation (<i>r</i>=0,303) between landing peak VGRF and knee valgus kinematics, at p = 0,01 significance level, and also with the femur length (<i>r</i>=-0,338). In addition, the linear regression analysis showed that the pelvic width, femur length and knee valgus kinematics explained in 89,1% (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>) the landing kinetics results (<i>p</i>=&lt;0,05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> A moderate significance level between lower limb anthropometrics, knee valgus kinematics and landing kinetics was the main finding at the present study. More exhaustive surveillance screening re-tests are needed in order to detect the main contributors for ACL injury mechanics in a female football context.","The paper investigates the relationship between lower limb anthropometrics, knee kinematics, and landing kinetics as risk factors for ACL injury in female football players. It finds a moderate correlation between these anthropometric variables and landing kinetics, suggesting that pelvic width, femur length, and knee valgus kinematics significantly influence injury risk during landing maneuvers."
047 Soccer players who rupture their ACL demonstrate biomechanical risk factors while decelerating: a prospective cohort study,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Many non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries amongst women's soccer players occur during a deceleration manoeuvre. Retrospective video analysis of ACL injuries has demonstrated that players are often in knee valgus at the time of injury. Whether the components of valgus collapse: hip adduction, hip internal rotation, and knee abduction angles during a deceleration task, differ between players who go on to ACL injury has not been prospectively examined. In order to develop more effective injury prevention programs, it is necessary to understand these risk factors in the context of a sport-specific task. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare whether hip and knee kinematics during a deceleration differ between collegiate women's soccer players who go on to sustain ACL injury and those who don't. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort non-randomized intervention study. <h3>Setting</h3> Collegiate women's soccer. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> 51 collegiate women's soccer players. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Preseason, three-dimensional motion analysis of a deceleration. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Descriptive statistics for injured limbs and the mean of uninjured players' limbs were calculated for peak values of valgus collapse components (hip adduction, hip internal rotation, knee abduction). A MANOVA was also used to determine whether there were biomechanical differences between Injured (N=4) and Uninjured (N=47) players. <h3>Results</h3> There was a significant difference between groups for hip adduction angle (p=0.03). The Injured players were in much more hip adduction (8.63±4.1°) than those who remained Uninjured (1.66±6.0°). There were no other significant or clinically meaningful differences between groups for hip internal rotation or knee abduction angle. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hip adduction during deceleration differed between players who went on to ACL injury and those who did not. Therefore, the components of knee injury prevention programs that address lateral and posterior hip strength and neuromuscular control are likely crucial components of ACL injury prevention programing for soccer players.","The paper investigates the biomechanical risk factors associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries during deceleration in collegiate women's soccer players. It finds significant differences in hip adduction angles between players who suffered ACL injuries and those who did not, emphasizing the need for targeted injury prevention programs addressing hip strength and neuromuscular control."
401 Bone bruise pattern and mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament injury in professional football players: correlation between MRI and video analysis,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> The presence of bone bruises (BB), especially in the lateral compartment of the knee, is a common finding in the context of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, different patterns have been described and a precise correlation with mechanism of ACL injury has never been determined. <h3>Objective</h3> To correlate the MRI features of ACL injuries with the exact injury mechanism obtained from video-analysis. Such investigation, which has never been performed up to now, provides relevant insights in the understanding ACL injury mechanism and in the genesis of intra-articular lesions such as bone bruises. <h3>Design</h3> Fifteen professional football players sustaining an ACL injury (while playing during an official match of First League Championship) were included in the study. The video of injury was obtained from the Television broadcast. Knee Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was obtained within 7 days from the injury. BB and meniscal/cartilage lesions were analyzed on MRI, while a video analysis of mechanisms of ACL injury and injury dynamics were assessed from the videos. <h3>Results</h3> The most common pattern of BB present in 8 cases (53%) was a femoral BB &gt;5 mm in the central portion of the lateral femoral condyle and in the posterior portion of the lateral tibial plateau. In all these cases, the injury occurred with single-leg load during a pivoting maneuver while changing direction during pressing (33%), dribbling (7%), goalkeeping (7%) or in response of being being tackled on the upper body (7%). All these injuries occurred without direct contact, high horizontal speed and with an abducted hip. Other patterns included BB only in tibia (20%), tibia and femur BB &lt;5 mm (7%) or no BB (20%). In these cases, injury occurred due to direct contact (20%), recovery balance after kicking (13%) or jumping (7%), and while tackling (7%). <h3>Conclusions</h3> A characteristic and well-defined BB pattern, with BB in both tibia and femur, was identified in ACL injuries without direct contact and while the football players had single-leg loading while pivoting trying to perform a sudden change of direction.","The paper investigates the relationship between MRI findings of bone bruises and the mechanisms behind anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in professional football players using video analysis. It identifies specific patterns of bone bruising associated with different injury mechanisms, highlighting that most injuries occurred during non-contact pivoting maneuvers while changing direction."
443 Injuries among football goalkeepers: risk factors and injury prevention program – a systematic review,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Previous studies have confirmed different localization of injuries in football goalkeepers (FG) compared to outfield players. However, there is a lack of systematic data regarding the injury epidemiology and potential injury prevention programs that might be implemented in this unique group of players. <h3>Objective</h3> 1) To analyze the type and localization of injuries among FG and what are the associated risk factors for these injuries 2) To verify whether there is any injury prevention program tailored for FG. <h3>Design</h3> Systematic review of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library electronic databases (search strategy available via the PROSPERO database; 2020 CRD42020183296). <h3>Setting</h3> Any football competition level. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> The study population consisted of both sexes of amateur or professional FG. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Any paper addressing the issue of injury incidence and/or prevalence and describing injury prevention program/warm-up tailored for goalkeepers. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Type of injuries, localization of injuries, types of injury prevention programs, injury incidence (injuries/1000 training or match-play hours), percentage distribution of injury type, percentage distribution of injury localization. <h3>Results</h3> Our searches identified 813 potentially relevant articles. By reviewing titles and abstracts, we identified 52 potential articles examining type and localization, and risk factors of injuries amongst FG, and biomechanical effects of applying injury prevention accessories (e.g., shorts, pads, etc.). There were no original scientific papers reporting the effectiveness of any tailored injury prevention programs implemented in a FG population. However, there was one short communication published as an abstract, confirming significant reductions in the total number of the upper extremity injuries following the application of FIFA 11+ program (RR=0.42 [0.31–0.56]; p&lt;0.00001, NNT-5.1]. <h3>Conclusions</h3> More investigations are needed to develop and evaluate effectiveness of injury prevention strategies tailored for FG.","This systematic review examines the incidence and localization of injuries among football goalkeepers, identifying key risk factors and the lack of tailored injury prevention programs. The findings underscore the need for further research to develop effective strategies for injury prevention in this unique player group."
206 A dynamic warm up programme reduces knee and ankle injuries among youth male sub-elite football players,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Dynamic exercises appear to be more practical in preventing football-related injuries. <h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate effects of a dynamic warm up programme including dynamic stretch, strength and plyometric exercises (DSP) on prevention of injuries. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective non-randomized controlled trial. <h3>Setting</h3> Competitive level. <h3>Interventions</h3> Two volunteer teams of Iranian U21 league were assigned to control (n=29,18.5±1.2) and DSP (n=25,18.7±1.5) groups. Over a football season (2018), the DSP performed the specific warm up lasting 15 min three times weekly with a progression of intensities over time. The control group followed its routine warm up including football drills and physical warm ups without a specific prevention approach. Injuries and time exposure were recorded according to the FIFA consensus statement. Data were analysed by Chi-Square Test while the level of significant was set as p ≤0.05. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Injury incidence and risk ratio for ankle and knee. <h3>Results</h3> In total, 7020 h of training and competition and 37 lower extremity injuries were recorded; about 65% in the control group. The injury incidence for DSP and control were 1.8 and 3.4 respectively. Incidences of knee and ankle injuries for DSP and control were 1.0, 0.9, 2.3 and 1.3, respectively. The risk ratio for knee and ankle injuries was higher in the control group by 2.3 and 1.5 times, respectively. Chi-square testing indicated a significantly lower knee injury incidence for the DSP group (p=0.03). Despite a 30% lower injury incidence, the difference of ankle injuries between the groups was not significant (p=0.52). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Applying DSP as regular warm up significantly reduced the incidence of knee injuries in youth footballers, which is assumed to be due to a better stimulation of the control mechanisms of the postural system followed by performing the programme. For the ankle, exercises that are more specific should be applied though the limited small sample size may also affect the results.","The paper evaluates the effectiveness of a dynamic warm-up program, consisting of dynamic stretch, strength, and plyometric exercises, in reducing knee and ankle injuries among youth male sub-elite football players. Results indicate that the dynamic warm-up significantly reduced the incidence of knee injuries while showing no significant difference for ankle injuries compared to the control group, suggesting a need for more specific ankle injury prevention exercises."

Injury incidence was higher in females (0.20 per 1000 player-hours, 95% CI 0.12–0.33, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=92%; 0.07 per 1000 player-exposures, 95% CI 0.04–0.14, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=98%) than males (0.08 per 1000 player-hours, 95% CI 0.04–0.14, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=94%; 0.05 per 1000 player-exposures, 95% CI 0.03–0.08, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=97%). Injury incidence during competition was much higher (0.53 per 1000 player-hours, 95% CI 0.35–0.81, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=80%; 0.35 per 1000 player-exposures, 95% CI 0.17–0.71, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=96%) than training (0.03 per 1000 player-hours (95% CI 0.02–0.05, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=60%; 0.02 per 1000 player-exposures, 95% CI 0.01–0.05, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=86%). Heterogeneity between studies was generally high. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Non-contact ACL injuries represented over half of all ACL injuries sustained. The proportion of non-contact to total ACL injuries and injury incidence were higher in females than males. Injuries mostly occurred in competition settings. More research is required to fully understand the influence of sport, age group, and participation level on injury proportion and incidence. difficult.","This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the epidemiology of non-contact ACL injuries in team ball sports, analyzing 2,748 injuries across various player demographics and exposure types. The findings reveal that non-contact injuries account for over 50% of all ACL injuries, with higher incidence rates observed in females compared to males, particularly during competitive play."
199 Gender differences in landing mechanics after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Studies have reported that females and males exhibit different landing techniques. However, few studies have examined the effect of gender on landing technique in athletes following ACLR. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare landing technique between females and males following ACLR during landing from heading-jump (LHJ) and landing from long-jump (LLJ). <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanical laboratory. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Eight female and 8 male recreational athletes. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> LHJ included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force plates, whereas LLJ included jumping forward and landing on the force plates. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> A 2×2 ANOVA (gender × landing) was performed to evaluate kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography data. <h3>Results</h3> A significant interaction was found only for knee flexion angles (F1,14= 12.67, p = 0.003). Pairwise comparisons showed that males landed with decreased knee flexion compared with females during LLJ (p = 0.01). LHJ showed decreased knee flexion compared with LLJ in females (p &lt; 0.001) and males (p = 0.001). Significant main effects of landing were found. LHJ showed decreased hip flexion angles (F1,14= 71.07, p &lt; 0.001), decreased knee flexion angles (F1,14= 95.17, p &lt; 0.001), decreased knee extension moments (F1,14= 20.12, p = 0.001), and decreased plantarflexion moments (F1,14= 34.71, p &lt; 0.001). Also, a significant main effect of gender for hip flexion was found showing that males landed with decreased hip flexion angles (F1,14= 7.17, p = 0.01). <h3>Conclusions</h3> LHJ showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with LLJ. Females and males following ACLR showed nearly similar landing biomechanics. However, males landed with smaller hip and knee flexion angles (stiff-landing); therefore, preventative training programs may focus on improving the use of hip and knee joints (soft-landing) during landing to decrease the risk of consequent injuries in males following ACLR.","This paper investigates the gender differences in landing mechanics of recreational athletes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) during specific jumping and landing tasks. It finds that while males and females exhibit similar landing biomechanics, males demonstrate significantly less knee and hip flexion during landings, highlighting the need for targeted training programs to mitigate injury risks in males post-ACLR."
194 Risk factors for graft rupture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a systematic review with meta-analysis,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Underlying factors contributing to increased risk of graft rupture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are not well described. <h3>Objective</h3> To systematically review intrinsic risk factors for sustaining a graft rupture. <h3>Design</h3> A systematic review with meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Sport Discus) were searched from inception to January 2020. Meta-analyses (random effect model) were performed and expressed as odds ratios (OR). <h3>Setting</h3> The included studies describe a variety of sport settings and activity levels. <h3>Participants</h3> The review comprises studies including males and/or females of any age who have had ACLR. <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> All longitudinal studies investigating any intrinsic risk factor for future graft rupture were included. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Graft rupture. <h3>Results</h3> Seventy-seven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. The following factors all independently increased the odds of sustaining a graft rupture after ACLR: Age ≤ 18 years (OR: 3.87, 95% CI: 2.32–6.46), higher pre-primary injury activity level (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.56–3.82), family history of ACL injury (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.50–2.62), returning to a high activity level (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.11–3.15), and increased lateral tibial slope (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13–2,38). None of the following factors were found to be associated with future graft rupture; sex, smoking status, generalized joint laxity, timing of surgery or return to sport (RTS), playing soccer compared to other sports, hop performance at time of RTS or concomitant meniscal or collateral ligament injuries. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Young age, family history of ACL injury, high tibial slope and previous and current high activity level should be considered when screening for increased risk of graft rupture following ACLR. Future studies on the possible role of sensorimotor factors, e.g., muscle activation and/or strength and proprioception for future graft ruptures are warranted.","This paper systematically reviews intrinsic risk factors associated with graft rupture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using meta-analysis across various sports. Key findings indicate that younger age, a higher pre-injury activity level, family history of ACL injury, returning to high activity levels, and an increased lateral tibial slope independently elevate the odds of graft rupture, while factors such as sex and timing of surgery show no correlation."
Analysis of Single Leg Squat and Single Leg Landing Performance Variability among Professional Soccer Players Across a Season,2021-11-01,,,,"This study investigated the performance variability between limb type (dominant versus non-dominant leg) with regard to time (over season with three categories: pre-, start-and end-season) of professional soccer players.Methods: A total of 88 out of 124 male soccer players aged 16-30 years were asked to perform the specific athletic tasks single leg squat (SLS) and single leg landing (SLL) during different times in a full sports season.These functional tasks were evaluated using outcome measures of coefficient of variation, including frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) and hip adduction angle (HAA).Results: No significant difference was observed across all events between the dominant and non-dominant leg of the participants between screening sessions over time, for both SLS and SLL functional activities, except for one event in both second-order coefficient of variation for FFPA (FPPA V2) and HAA in SLS (at the start of season, p =0.006).The variations in FPPA and HA are clinically irrelevant, as no statistically significant differences were observed between limb types (dominant versus non-dominant leg) between screening sessions over a season, thereby suggesting that the performance variability is fairly consistent over time. Conclusions:There is consistency across the sports season in the performance variability of SLS and SLL.","This study examines the performance variability of single leg squat (SLS) and single leg landing (SLL) tasks among professional soccer players throughout a season, focusing on differences between dominant and non-dominant legs. The findings indicate that there are no significant differences in performance variability over time, suggesting a consistent level of performance across the season."
471 The force experienced by the head during football heading is mainly influenced by the speed of the ball rather than its mechanical properties,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> There are growing concerns about the risk of neurodegenerative diseases associated with heading in football. It is essential to understand the biomechanics of football heading to guide player protection strategies to reduce the severity of the impact. <h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to assess the effect of football speed, mass and stiffness on the forces experienced during football heading using mathematical and human body computational model simulations. <h3>Design</h3> Computational biomechanics study. <h3>Setting</h3> N/A. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> N/A. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Football headers were reconstructed using a human body modelling approach. Simulations were run by independently varying the football mass, speed and stiffness. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Peak contact force experienced by the head was extracted from each simulation. <h3>Results</h3> Mathematical and human body computational model simulations indicate that the force experienced by the head was directly proportional to the speed of the ball and directly proportional to the square root of the ball stiffness and mass. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Over the practical range of ball speed, mass and stiffness, the force experienced by the head during football heading is mainly influenced by the speed of the ball rather than its mass or stiffness. The findings suggest that it would be more beneficial to develop player protection strategies that aim to reduce the speed at which the ball is travelling when headed by a player. Law changes reducing high ball speeds could be trialled at certain age grades or as a phased introduction to football heading.","This paper investigates the forces experienced by the head during football heading, emphasizing the influence of ball speed over its mechanical properties, such as mass and stiffness. The study utilizes computational models to demonstrate that reducing ball speed could be a more effective player protection strategy against potential neurodegenerative risks associated with heading."
Validity and Reliability of an Inertial Sensor Device for Specific Running Patterns in Soccer,2021-10-31,,,,"Electronic performance tracking devices are largely employed in team sports to monitor performance and improve training. To date, global positioning system (GPS) based devices are those mainly used in soccer training. The aim of this study was to analyse the validity and reliability of the inertial sensor device (ISD) in monitoring distance and speed in a soccer-specific circuit and how their performance compare to a GPS system. 44 young male soccer players (age: 14.9 ± 1.1, range 9-16, years, height: 1.65 ± 0.10 m, body mass: 56.3 ± 8.9 kg) playing in a non-professional soccer team in Italy, participated in the study. We assessed the players trough a soccer running sport-specific circuit. An ISD and a GPS were used to assess distance and speed. Data was compared to a video reference system, and the difference were quantified by means of the root mean square error (RMSE). Significant differences were found for both GPS and ISD devices for distance and speed. However, lower error for distance (dRMSE 2.23 ± 1.01 m and 5.75 ± 1.50 m, respectively) and speed (sRMSE 0.588 ± 0.152 m·s-1 and 1.30 ± 0.422 m·s-1, respectively) were attained by the ISD compared to the GPS. Overall, our results revealed a statistically significant difference between systems in data monitoring for either distance and speed. However, results of this study showed that a smaller error was obtained with the ISD than the GPS device. Despite caution is warranted within the interpretation of these results, we observed a better practical applicability of the ISD due to its small size, lower cost and the possibility to use the device indoor.","The paper investigates the validity and reliability of an inertial sensor device (ISD) compared to traditional GPS devices for monitoring distance and speed during soccer-specific running patterns. The findings indicate that the ISD demonstrates lower error rates in measuring these parameters, suggesting it may be a more practical and cost-effective option for performance tracking in soccer."
"The effect of two retraining programs, barefoot running vs increasing cadence, on kinematic parameters: A randomized controlled trial",2021-10-30,,,,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two 10-week non-laboratory-based running retraining programs on foot kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters in recreational runners. One hundred and three recreational runners (30 ± 7.2 years old, 39% females) were randomly assigned to either: a barefoot retraining group (BAR) with 3 sessions/week over 10 weeks, a cadence retraining group (CAD) who increased cadence by 10% again with 3 sessions/week over 10 weeks and a control group (CON) who did not perform any retraining. The footstrike pattern, footstrike angle (FSA), and spatial-temporal variables at comfortable and high speeds were measured using 2D/3D photogrammetry and a floor-based photocell system. A 3 × 2 ANOVA was used to compare between the groups and 2 time points. The FSA significantly reduced at the comfortable speed by 5.81° for BAR (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.749) and 4.81° for CAD (p = 0.002; Cohen's d = 0.638), and at high speed by 6.54° for BAR (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.753) and by 4.71° for CAD (p = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.623). The cadence significantly increased by 2% in the CAD group (p = 0.015; Cohen's d = 0.344) at comfortable speed and the BAR group showed a 1.7% increase at high speed. BAR and CAD retraining programs showed a moderate effect for reducing FSA and rearfoot prevalence, and a small effect for increasing cadence. Both offer low-cost and feasible tools for gait modification within recreational runners in clinical scenarios.","This study investigates the impact of two different 10-week running retraining programs—barefoot running and increased cadence—on the kinematic parameters of recreational runners. The findings indicate that both retraining approaches effectively reduced footstrike angle and demonstrated moderate changes in gait mechanics, suggesting their potential as practical interventions for improving running form in non-professional athletes."
Development of a Cost-effective Biomechanical System for the Assessment of Kinematic and Kinetic Parameters in Soccer Players During a Lower Limb Pointing Task,2021-10-28,,,,"<title>Abstract</title> PurposeThe main aim of the present study was to describe the development of a non-commercial biomechanical system designed for the simultaneous measurement of kinematic and kinetic parameters during a lower limb pointing task. The task was performed by two groups of soccer players (10 novices and 10 experts, aged 16-19 years) and the differences between the two groups, in terms of these parameters, were also assessed. MethodsThe calibration procedure of the combined system is presented in this paper. The system measured the Centre of Pressure (CoP) and body Center of Mass (CoM) displacements, kicking duration and the acceleration of the kicking leg. ResultsThe margin of error found for kinematic and kinetic calibration was less than 1%. Furthermore, the expert players presented decreased CoP and CoM displacements and kicking duration and acceleration of the kicking leg compared to the novices. ConclusionThe combined system provides an effective method for the simultaneous measurement of kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with kicking and may contribute to the development of intervention studies for the improvement of balance and kicking performance in sports.","The paper discusses the development of a cost-effective biomechanical system for measuring kinematic and kinetic parameters during a lower limb pointing task in soccer players. It highlights the system's capability to assess differences between novice and expert players, indicating that experts show improved balance and kicking performance through reduced displacements and kicking duration."
Central Tendon Injury Impairs Regional Neuromuscular Activation of the Rectus Femoris Muscle,2021-10-27,,,,"We aimed to uncover which rectus femoris strain injury types affect regional activation within the rectus femoris. The rectus femoris has a region-specific functional role; the proximal region of the rectus femoris contributes more than the middle and distal regions during hip flexion. Although a history of strain injury modifies the region-specific functional role within the rectus femoris, it was not obvious which rectus femoris strain injury types affect regional activation within it. We studied 12 soccer players with a history of rectus femoris strain injury. Injury data were obtained from a questionnaire survey and magnetic resonance imaging. To confirm the region-specific functional role of the rectus femoris, surface multichannel electromyographic signals were recorded. Accordingly, eight legs had a history of central tendon injury, four had a history of myofascial junction injury, and four had a healed strain injury. When the injury was limited to the central tendon, the region-specific functional role disappeared. The region-specific functional role was confirmed when the injury was outside the central part. The neuromuscular function was also inhibited when the longitudinal range of the injured region was long. Our findings suggest that a central tendon injury with a long injury length impairs regional neuromuscular activation of the rectus femoris muscle.","This paper investigates how different types of rectus femoris strain injuries affect regional neuromuscular activation in soccer players. It finds that a central tendon injury disrupts the muscle's region-specific functional role, particularly when the injury length is extensive, while other types of injuries do not have the same effect."
Epidemiology of injuries in male and female youth football players: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-10-25,,,,"To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological data of injuries in male and female youth football players.Searches were performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus databases. Studies were considered if they reported injury incidence rate in male and female youth (≤19 years old) football players. Two reviewers (FJRP and ALV) extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach determined the quality of evidence. Studies were combined using a Poisson random effects regression model.Forty-three studies were included. The overall incidence rate was 5.70 injuries/1000 h in males and 6.77 injuries/1000 h in females. Match injury incidence (14.43 injuries/1000 h in males and 14.97 injuries/1000 h in females) was significantly higher than training injury incidence (2.77 injuries/1000 h in males and 2.62 injuries/1000 h in females). The lower extremity had the highest incidence rate in both sexes. The most common type of injury was muscle/tendon for males and joint/ligament for females. Minimal injuries were the most common in both sexes. The incidence rate of injuries increased with advances in chronological age in males. Elite male players presented higher match injury incidence than sub-elite players. In females, there was a paucity of data for comparison across age groups and levels of play.The high injury incidence rates and sex differences identified for the most common location and type of injury reinforce the need for implementing different targeted injury-risk mitigation strategies in male and female youth football players.","This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess injury incidence rates among male and female youth football players, revealing an overall incidence of 5.70 injuries per 1000 hours in males and 6.77 in females. The findings highlight significant differences in match versus training injury rates, predominant injury types, and the need for tailored injury-risk mitigation strategies based on sex and age."
Circulating Levels of Bone Markers after Short-Term Intense Training with Increased Dairy Consumption in Adolescent Female Athletes,2021-10-25,,,,"Thirteen female adolescent soccer players (14.3 ± 1.3 years) participated in a cross-over, double-blind trial examining the effects of Greek yogurt (GY) consumption on bone biomarkers during 5 days of intense soccer training. The study took place over two intervention weeks, which consisted of a pre-training assessment day, 5 training days, and a post-training assessment day. Participants completed the GY condition and a carbohydrate isocaloric placebo control pudding condition (CHO) in random order, 4 weeks apart.

Alterations to the gut microbiome after sport-related concussion in a collegiate football players cohort,2021-10-22,,,,"Abstract Concussions, both single and repetitive, during contact sports cause brain and body alterations in athletes. The role of the brain-gut connection and changes in the microbiota have not been well established after a head injury or concussion-related health consequences. We recruited 33 Division I Collegiate football players and collected blood, stool, and saliva samples throughout the athletic season. Analysis of the gut microbiome reveals a decrease in abundance for two bacterial species, Eubacterium rectale , and Anaerostipes hadrus , after a diagnosed concussion. No significant differences were found regarding the salivary microbiome. Serum biomarker analysis shows an increase in GFAP blood levels in athletes during athletic activity. Additionally, S100β and SAA blood levels were positively correlated with the abundance of Eubacterium rectale species among athletes exposed to subconcussive impacts. These novel findings provide evidence that detecting changes in the gut microbiome may pave the way for improved concussion diagnosis following head injury.","The paper investigates the impact of sport-related concussions on the gut microbiome in collegiate football players. It finds a decrease in specific bacterial species following a concussion and identifies correlations between serum biomarkers and gut microbiome changes, suggesting that monitoring these microbiota alterations could enhance concussion diagnosis."
Bilateral Strength Asymmetry in Elite Youth Soccer Players: Differences between Age Categories,2021-10-20,,,,"The strength asymmetry of athletes as a negative health and performance factor is increasingly being researched in sports with a high load on the dominant limb when some specific unilateral movements, such as passing, jumping, and tackling, are required. This study aimed to determine the level of isokinetic strength bilateral asymmetry (BA) among knee extensors (KEs) and knee flexors (KFs) of elite youth soccer players. The sample (n = 87) consisted of three age categories of under 13 (U13), under 15 (U15), and under 17 (U17) years old. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to obtain the maximum peak torque of the KEs and KFs in the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs during concentric muscle contraction. The analysis revealed significantly lower values (p &lt; 0.05) of BA in KEs in U17 than in younger categories, U13 and U15, and higher values (p &lt; 0.05) of BA in KFs in the U15 category than in the U17category. The majority of the players in the U15 category (68%) reached KFs BA higher than 10% in comparison with U13 players (50%) and U17 players (28% of players) (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed a significant effect of age category on BA levels in young soccer players. High incidences of increased BA in the lower limbs occurred in the younger categories (U13, U15) and subsequently decreased in the later adolescent stages.","This study investigates bilateral strength asymmetry in elite youth soccer players across different age categories, specifically focusing on knee extensors and flexors. The findings demonstrate that age significantly impacts bilateral asymmetry levels, with younger players exhibiting higher asymmetry in knee flexors compared to older players."
Influence of the Foot and its Characteristics on the Risk of Injury Associated with Dynamic Balance in Soccer Players: An Observational Study,2021-10-20,,,,"Introduction: Dynamic balance (DB) is the basis for all sports motor activities. Variables such as the type of foot and the windlass mechanism (WM) could influence this balance and therefore the risk of injury to the lower limb. Currently no studies are reported that relate these elements to each other in soccer players. Objective: To determine the influence of some characteristics of the foot on the risk of injury associated with DB in young soccer players. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional, and correlational study. Forty players were included in the male sub 20 category. DB was evaluated by means of the Y balance test (YBT). To determine the type of the foot, the Herzco method and Jack's test were used to evaluate the WM. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the type of the foot and the Jack test with some scopes of the YBT. There was a significant relationship between the left WM vs left DB. Conclusion: Foot’s type and the WM influence the DB. The WM could be related to the DB, however, there seems to be no relationship between Hallux’s evaluation and foot type with the DB. Variables such as the quality of execution of the sporting gesture, exposure to load, among others, should be considered when studing the issue.","This paper investigates the relationship between foot characteristics and the risk of injury related to dynamic balance (DB) in young soccer players. It finds statistically significant differences in DB performance based on foot type and the windlass mechanism, suggesting that these factors influence dynamic balance, although other variables also play a role in injury risk."
Whole-Body Reactive Agility Metrics to Identify Football Players With a Core and Lower Extremity Injury Risk,2021-10-20,,,,"Clinical prediction models are useful in addressing several orthopedic conditions with various cohorts. American football provides a good population for attempting to predict injuries due to their relatively high injury rate. Physical performance can be assessed a variety of ways using an assortment of different tests to assess a diverse set of metrics, which may include reaction time, speed, acceleration, and deceleration. Asymmetry, the difference between right and left performance has been identified as a possible risk factor for injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the whole-body reactive agility metrics that would identify Division I football players who were at elevated risk for core, and lower extremity injuries (CLEI). This cohort study utilized 177 Division I football players with a total of 57 CLEI suffered who were baseline tested prior to the season. Single-task and dual-task whole-body reactive agility movements in lateral and diagonal direction reacting to virtual reality targets were analyzed separately. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses narrowed the 34 original predictor variables to five variables. Logistic regression analysis determined the three strongest predictors of CLEI for this cohort to be: lateral agility acceleration asymmetry, lateral flanker deceleration asymmetry, and diagonal agility reaction time average. Univariable analysis found odds ratios to range from 1.98 to 2.75 for these predictors of CLEI. ROC analysis had an area under the curve of 0.702 for any combination of two or more risk factors produced an odds ratio of 5.5 for risk of CLEI. These results suggest an asymmetry of 8-15% on two of the identified metrics or a slowed reaction time of ≥0.787 s places someone at increased risk of injury. Sixty-three percent (36/57) of the players who sustained an injury had ≥2 positive predictors In spite of the recognized limitation, these finding support the belief that whole-body reactive agility performance can identify Division I football players who are at elevated risk for CLEI.","This study investigates the use of whole-body reactive agility metrics to identify Division I football players at risk for core and lower extremity injuries (CLEI). It identifies three key predictors—lateral agility acceleration asymmetry, lateral flanker deceleration asymmetry, and diagonal agility reaction time average—that significantly correlate with increased injury risk, highlighting the potential for agility metrics in injury prediction."

"Functional and Anthropometrical Screening Test among High Performance Female Football Players: A Descriptive Study with Injury Incidence Analysis, the Basque Female Football Cohort (BFFC) Study",2021-10-12,,,,"The main objectives of the present study were to describe the injury incidence and to analyze the anthropometric and physical characteristics of players from three high-level women's football teams. The present study involved 54 female football players (21.9 ± 4.9 years old) from three different teams competing in the Spanish Reto Iberdrola-Segunda División PRO league. A battery of tests was carried out to determine the anthropometric and physical performance characteristics of the players along with an injury incidence record during a full competitive season. The obtained results showed that there was a high incidence of injury, as 38% of the players suffered some type of injury during the season (range 1-5; 1.75 ± 1.02 injuries per player). Injuries occurred in both matches and during training at a similar percentage (48.6 vs. 51.4%), and the majority of the registered episodes were graded as moderate or severe injury types (60%). Players suffering from an injury accumulated a total of 1587 chronological days off work due to injury during the season, with a recurrence rate of 55%. Considering the high incidence of injury, and the injury burden and the reinjure rate observed in this research, it seems necessary to apply the most efficient prevention and recovery measures possible in these female football teams. These descriptive data could serve athletic trainers and medical staff of female football teams to better understand their own screening procedure-derived data.","The paper examines injury incidence and analyzes the anthropometric and physical characteristics of high-performance female football players from three teams in Spain. Findings reveal a significant injury rate, with 38% of players affected, emphasizing the need for effective injury prevention and recovery strategies within women's football teams."
The influence of natural grass pitch hardness on soccer performance and game characteristics,2021-10-11,,,,"Introduction:
Traditional natural grass pitches are the most prevalent surface at
amateur-level soccer. Environmental considerations such as the climate,
weather, grass coverage and seasonal variations all have an impact on the
natural grass characteristics and affect performance of both player and surface. A
key natural grass pitch variable that may influence the performance
characteristics is the surface hardness. Therefore, the aim of the project was
to examine the influence of natural grass surface hardness on amateur-level
soccer performance and game characteristics via a mixed-method,
multidisciplinary approach. Methods: Four separate studies were carried
out, consisting of one performance analysis case study, two experimental
studies and one focus group. In the first study, one academy-level (amateur)
u-19 soccer player played in eleven competitive matches on soft and hard
natural grass pitches. In the second study, ten academy-level (amateur) College
soccer players completed a repeated sprint protocol of 40-m performed on two
natural grass pitches of contrasting surface hardness. In the third study,
performance, biomechanical and physiological responses were assessed during
steady state running and an 84-minute soccer simulation protocol on soft vs.
hard natural grass pitches. In studies one-to-three surface hardness was
measured using a Clegg Impact Hammer and pitches were categorised into either hard
or soft. In study four, four participants answered nine open-ended questions in
a focus group covering four main areas including the technical, tactical,
physical and psychological concepts of playing and coaching soccer on natural
grass pitches with contrasting surface hardness. Results: In study one
there were more turns on the soft vs. hard pitches (effect size; Cohen’s d)

Sprinting Biomechanics and Hamstring Injuries: Is There a Link? A Literature Review,2021-10-09,,,,"Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is a common and costly injury in many sports such as the various professional football codes. Most HSIs have been reported to occur during high intensity sprinting actions. This observation has led to the suggestion that a link between sprinting biomechanics and HSIs may exist. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the available scientific evidence underpinning the potential link between sprinting biomechanics and HSIs. A structured search of the literature was completed followed by a risk of bias assessment. A total of eighteen studies were retrieved. Sixteen studies involved retrospective and/or prospective analyses, of which only three were judged to have a low risk of bias. Two other case studies captured data before and after an acute HSI. A range of biomechanical variables have been measured, including ground reaction forces, trunk and lower-limb joint angles, hip and knee joint moments and powers, hamstring muscle–tendon unit stretch, and surface electromyographic activity from various trunk and thigh muscles. Overall, current evidence was unable to provide a clear and nonconflicting perspective on the potential link between sprinting biomechanics and HSIs. Nevertheless, some interesting findings were revealed, which hopefully will stimulate future research on this topic.","This literature review explores the relationship between sprinting biomechanics and hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) in various professional football codes. While it evaluates findings from 18 studies on biomechanical variables related to HSIs, the evidence remains inconclusive, highlighting the need for further research in this area."
The Assessment of a Novel Lower Body Resistance Garment As a Mechanism to Increase the Training Stimulus During Running: a Randomised Cross Over Study,2021-10-06,,,,"Abstract Background: This study examined the physiological and perceived impact of wearing a novel lower body resistance garment during exercise and recovery. Methods: Using a randomised cross over design, 15 recreationally-active males performed 2x10-minute steady-state runs followed by a 10-minute passive recovery with concomitant monitoring of oxygen consumption (V̇O 2 ), heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE; exercise portion only), wearing either the resistance garment (experimental) or running shorts (control). Results: During exercise, V̇O 2 and RPE were higher (4.5% and 7.7% respectively) in experimental than control (V̇O 2 : r =0.24, p &gt;0.05; RPE: r =0.32, p &gt;0.05) whilst HR was lower (-0.4%, r =-0.05, p &gt;0.05). During recovery, V̇O 2 and HR were lower (4.7% and 4.3% respectively) in experimental than control (V̇O 2 : r =‑0.32, p &gt;0.05; HR: r =-0.27, p &gt;0.05). Conclusions: Though effects were trivial to small, and not statistically significant, these findings provide proof of concept and suggest that this garment design may increase the training stimulus during running and aid post-exercise recovery.","This study investigates the effects of a novel lower body resistance garment on physiological responses during running and recovery in recreationally-active males. Although the results indicate trivial differences in oxygen consumption and perceived effort while wearing the garment compared to standard running shorts, the findings provide initial support for the garment's potential to enhance training stimulus and facilitate recovery."
Deficit in knee extension strength following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is explained by a reduced neural drive to the vasti muscles,2021-10-04,,,,"The persistence of quadriceps weakness represents a major concern following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The underlying adaptations occurring in the activity of spinal motoneurons are still unexplored. This study examined the discharge patterns of large populations of motor units (MUs) in the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis muscles following ACLR. Nine ACLR individuals and 10 controls performed unilateral trapezoidal contractions of the knee extensor muscles at 35%, 50% and 70% of the maximal voluntary isometric force (MVIF). High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was used to record the myoelectrical activity of the vasti muscles in both limbs. HDsEMG signals were decomposed with a convolutive blind source separation method and MU properties were extracted and compared between sides and groups. The ACLR group showed a lower MVIF on the reconstructed side compared to the contralateral side (28.1%; P < 0.001). This force deficit was accompanied by reduced MU discharge rates (∼21%; P < 0.05), lower absolute MU recruitment and derecruitment thresholds (∼22% and ∼22.5%, respectively; P < 0.05) and lower input-output gain of motoneurons (27.3%; P = 0.009). Deficits in MU discharge rates of the VL and in absolute recruitment and derecruitment thresholds of both vasti MUs were associated with deficits in MVIF (P < 0.05). A strong between-side correlation was found for MU discharge rates of the VL of ACLR individuals (P < 0.01). There were no significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). These results indicate that mid- to long-term strength deficits following ACLR may be attributable to a reduced neural drive to vasti muscles, with potential changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. KEY POINTS: Impaired expression and control of knee extension forces is common after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and is related to high risk of a second injury. To provide novel insights into the neural basis of this impairment, the discharge patterns of motor units in the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis were investigated during voluntary force contractions. There was lower knee extensor strength on the reconstructed side with respect to the contralateral side, which was explained by deficits in motor unit discharge rate and an altered motoneuronal input-output gain. Insufficient excitatory inputs to motoneurons and increased inhibitory afferent signals potentially contributed to these alterations. These results further our understanding of the neural underpinnings of quadriceps weakness following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and can help to develop effective rehabilitation protocols to regain muscle strength and reduce the risk of a second injury.","This paper investigates the underlying neural mechanisms contributing to quadriceps strength deficits following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Findings reveal that reduced motor unit discharge rates and altered motoneuronal input-output gain may explain diminished knee extension strength on the reconstructed side, underscoring the need for targeted rehabilitation strategies to address these neural impairments."
IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF SEMI-CUSTOM INSOLES AND STRUCTURED KNEE SLEEVES ON LOWER EXTREMITY KINETICS AND KINEMATICS IN RECREATIONAL MALE ATHLETES WITH PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN,2021-10-01,,,,"The aim of this experiment was to provide insight into the immediate influence of both semi-custom insoles and knee sleeves in recreational male runners/athletes suffering from patellofemoral pain and also to explore the association between the extent of patellofemoral pain and psychological wellbeing. Experiment 1 examined 17 male recreational runners with patellofemoral pain, in semi-custom insole and no-insole conditions. Experiment 2 examined 13 male recreational athletes with patellofemoral pain, undertaking run, [Formula: see text] cut and single-leg hop movements in knee sleeve and no-sleeve conditions. In both experiments, motion capture and ground reaction forces were collected, allowing kinetics and three-dimensional kinematics to be calculated alongside patellofemoral joint loading quantified using musculoskeletal modeling. In both experiments, patellofemoral pain symptoms were examined using the KOOS patellofemoral pain subscale and psychological wellbeing using the COOP-WONCA questionnaire. The findings from both experiments showed that pain symptoms significantly predicted psychological wellbeing ([Formula: see text] in experiment 1 and [Formula: see text] in experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that orthoses significantly reduced tibial internal rotation range of motion (no-[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) whilst also increasing the peak knee adduction moment (no-[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]N[Formula: see text]m/kg and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]N[Formula: see text]m/kg). The findings from experiment 2 revealed that the knee sleeve reduced the peak patellofemoral force (no-[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]BW and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]BW) in the run movement and the patellofemoral load rate in the cut movement (no-[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]BW/s and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]BW/s). Overall, the findings confirm that pain symptoms are predictive of psychological wellbeing in recreational male athletes with patellofemoral pain. Furthermore, the findings suggest that both insoles and knee sleeves may provide immediate biomechanical benefits in recreationally active individuals with patellofemoral pain, although when wearing insoles this may be at the expense of an increased knee adduction moment during running.","The paper investigates the immediate effects of semi-custom insoles and knee sleeves on lower extremity kinetics and kinematics in recreational male athletes with patellofemoral pain. Findings indicate that while insoles can reduce tibial internal rotation, they may increase knee adduction moments, and knee sleeves effectively decrease patellofemoral force and load rate during specific movements, underscoring the influence of pain on psychological wellbeing."
The use of kinesioplasty methods to optimize the motor activity of young players,2021-09-30,,,,"The article presents a theoretical analysis and summarizes approaches to the use of kinesioplasty in the training of young football players to optimize motor activity and functional reserves of individual movements.&#x0D; The analysis of the literature showed that the anatomical-physiological and psychological features of the development of the body of young football players are most favorable for the development of most physical qualities of man.&#x0D; Based on the generalization of educational and methodological and scientific literature, it was found that the mechanisms of interaction of posture and arbitrary precise movements are closely interrelated and depend on the state of postural balance and the general center of gravity of the athlete's biomechanics.&#x0D; The expediency of expanding the range of means of the training process of young football players aimed at optimizing their motor activity has been studied.&#x0D; In the sports and training process of young football players found that it is extremely important to develop both cortical mechanisms of motor coordination and the manifestation of various forms of motor coordination in the distal parts of the body, and through muscular activity - changes in spatial, force, temporal characteristics of voluntary movement, biodynamic characteristics of the athlete's posture.&#x0D; It is proved that in order to obtain a positive effect of kinesioplasty methods on the optimization of coordination abilities of young players, it is necessary to restructure the pathological motor stereotype formed as a result of spontaneous development, which adapts the athlete to increase stress and energy expenditure during sports training.

The Relationship between Preseason Common Screening Tests to Identify Inter-Limb Asymmetries in High-Level Senior and Professional Soccer Players,2021-09-28,,,,"This study sought to examine inter-limb asymmetries in common screening tests performed during preseason and to analyze the relationship between the performance in the different tests. Nineteen high-level senior and professional soccer players (age: 23.2 ± 3.1 years; height: 181 ± 0.06 cm; body mass: 75.2 ± 4.8 kg) performed several common screening tests during preseason: Dorsiflexion lunge test (DLT); bent knee fall out test (BKFO); y-balance anterior test (YBT A); y-balance posterolateral test (YBT PL); Y-balance posteromedial test (YBT PM); Heel-rise test (HRT) and single leg hamstring bridge test (SLHBT). High levels of reliability (ICC &gt; 0.88 and &lt;0.94) were observed in all the studied variables. Inter-limb significant differences were observed in DLT and YBT PM test (p &lt; 0.01) but YBT A, HRT and SLHBT presented trivial effect size (ES) (0.03; 0.07 and 0.13, respectively), contrary to DLT, BKFO and YBT PL, all with small ES (0.20; −0.23 and −0.22) and YBT PM, which revealed very large ES (2.91). Considering all data, high-level senior and professional soccer players present fairly good mean values of lower limb symmetry. Performance considering all tests was different, a fact associated with different biomechanical dynamics (e.g., YBT), nonetheless, the correlations between tests underline the relationship between these, which could represent important evidence to consider for injury prevention and performance enhancement programs.","This study investigates inter-limb asymmetries in common preseason screening tests among high-level senior and professional soccer players. The findings reveal reliable performance across various tests, highlighting significant differences in certain assessments that may be essential for injury prevention and performance enhancement strategies."
Sharing lessons learnt: Reflections on a novel approach to developing the contextual activity template,2021-09-27,,,,"Abstract Introduction There have been few published applications of the second phase of Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), Control Task Analysis, particularly the Contextual Activity Template (CAT). The current study aimed to share lessons learnt from utilizing an online survey as a novel approach to development of a CAT. The application domain was sport, specifically football goalkeeping. A secondary aim was to apply the CAT to the goalkeeping role and gain the perceptions of both goalkeeping coaches and players on the functions and situations specific to a goalkeeper during match‐play. Methods Ten SMEs with high‐level expertize in goalkeeping coaching and/or playing participated in an online survey including a series of demographic, Likert scale and open‐ended questions regarding goalkeeper specific functions and match‐play situations. Eight goalkeeper match‐play situations and 18 specific functions were included. Results A CAT model was created demonstrating the match‐play situations where specific goalkeeper functions occur. Three function groupings were identified: broad (six or more functions), moderate (between three and five functions), and specific (below three functions). Discussion Utilizing online surveys to develop a CAT model is a novel approach within the Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) literature. Further, the CAT represents a first of its kind analysis in the football performance literature. Strengths and limitations of using online surveys for the development of a CAT are discussed. In conclusion, the work suggests flexible approaches can be used to develop HFE models.","The paper discusses the application of Cognitive Work Analysis, specifically the Contextual Activity Template (CAT), in the domain of football goalkeeping.

FROM GARRINCHA’S LEGS TO NEYMAR’S LEGS: THE GENU VARUM AND VALGUM IN SOCCER. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND UPDATE,2021-09-27,,,,"ABSTRACT The presence of abnormalities in knee alignment (genu varum and genu valgum) is extremely common in soccer. It can occur in the junior league / youth academy and perpetuate itself throughout the professional career. The consequences of years of high-level sports practice in players with genu varum / genu valgum can be harmful to the knees. By observing football matches of the present and the past, the authors of the article noted that great Brazilian soccer players were, or are, affected by the malalignment of the knees: Garrincha (the most famous), Leandro, Dunga, Romário, Rivaldo and Neymar. This study aims to discuss the relationship between high-performance sport and the development of these orthopedic deformities, serving as a tool for updating the trauma-orthopedic knee subspecialty. Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.","The paper examines the prevalence of knee alignment abnormalities, specifically genu varum and genu valgum, among soccer players, emphasizing their occurrence from junior leagues to professional levels.

A Retrospective Study of Foot Biomechanics and Injury History in Varsity Football Athletes at the U.S. Naval Academy,2021-09-24,,,,"The six-item Foot Posture Index (FPI-6) was previously developed as an assessment tool to measure the posture of the foot across multiple segments and planes. It was derived from a criterion-based observational assessment of six components of each foot during static standing. The association between abnormal foot posture and musculoskeletal injuries remains unclear and is in of need further exploration.The purpose of this study was to assess the association between foot biomechanics and self-reported history of musculoskeletal pain or injury.Retrospective, cross-sectional study of collegiate football players at the U.S. Naval Academy.For each athlete, data were recorded on height, weight, self-reported history of pain or injury, and foot posture, which was measured using a FPI-6 with each item measuring the degree of pronation/supination. The primary outcome was each athlete's maximum deviation from neutral posture across the six-item index (FPImax). The prespecified primary analysis used generalized linear models to measure the association between FPImax and self-report history of pain or injury. Exploratory analyses measured the association using penalized regression (L1-norm) and a type of tree-based ensemble known as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).Data were collected on 101 athletes, 99 of whom had sufficient body mass index (BMI) data to be included for analysis. Among the 99 athletes, higher FPImax was associated with a prior history of musculoskeletal pain (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.35), although the sample size was too small for the association to be significant with 95% CI (P = .107). FPImax was not associated with a history of knee injury/pain (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15, P = .792), nor with a history of ankle/foot injury or pain (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21, P = .599). From the L1-penalized model, the FPI components with the strongest linear associations were the L6, R2, R1-squared, and FPImax. From the XGBoost model, the most important variables were FPItotal, BMI, R1, and R2.The U.S. Naval Academy football players whose foot postures deviated from neutral were more likely to have reported a previous history of musculoskeletal pain. However, this deviation from normal was not strongly associated with a specific history of pain or injury to the knee, ankle, or foot.The information ascertained from this study could be used to better inform clinicians about the value of the FPI in predicting or mitigating injuries for varsity football athletes.","This study investigates the relationship between foot biomechanics, as measured by the Foot Posture Index (FPI-6), and self-reported musculoskeletal pain or injury among varsity football athletes at the U.S. Naval Academy. While findings suggest a potential association between higher FPImax values and musculoskeletal pain history, the results were not statistically significant for specific injuries related to the knee, ankle, or foot, indicating a need for further research in this area."
Anomalous insertion of anterior and posterior horns of medial meniscus. Case report,2021-09-24,,,,"Anatomical variations of the attachment of medial meniscus are a common finding. However, anomalies of the posterior horn are extremely rare. Only two cases of posterior root anomaly have been described prior to the routine use of arthroscopy for evaluation and treatment of meniscal pathology. In this report, we present an anomaly of both the anterior and posterior roots of the medial meniscus that posed both a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.The patient is young male soccer player who is currently 16 years of age and began having the atraumatic onset of pain and symptoms that limited performance starting at age 14 and was referred for failure of response to nonoperative treatment. Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed the presence of an anteromedial meniscofemoral ligament whereas the posterior root showed no bony attachment. The radiographic and arthroscopic findings are described. The clinical decision was made after to proceed with observation, reassurance, and gradual return to full activity with physiotherapy guidance.The absence of injury, the mild complaints reported by the patient, his age, skeletal immaturity, and remaining growth led us to adopt a conservative approach to treating this anatomic variant and currently the patient is able to participate fully in sports without symptoms or restrictions.","The paper presents a case of a young male soccer player with an uncommon anatomical variation of both the anterior and posterior horns of the medial meniscus, which posed diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

The development of mandatory practices for the testing and maintenance of synthetic turf fields in the National Football League,2021-09-21,,,,"Abstract Synthetic turf has become an increasingly common playing surface in athletics. Synthetic turf maintenance and athlete health are related and are important considerations at all levels of play. As part of the development of testing practices for the National Football League (NFL) game‐day surfaces, a literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed between the years 1990 and 2018 was conducted. Additionally, a taskforce was convened, and expert opinion was solicited from members through systematic interviews regarding synthetic turf design and maintenance practices in the NFL. All game‐day synthetic turf manufacturers were routinely solicited for input during development and implementation of the mandatory practices. Appropriate maintenance practices can improve the consistency of a synthetic playing surface. Methods for evaluating surface hardness and other aspects of synthetic turf have been developed. The relationships between current hardness testing methods and injury outcomes have been studied but are not well established. Consensus methods for evaluating surface traction and cleat release at potentially injurious loading levels are currently unavailable and needed. Mandatory practices were developed and have been implemented by the NFL, which have resulted in more consistent playing surfaces over the course of a season. Despite the extant gaps in knowledge, a formalized set of testing practices and maintenance has proven effective for reducing surface variability across synthetic surfaces in the NFL. Characteristics such as surface hardness, traction, and shoe–surface interaction, and the effects of surface maintenance procedures should be the focus of future research.","This paper discusses the development of mandatory testing and maintenance practices for synthetic turf fields in the NFL, emphasizing the relationship between turf maintenance and athlete health. The research identifies gaps in knowledge regarding surface hardness, traction, and their impact on player injuries, while highlighting the successful implementation of consistent practices to improve playing surface quality over the season."
Ball heading and subclinical concussion in soccer as a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament injury,2021-09-19,,,,"Abstract Soccer players have a high risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, a potentially career-ending event. ACL rupture has been linked with abnormal neuromuscular control in the lower limb. Additionally, heading the ball with the unprotected head during game play is increasingly recognized as a major source of exposure to concussive and sub-concussive repetitive head impacts. This article provides a hypothesis of potential connection of ACL injury with ball heading in soccer players. The study reviews literature sources regarding the impact of neurocognitive alterations after ball headings in ACL injuries. Poor baseline neurocognitive performance or impairments in neurocognitive performance via sleep deprivation, psychological stress, or concussion can increase the risk for subsequent musculoskeletal injury.","This paper explores the relationship between ball heading in soccer and the risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, highlighting a potential connection that is influenced by abnormal neuromuscular control in the lower limb. It reviews the literature on neurocognitive alterations following ball heading as a risk factor for ACL injuries, emphasizing that compromised neurocognitive performance may elevate the likelihood of subsequent musculoskeletal injuries."
Integrating video tracking and GPS to quantify accelerations and decelerations in elite soccer,2021-09-17,,,,"The aim of this study was to analyze the degree of agreement comparing number and distance covered in different acceleration and deceleration sections registered by a video tracking system (MEDIACOACH) and a GPS device (WIMU PRO) during official competition. Data from a Spanish professional club were registered over the course of a season. First, the descriptive statistics presented more bursts of accelerations and decelerations in WIMU PRO than in MEDIACOACH, whereas the distances covered recorded by both systems were similar. Second, negative relationships were found (i.e., negative bias) comparing WIMU PRO to MEDIACOACH in the number of accelerations and decelerations between 0/1 m/s2 and ½ m/s2 (p < 0.05), and in the distances covered in accelerations and decelerations (p < 0.05) between 0/1 m/s2 and in accelerations and decelerations registered between 2/3 m/s2 and more than 3 m/s2. Moreover, the differences in means (i.e., standardized mean bias) across the two devices were trivial (> 0.19) and small (0.2-0.59) for most variables. The standardized typical errors in the estimate (TEE) were moderate (0.3-0.59) and small to moderate (0.1-0.29 to 0.3-0.59), respectively. Also, the Intra class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) for agreement and consistency between systems showed good and excellent values (> 0.90). The magnitude of change in means (%) between systems, defined as the percentage change between the numbers or values, was below 14% and 7% for number and distances covered, respectively. All scores in the smallest worthwhile change were lower than 9% and in the coefficients of variation were lower than 95% and 15%, respectively. Thus, both systems demonstrated an acceptable degree of agreement and could be useful in analyzing players' acceleration demands in professional soccer. However, caution is required when interpreting the results and a comparison with a gold standard is required in order to validate both systems.","This paper investigates the agreement between a video tracking system and a GPS device in measuring accelerations and decelerations in elite soccer players during official matches. The findings indicate that while both systems reported similar distances covered, WIMU PRO showed more bursts of accelerations and decelerations, with the need for careful interpretation and validation against a gold standard."
Is There a Sex Difference in Trunk Neuromuscular Control among Recreational Athletes during Cutting Maneuvers?,2021-09-17,,,,"Trunk motion is most likely to influence knee joint injury risk, but little is known about sex-related differences in trunk neuromuscular control during changes of direction. The purpose of the present study was to test whether differences in trunk control between males and females during changes of direction exist. Twelve female and 12 male recreational athletes (with at least 10 years of experience in team sport) performed unanticipated changes of direction with 30° and 60° cut angles, while 3D trunk and leg kinematics, ground reaction forces and trunk muscles electromyography were recorded. Trunk kinematics at the time of peak knee abduction moment and directed co-contraction ratios for trunk muscles during the pre-activation and weight acceptance phases were determined. None of the trunk kinematics and co-contraction ratio variables, nor peak knee abduction moment differed between sexes. Compared to the 30° cut, trunk lateral flexion remained unchanged and trunk external rotation was reduced (p < 0.001; η²p (partial eta squared for effect size) = 0.78), while peak knee abduction moment was increased (p < 0.001; η²p = 0.84) at 60°. The sharper cutting angle induced muscle co-contraction during the pre-activation directed less towards trunk flexors (p < 0.01; η²p = 0.27) but more towards trunk medial flexors and rotators opposite to the movement direction (p < 0.001; η²p > 0.46). However, muscle co-contraction during the weight acceptance phase remained comparable between 30° and 60°. The lack of sex-related differences in trunk control does not explain knee joint injury risk discrepancies between sexes during changes of direction. Trunk neuromuscular strategies during sharper cutting angles revealed the importance of external oblique muscles to maintain trunk lateral flexion at the expense of trunk rotation. This provides new information for trunk strength training purposes for athletes performing changes of direction.","This paper investigates sex differences in trunk neuromuscular control among recreational athletes during cutting maneuvers, specifically analyzing 3D trunk and leg kinematics, ground reaction forces, and trunk muscle electromyography. The study finds no significant differences between males and females in trunk control, suggesting that trunk neuromuscular strategies during sharper cutting angles are crucial for understanding injury risks and inform strength training practices for athletes."
Relation between low back pain and physical characteristics in high school male soccer players,2021-09-15,,,,"Studies have shown that soccer players have a high prevalence of low back pain (LBP). However, physical characteristics (sagittal spinal alignment and hip joint range of motion [ROM]) associated with LBP have not been clarified. This study seeks to clarify the relationship between physical characteristics and LBP in high school male soccer players. The participants were 90 high school male soccer players. The presence of LBP was evaluated using a questionnaire. We assigned the participants into two groups: the non-LBP group (n = 58) and the LBP group (n = 32). Passive ROM of hip and sagittal spinal alignment were measured. Thoracic kyphotic angle (TKA) was significantly higher in the LBP group than in the non-LBP group, and the ROM of hip joint extension in the nondominant leg was significantly lower in the LBP group than in the non-LBP group. On logistic regression analyses, TKA in the upright position (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.087, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.019–1.159, p < 0.01) and hip extension ROM deficits in the nondominant leg (adjusted OR: 0.888, 95% CI: 0.789–0.999, p < 0.05) were related to LBP in high school male soccer players as determined. This study suggests that hyperkyphosis in the upright position and hip extension ROM deficits in the nondominant leg were related to LBP in high school male soccer players.","This paper investigates the relationship between low back pain (LBP) and physical characteristics, specifically sagittal spinal alignment and hip joint range of motion, in high school male soccer players. The findings reveal that higher thoracic kyphotic angles and reduced hip extension ROM in the nondominant leg are significantly associated with the presence of LBP in this population."
A 2D qualitative movement assessment of a deceleration task detects football players with high knee joint loading,2021-09-04,,,,"Abstract Purpose The deceleration (pressing) is a common situational pattern leading to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in football. Although mainly assessed for performance purposes, a stronger focus on movement quality might support the screening of at-risk athletes. The aim of the present study was to describe a 2D scoring system for the assessment of the deceleration task and to associate it with the knee joint loading (knee abduction moment) evaluated through the gold standard 3D motion capture. The hypothesis was that lower 2D scores would be associated with higher knee joint loading. Methods Thirty-four competitive football (soccer) players (age 22.8 ± 4.1, 16 females) performed a series of deceleration tasks. 3D motion analysis was recorded using ten stereophotogrammetric cameras, a force platform, and three high-speed cameras. The 2D qualitative assessment was performed via a scoring system based on the video analysis of frontal and lateral planes joint kinematics for five scoring criteria. The intra- and inter-rater reliabilities were calculated for each 2D scoring criteria. The peak knee abduction moment was extracted and grouped according to the results of the 2D evaluation. Results An ICC &gt; 0.94 was found for all the 2D scoring criteria, both for intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. The players with low 2D frontal plane scores and low total scores (0–4) showed significantly higher peak knee abduction moment values ( p &lt; 0.001). A significant negative rank correlation was found between the total score and the peak knee abduction moment ( ρ = − 0.25, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The qualitative 2D scoring system described successfully discerned between athletes with high and low knee joint loading during a deceleration task. The application of this qualitative movement assessment based on a detailed and accurate scoring system is suitable to identify players and patients with high knee joint loading (high knee abduction moments) and target additional training in the scenario of the primary and secondary ACL injury risk reduction.

Comparisons of Vastus Lateralis Architecture and Biomechanical Characteristics during Drop Landing in Young Football Players,2021-08-31,,,,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the vastus lateralis (VL) architecture and exercise biomechanics indices during drop landing in young football players.METHODS: Fifteen young football players were divided into a long vastus lateralis muscle fascicle length group (LFG, n=8) and short vastus lateralis muscle fascicle length group (SFG, n=7). All of the participants performed drop landing onto the ground reaction force plate from a platform 30 cm high. The muscle activities of the VL, tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (GCM), angular velocity, and ground reaction force in the ankle, knee, and hip joints were measured during drop landing.RESULTS: The VL muscle activity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.032), ankle ground contact angle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.027), ankle maximum flexion angle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.014), knee maximum flexion angle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.007), and ground reaction force per body weight (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.032) were significantly higher in the LFG than in the SFG. Muscle activity of the TA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.017), ankle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.033), and hip (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.045) time to stability and the ground reaction force time to stability (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.043) were significantly lower in the LFG than in the SFG. Muscle activity of the GCM (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.053) and knee time to stability (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=.057) tended to be lower in the LFG than in the SFG.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed that muscle activity, angular velocity, and ground reaction force variables during drop landing are affected by the VL muscle fascicle length in young football players.",This study investigates the differences in vastus lateralis architecture and exercise biomechanics during drop landing among young football players with varying muscle fascicle lengths.

Biomechanical Response of the Lower Extremity to Running-Induced Acute Fatigue: A Systematic Review,2021-08-27,,,,"Objective: To investigate (i) typical protocols used in research on biomechanical response to running-induced fatigue, (ii) the effect of sport-induced acute fatigue on the biomechanics of running and functional tests, and (iii) the consistency of analyzed parameter trends across different protocols. Methods: Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, and IEEE databases were searched using terms identified with the Population, Interest and Context (PiCo) framework. Studies were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and appraised using the methodological index for non-randomized studies MINORS scale. Only experimental studies with at least 10 participants, which evaluated fatigue during and immediately after the fatiguing run were included. Each study was summarized to record information about the protocol and parameter trends. Summary trends were computed for each parameter based on the results found in individual studies. Results: Of the 68 included studies, most were based on in-lab (77.9%) protocols, endpoint measurements (75%), stationary measurement systems (76.5%), and treadmill environment (54.4%) for running. From the 42 parameters identified in response to acute fatigue, flight time, contact time, knee flexion angle at initial contact, trunk flexion angle, peak tibial acceleration, CoP velocity during balance test showed an increasing behavior and cadence, vertical stiffness, knee extension force during MVC, maximum vertical ground reaction forces, and CMJ height showed a decreasing trend across different fatigue protocols. Conclusion: This review presents evidence that running-induced acute fatigue influences almost all the included biomechanical parameters, with crucial influence from the exercise intensity and the testing environment. Results indicate an important gap in literature caused by the lack of field studies with continuous measurement during outdoor running activities. To address this gap, we propose recommendations for the use of wearable inertial sensors.","This systematic review investigates the biomechanical responses of the lower extremity during running-induced acute fatigue, focusing on typical research protocols and the effects of fatigue on running biomechanics and functional tests.

"Win, Draw, or Lose? Global Positioning System-Based Variables’ Effect on the Match Outcome: A Full-Season Study on an Iranian Professional Soccer Team",2021-08-24,,,,"The aim of the study was to determine the between-match and between-halves match variability of various Global Positioning System (GPS) variables and metabolic power average (MPA) in competitions, based on the match results obtained by professional soccer players over a full season. Observations on individual match performance measures were undertaken on thirteen outfield players competing in the Iranian Premier League. The measures selected for analysis included total duration, accelerations in zones (AccZ1, 2, and 3), decelerations in zones (DecZ1, 2, and 3), and MPA collected by the Wearable Inertial Measurement Unit (WIMU). The GPS manufacturer set the thresholds for the variables analyzed as follows: AccZ1 (&lt;2 m·s−2); AccZ2 (2 to 4 m·s−2); AccZ3 (&gt;4 m·s−2); DecZ1 (&lt;−2 m·s−2); DecZ2 (−2 to −4 m·s−2); DecZ3 (&gt;−4 m·s−2). The results revealed significant differences between wins and draws for the duration of the match and draws compared to wins for the first- half duration (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.36 [−0.43, 1.12]), (p ≤ 0.05; ES = −7.0 [−8.78, −4.78], respectively. There were significant differences on AccZ1 during the first-half between draws and defeats (p ≤ 0.05; ES = −0.43 [−1.32, 0.46]), for AccZ3 in the second-half between draws and defeats (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 1.37 [0.48, 2.25]). In addition, there were significant differences between wins and draws (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.22 [−0.62, 1.10]), and wins and defeats for MPA in the first- half (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.34 [−0.65, 1.22]). MPA showed further differences between draws and defeats in the second- half (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.57 [−0.22, 1.35]). Descriptive analysis revealed differences between the first and second half for wins in AccZ2 (p = 0.005), DecZ2 (p = 0.029), and MPA (p = 0.048). In addition, draws showed significant differences between the first and second half in duration, AccZ1, AccZ2, and DecZ2 (p = 0.008), (p = 0.017), (p = 0.040), and (p = 0.037) respectively. Defeats showed differences between the first and second half in AccZ1, AccZ3, and MPA (p = 0.001), (p = 0.018), and (p = 0.003) respectively. In summary, the study reveals large variations between the match duration, accelerometer variables, and MPA both within and between matches. Regardless of the match outcome, the first half seems to produce greater outputs. The results should be considered when performing a half-time re-warm-up, as this may be an additional factor influencing the drop in the intensity markers in the second half in conjunction with factors such as fatigue, pacing strategies, and other contextual variables that may influence the results.","This study investigates the variability of Global Positioning System (GPS) metrics and metabolic power among professional soccer players over a full season, examining their correlation with match outcomes—wins, draws, or defeats. The findings indicate significant differences in performance measures such as duration, accelerations, and metabolic power between different match results, highlighting variations in player output between the first and second halves, which could inform strategies for maintaining performance intensity throughout a match."

The study highlights that a deeper knee flexion angle at landing significantly reduces impact forces compared to an upright landing position.
"Comparison of Static Balance among Cricket, Badminton, Football and Track and Field Athletes",2021-08-23,,,,"BACKGROUND The balance plays an indispensable role in many sports. Static balance is crucial for a postural control and has an exceptional effect on the performance of sports players and for injury prevention. Sports like cricket, football, track and field, and badminton requires static balance for the execution of a sports-specific skill. Single leg stance test was used to assess balance on a surface during a 30 sec single-leg standing posture with eyes open and eyes closed. The main goal of this study was to determine that, in which sport the static balance was more and in which sport the static balance was inferior. The objectives were to assess the static balance in cricket, badminton, track and field, football athletes and compare the static balance in all 4 sports [cricket, badminton, track and field, football] METHODS A total of one hundred and twenty - four athletes [124], cricket {N = 31}, football {N = 31}, badminton {N = 31}, track and field {N = 31} voluntarily participated in the study. Static balance was assessed by using single leg stance test with eyes open and eyes closed. RESULTS By comparing all sports, it showed that there was a statistically significant difference between cricket, football, badminton and track and field athletes in dominant and non - dominant leg with eyes open and eyes closed. With eyes open, a static balance was demonstrated superior in track and field followed by football, cricket and least in badminton players in the dominant leg and non-dominant leg. (P &lt; 0.0001) Whereas, with eyes closed, comparing between sports individually, there showed no such significant difference between dominant and non-dominant leg. Static balance was superior in track and field followed by football, by cricket and least in badminton in dominant and non-dominant leg (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Track and field players did not differ in dominant and non-dominant legs. In contrast, badminton players displayed mediocre static balance with eyes open and football players displayed mediocre static balance with eyes closed. There was no significant difference between open and closed eyes. But the balance score showed superior balance in open eyes when compared with closed eyes.

A Motion Capturing and Energy Harvesting Hybridized Lower‐Limb System for Rehabilitation and Sports Applications,2021-08-19,,,,"Lower-limb motion monitoring is highly desired in various application scenarios ranging from rehabilitation to sports training. However, there still lacks a cost-effective, energy-saving, and computational complexity-reducing solution for this specific demand. Here, a motion capturing and energy harvesting hybridized lower-limb (MC-EH-HL) system with 3D printing is demonstrated. It enables low-frequency biomechanical energy harvesting with a sliding block-rail piezoelectric generator (S-PEG) and lower-limb motion sensing with a ratchet-based triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG). A unique S-PEG is proposed with particularly designed mechanical structures to convert lower-limb 3D motion into 1D linear sliding on the rail. On the one hand, high output power is achieved with the S-PEG working at a very low frequency, which realizes self-sustainable systems for wireless sensing under the Internet of Things framework. On the other hand, the R-TENG gives rise to digitalized triboelectric output, matching the rotation angles to the pulse numbers. Additional physical parameters can be estimated to enrich the sensory dimension. Accordingly, demonstrative rehabilitation, human-machine interfacing in virtual reality, and sports monitoring are presented. This developed hybridized system exhibits an economic and energy-efficient solution to support the need for lower-limb motion tracking in various scenarios, paving the way for self-sustainable multidimensional motion tracking systems in near future.","The paper presents a hybridized lower-limb motion capturing and energy harvesting system designed for rehabilitation and sports applications.

Rehabilitation after a Complete Avulsion of the Proximal Rectus Femoris Muscle: Considerations from a Case Report,2021-08-18,,,,"Background: A complete avulsion of the proximal rectus femoris muscle is a rare but severity injury. There is a lack of substantial information for its operative treatment and rehabilitation; in particular there is a lack of biomechanical data to evaluate long-term outcomes. Case presentation: The case report presents the injury mechanism and surgical treatment of a complete avulsion of the proximal rectus femoris muscle in a 41-year-old recreational endurance athlete. Moreover, within a one-year follow-up period, different biomechanical tests were performed to get more functional insights into changes in neuromuscular control, structural muscle characteristics, and endurance performance. Within the first month post-surgery, an almost total neuromuscular inhibition of the rectus femoris muscle was present. A stepwise reduction in inter-limb compensations was observable (e.g., in crank torque during cycling) during the rehabilitation. Muscular intra-limb compensations were shown at six months post-surgery and even one year after surgery, which were also represented in the long-term adaption of the muscle characteristics and leg volumes. A changed motor control strategy was shown by asymmetric muscle activation patterns during ergometer cycling, while the power output was almost symmetric. During rehabilitation, there might be a benefit to normalizing neuromuscular muscle activation in ergometer cycling using higher loads. Conclusions: While the endurance performance recovered after six months, asymmetries in neuromuscular control and structural muscle characteristics indicate the long-term presence of inter- and intra-limb compensation strategies.","This paper discusses the surgical treatment and rehabilitation of a complete avulsion of the proximal rectus femoris muscle in a recreational endurance athlete and the subsequent functional outcomes assessed through biomechanical testing. Key findings indicate significant neuromuscular inhibition post-surgery, the presence of inter-limb and intra-limb compensations over a year, and emphasize the importance of normalizing muscle activation during rehabilitation to improve endurance performance."

The isometric horizontal push test correlates with jumping and sprinting performance among athletes and recreationally active controls,2021-08-06,,,,"The aim of this study was two-fold: (i) to examine the relationships between force outputs measured in the isometric horizontal push test (IHPT) and athletic performances; (ii) to compare IHPT outputs between football players and recreationally active controls. Thirty-two male subjects (football players, n = 16; university students, n = 16) completed the IHPT, countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long jump (SLJ), 5 m, 10 m and 20 m sprint tests, randomly across two testing sessions. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between IHPT outputs and athletic performances by accounting for the subjects' athletic background. An independent sample t-test was used to compare the IHPT outputs between groups. Moderate to very strong linear relationships (r2 range: 0.16-0.56) were found between the IHPT and all athletic performances (all p < .026). Percent variance explained by the IHPT outputs after accounting for groups difference was 16%, 56%, 54%, 48% and 40% for CMJ height, SLJ distance, 5 m, 10 m and 20 m sprint performances, respectively. Compared to controls (6.18 ± 0.89 N/kg), football players (10.09 ± 1.57 N/kg) achieved greater IHPT force outputs (p < .001, Hedges' g = 3.2, large ES). The IHPT is clearly correlated to horizontal and vertical athletic performances and can adequately distinguish between athletes and recreationally active controls based on their IHPT results. Future studies should examine the usefulness of the IHPT as a testing tool informing training prescription and performance monitoring practices.","This study investigates the correlation between the isometric horizontal push test (IHPT) and various athletic performances such as jumping and sprinting among football players and recreationally active individuals.

Artificial Intelligence in Repairing Meniscus Injury in Football Sports with Perovskite Nanobiomaterials,2021-07-28,,,,"Knee meniscus injuries are more likely to occur in young adults in clinical practice, and their lower age of onset and greater impact on joint function after injury also put forward higher requirements for the treatment and rehabilitation of meniscus injuries. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology and arthroscopic minimally invasive technology, arthroscopic meniscus plasty and perovskite nanobiomaterial repair have gradually replaced the previous open meniscus surgery of the knee joint and has become the main method of meniscus injury treatment, and the perovskite nanobiomaterial repair technique that incorporates artificial intelligence technology is also gradually being applied. Therefore, this article studies the role of perovskite nanobiomaterials in the repair of meniscus injuries in football sports and analyzes the biological characteristics of the inner and outer meniscus to provide help to improve the healing rate of meniscus injuries. The study selected six male meniscus-injured patients (meniscus injuries caused by football sports) and obtained six injured menisci. The same cross section of the same part of the meniscus was analyzed inside and outside the meniscus. At the same time, a meniscal injury step was performed on the patient. The biological characteristics of perovskite nano-biomaterials in the repair of meniscus injuries in football sports were compared and analyzed, and the patient's gait before and after surgery was also compared. Experiments have shown that the percentage of the postoperative support phase of the affected limb is significantly higher than that before surgery (P < 0.05), the percentage of the postoperative support phase and flatfoot phase decreased compared with that before surgery, and the gait cycle parameters of both lower extremities improved after surgery, obviously (P < 0.05). It explains that the arthroscopic repair of perovskite nanobiomaterials combined with the artificial intelligence technology to repair the meniscus anterior angle injury is simple and does not require special equipment, has fewer complications, is safe and reliable, and has a high clinical healing rate and a high patient satisfaction rate after surgery. The curative effect is significant; artificial intelligence technology and the application of perovskite nanobiomaterials provide more possibilities for meniscus repair.","This paper explores the role of artificial intelligence and perovskite nanobiomaterials in the treatment of knee meniscus injuries in football players, highlighting the shift from traditional open surgery to minimally invasive arthroscopic techniques.

Substantially greater improvements were detected in the mean velocity for the squat (p &lt; 0.001; Effect Size = 0.95) and the hip thrust (p &lt; 0.001; Effect Size = 0.51) in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. In addition, after the intervention period players in the experimental group showed an increase in the jumping height in the unloaded double-leg and single-leg counter-movement jumps (p = 0.003-0.012; Effect Size = 0.42-0.46). The results of this study provide evidence that a 12-week neuromuscular warm-up program can be effective to improve different physical performance variables in youth female soccer players.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of a 12-week neuromuscular warm-up program on physical performance in youth female soccer players. The study found significant improvements in strength and jumping performance in the group following the neuromuscular routine compared to the control group, highlighting its potential benefits for enhancing physical capabilities in this demographic."
The Fifth Metatarsal Bone Fracture In Athletes ‐ Modalities of Treatment Related to Agility In Soccer Players,2021-07-28,,,,"The 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; metatarsal fracture is a common foot fracture which could exclude a player from competition for several months and significantly affect his or her career. This manuscript presents the treatment and rehabilitation of professional soccer players who had acute fractures of the 5th metatarsal bone and a cannulated screw fixation. The main purpose of the analysis was to determine the minimum time necessary for a permanent return to the sport after a 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; metatarsal fracture among professional soccer players. We followed the surgical and rehabilitation path of 21 professional soccer players from the Polish League (I&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and II&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; divisions) who suffered from the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; metatarsal bone fracture. All players underwent standard percutaneous internal fixation with the use of cannulated screws. The total inability to play lasted for 9.2 (± 1.86) weeks among players treated only surgically (n = 10), 17.5 (± 2.5) weeks in the conservative and later surgery group, excluding players with nonunion (n = 6), and 24.5 (± 10.5) weeks for nonunion and switch treatment (n = 4) players. Prompt fracture stabilization surgery is recommended for athletes, enabling the implementation of an aggressive rehabilitation protocol as soon as possible. Early limb loading after surgery (from week 2) does not delay fracture healing or hinder the bone union, thus rehabilitation plays a crucial role in shortening the time of RTP (return to play) and is obligatory for each athlete who undergoes surgical treatment.","This paper examines the treatment and rehabilitation protocols for professional soccer players with acute fractures of the 5th metatarsal bone, emphasizing the significance of prompt surgical intervention and early rehabilitation. The findings indicate that timely fracture stabilization and aggressive rehabilitation can significantly reduce the time required for athletes to return to play after surgery."
Hamstrings Tendons Thickness in ACL Reconstruction: Is it Possible to Predict it By Isometric Torque in Soccer Athletes?,2021-07-22,,,,"Objective: To acess the relationship between knee flexor and extensor torques and the thickness of the quadruple hamstrings tendons, extracted during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery, in amateur soccer athletes. Materials and Methods:This is a cross-sectional study in which 38 amateur soccer athletes of both genders, diagnosed with recent and isolated ACL ligament injury, participated.Epidemiological (gender, age, and dominant limb), anthropometric (height, weight, and BMI), and biomechanical data of the injured lower limb (isometric extensor and flexor torques of the ipsilateral knee) were evaluated.Pearson's correlation test was used to analyze the correlation of torques with the quantitative variables of the study, and the multivariate analysis was performed using the linear regression test with one-way ANOVA and the calculation of R2.The level of statistical significance was set at 5% (p< 0.05). Results:The final study sample (33 participants) had a mean age of 30 years, with 81.8% males.Significant correlations were observed between knee flexor torque and height (p=0.002),weight (p=0.01) and graft diameter (p<0.001).In multivariate analysis a statistically significant result was observed for flexor torque (p=0.007).

The study finds significant relationships between knee flexor torque and several anthropometric factors, suggesting that knee flexor torque may be a useful predictor of hamstring tendon thickness for surgical planning."
Coordination and agility: How is the correlation in improving soccer dribbling skills?,2021-07-20,,,,"Investigation that was raised in this study was to improve dribbling skills. One form of training that must be done is coordination training and agility training for the players of the Tunas Muda Medan Football School (SSB TMM). Furthermore, it is expected that discoveries can be made that can improve dribbling skills with other training components for soccer players in soccer schools. This study aims to improve the skills of dribbling SSB TMM players in the city of Medan, North Sumatra Province by using coordination training and agility training. The experimental population was all SSB TMM players with a sample of 22 people. The research method used is descriptive with a correlational process, the analysis system is used to test the hypothesis which is the normality test, linearity test, and correlation test. From the end of the first hypothesis correlation test, a significance value of 0.046 &lt;0.050 is obtained, so there is a significant relationship between coordination on the results of the ability of dribbling ball. The achievement of the second hypothesis test has a significance value of 0.037 &lt;0.05, so there is a significant relationship between agility and the results of the ability to dribble a ball. Based on the multiple regression test, it is known that the significance is 0.037 &lt;0.05, then H0 is not accepted and Ha is accepted. Thus, the two components of coordination and agility simultaneously have a significant relationship with the ability to dribble a ball.","This paper investigates the correlation between coordination and agility training in improving dribbling skills among players at the Tunas Muda Medan Football School.

Evaluating the Spectrum of Cognitive-Motor Relationships During Dual-Task Jump Landing,2021-07-16,,,,"Cognitive function plays a role in understanding noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries, but the research into how cognitive function influences sport-specific movements is underdeveloped. The purpose of this study was to determine how various cognitive tasks influenced dual-task jump-landing performance along with how individuals' baseline cognitive ability mediated these relationships. Forty female recreational soccer and basketball players completed baseline cognitive function assessments and dual-task jump landings. The baseline cognitive assessments quantified individual processing speed, multitasking, attentional control, and primary memory ability. Dual-task conditions for the jump landing included unanticipated and anticipated jump performance, with and without concurrent working memory and captured visual attention tasks. Knee kinematics and kinetics were acquired through motion capture and ground reaction force data. Jumping conditions that directed visual attention away from the landing, whether anticipated or unanticipated, were associated with decreased peak knee flexion angle (P < .001). No interactions between cognitive function measures and jump-landing conditions were observed for any of the biomechanical variables, suggesting that injury-relevant cognitive-motor relationships may be specific to secondary task demands and movement requirements. This work provides insight into group- and subject-specific effects of established anticipatory and novel working memory dual-task paradigms on the neuromuscular control of a sport-specific movement.","This paper investigates the influence of cognitive tasks on dual-task jump-landing performance in female recreational soccer and basketball players, specifically focusing on how baseline cognitive abilities affect outcomes. The findings reveal that directing visual attention away from the landing decreases peak knee flexion angle, with no significant interactions observed between cognitive function measures and biomechanical variables, indicating the specificity of injury-relevant cognitive-motor relationships to task demands."
Associations between Hamstring Fatigue and Sprint Kinematics during a Simulated Football (Soccer) Match,2021-07-15,,,,"Neuromuscular fatigue is considered to be important in the etiology of hamstring strain injuries in football. Fatigue is assumed to lead to decreases in hamstring contractile strength and changes in sprinting kinematics, which would increase hamstring strain injury risk. Therefore, the aim was to examine the effects of football-specific fatigue on hamstring maximal voluntary torque (MVT) and rate of torque development (RTD), in relation to alterations in sprinting kinematics.Ten amateur football players executed a 90-min running-based football match simulation. Before and after every 15 min of simulated play, MVT and RTD of the hamstrings were obtained in addition to the performance and lower body kinematics during a 20-m maximal sprint. Linear mixed models and repeated measurement correlations were used to assess changes over time and common within participant associations between hamstring contractile properties and peak knee extension during the final part of the swing phase, peak hip flexion, peak combined knee extension and hip flexion, and peak joint angular velocities, respectively.Hamstring MVT and sprint performance were significantly reduced by 7.5% and 14.3% at the end of the football match simulation. Unexpectedly, there were no indications for reductions in RTD when MVT decrease was considered. Decreases in hamstring MVT were significantly correlated to decreases in peak knee angle (R = 0.342) and to increases in the peak combined angle (R = -0.251).During a football match simulation, maximal voluntary isometric hamstring torque declines. This decline is related to greater peak knee extension and peak combined angle during sprint running, which indicates a reduced capacity of the hamstrings to decelerate the lower leg during sprint running with fatigue.","The paper investigates the impact of neuromuscular fatigue on hamstring strength and sprint kinematics during a simulated football match. It finds that hamstring maximal voluntary torque decreases significantly with fatigue, which correlates with alterations in sprinting kinematics related to knee and hip angles, suggesting an increased risk of hamstring strain injuries during fatigue."
Head Impact Biomechanics in Youth Flag Football: A Prospective Cohort Study,2021-07-15,,,,"Background: Youth flag football participation has rapidly grown and is a potentially safer alternative to tackle football. However, limited research has quantitatively assessed youth flag football head impact biomechanics. Purpose: To describe head impact biomechanics outcomes in youth flag football and explore factors associated with head impact magnitudes. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We monitored 52 player-seasons among 48 male flag football players (mean ± SD; age, 9.4 ± 1.1 years; height, 138.6 ± 9.5 cm; mass, 34.7 ± 9.2 kg) across 3 seasons using head impact sensors during practices and games. Sensors recorded head impact frequencies, peak linear ( g) and rotational (rad/s 2 ) acceleration, and estimated impact location. Impact rates (IRs) were calculated as 1 impact per 10 player-exposures; IR ratios (IRRs) were used to compare season, event type, and age group IRs; and 95% CIs were calculated for IRs and IRRs. Weekly and seasonal cumulative head impact frequencies and magnitudes were calculated. Mixed-model regression models examined the association between player characteristics, event type, and seasons and peak linear and rotational accelerations. Results: A total of 429 head impacts from 604 exposures occurred across the study period (IR, 7.10; 95% CI, 4.81-10.50). Weekly and seasonal cumulative median head impact frequencies were 1.00 (range, 0-2.63) and 7.50 (range, 0-21.00), respectively. The most frequent estimated head impact locations were the skull base (n = 96; 22.4%), top of the head (n = 74; 17.2%), and back of the head (n = 66; 15.4%). The combined event type IRs differed among the 3 seasons (IRR range, 1.45-2.68). Games produced greater IRs (IRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53) and peak linear acceleration (mean difference, 5.69 g; P = .008) than did practices. Older players demonstrated greater combined event–type IRs (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.90) and increased head impact magnitudes than did younger players, with every 1-year age increase associated with a 3.78 g and 602.81-rad/s 2 increase in peak linear and rotational acceleration magnitude, respectively ( P≤ .005). Conclusion: Head IRs and magnitudes varied across seasons, thus highlighting multiple season and cohort data are valuable when providing estimates. Head IRs were relatively low across seasons, while linear and rotational acceleration magnitudes were relatively high.","This paper investigates head impact biomechanics in youth flag football, analyzing data from 52 player-seasons to quantify head impacts during games and practices. The study reveals that head impact rates and magnitudes vary by season and player age, with older players experiencing higher impact accelerations compared to younger ones."
Effect of Muscle Energy Technique on Kicking Speed in Football Players with Hamstring Tightness - An Experimental Study,2021-07-12,,,,"Background: Football is a dynamic sport that requires athlete to perform many different movements and skills such as rapid acceleration and deceleration, jumping, kicking, and sliding, quick changes of directions. Hamstring muscle injury being the commonest injury is due to hamstring tightness. Prevalence of hamstring injury is common in football players because of its tightness. Muscle energy technique helps in increasing Hamstring flexibility of football players with hamstring tightness. Purpose of Study: The purpose of this study was to find out the effect of Muscle energy technique on kicking speed in football players with hamstring tightness. The players were given 6 days Muscle energy technique on hamstring muscle to improve its flexibility. Kicking speed time was checked pre and post Muscle energy technique. Materials and Methodology: Football players with hamstring tightness [n=40] were included in this study. Muscle energy technique was given for hamstring tightness for 6 days. Pre and post kicking speed time of the players were noted. Result: There was decrease in kicking speed time of the players when compared with pre [0.785] and post [0.4450] Muscle energy technique was proved statistically significant [p=0.000]. Conclusion: It is concluded that Muscle energy technique helps in decreasing the kicking speed time i.e. the ball will cover the given distance in shorter period of time in football players with hamstring tightness and hence helps in bringing out their best performance on field. Key words: Muscle energy technique [MET], Hamstring tightness, kicking speed time.","The paper investigates the impact of Muscle Energy Technique (MET) on the kicking speed of football players suffering from hamstring tightness. It concludes that implementing MET significantly improves kicking speed, allowing players to perform better on the field by reducing the time it takes for the ball to cover a given distance."

Injury risk among athletes on artificial turf: a review of current literature,2021-07-08,,,,"Artificial turf is used commonly as an alternative to natural grass for athletic playing surfaces, primarily for its ease of maintenance, multi-use capability year-round, and cost. Prior studies have demonstrated increased biomechanical stresses at the shoe-surface interface on artificial turf when compared to natural grass. However, there is debate whether the altered shoe-surface interface confers additional risk for injury to athletes. The purpose of this study was to review the current literature on injury risk associated with artificial turf among various sports played on turf. The present study was a clinical review of the current literature regarding injury risk on artificial and natural turf. While playing surface generally does not appear to impact overall injury risk in soccer and rugby players, data is inconclusive among American football athletes. Lower-extremity injuries, in particular knee and ankle injuries, more commonly occur on artificial turf in comparison to natural grass. Surface and sport-specific shoes, third-generation artificial turf, and routine monitoring and maintenance have all been shown to reduce the risk of injury on artificial turf. When athletes must play on artificial turf, surface-specific strategies may be implemented to reduce their risk of injury. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate further these risk reduction strategies. Level of Evidence: Level V.","This paper reviews existing literature on injury risks associated with artificial turf surfaces compared to natural grass in various sports. It highlights that while overall injury risk may not significantly differ for soccer and rugby players, lower-extremity injuries are more prevalent on artificial surfaces, particularly in American football, and suggests strategies for mitigating these risks through shoe selection and surface maintenance."
Automated Classification of Changes of Direction in Soccer Using Inertial Measurement Units,2021-07-06,,,,"Changes of direction (COD) are an important aspect of soccer match play. Understanding the physiological and biomechanical demands on players in games allows sports scientists to effectively train and rehabilitate soccer players. COD are conventionally recorded using manually annotated time-motion video analysis which is highly time consuming, so more time-efficient approaches are required. The aim was to develop an automated classification model based on multi-sensor player tracking device data to detect COD > 45°. Video analysis data and individual multi-sensor player tracking data (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscopic) for 23 academy-level soccer players were used. A novel 'GPS-COD Angle' variable was developed and used in model training; along with 24 GPS-derived, gyroscope and accelerometer variables. Video annotation was the ground truth indicator of occurrence of COD > 45°. The random forest classifier using the full set of features demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUROC = 0.957, 95% CI = 0.956-0.958, Sensitivity = 0.941, Specificity = 0.772. To balance sensitivity and specificity, model parameters were optimised resulting in a value of 0.889 for both metrics. Similarly high levels of accuracy were observed for random forest models trained using a reduced set of features, accelerometer-derived variables only, and gyroscope-derived variables only. These results point to the potential effectiveness of the novel methodology implemented in automatically identifying COD in soccer players.","The paper focuses on the development of an automated classification model to detect changes of direction (COD) in soccer players using data from inertial measurement units. Key findings highlight the model's high accuracy in identifying COD > 45°, which improves efficiency in analyzing player movements compared to traditional video manual methods."
"Using Dynamics of Eye Movements, Speech Articulation and Brain Activity to Predict and Track mTBI Screening Outcomes",2021-07-06,,,,"Repeated subconcussive blows to the head during sports or other contact activities may have a cumulative and long lasting effect on cognitive functioning. Unobtrusive measurement and tracking of cognitive functioning is needed to enable preventative interventions for people at elevated risk of concussive injury. The focus of the present study is to investigate the potential for using passive measurements of fine motor movements (smooth pursuit eye tracking and read speech) and resting state brain activity (measured using fMRI) to complement existing diagnostic tools, such as the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), that are used for this purpose. Thirty-one high school American football and soccer athletes were tracked through the course of a sports season. Hypotheses were that (1) measures of complexity of fine motor coordination and of resting state brain activity are predictive of cognitive functioning measured by the ImPACT test, and (2) within-subject changes in these measures over the course of a sports season are predictive of changes in ImPACT scores. The first principal component of the six ImPACT composite scores was used as a latent factor that represents cognitive functioning. This latent factor was positively correlated with four of the ImPACT composites: verbal memory, visual memory, visual motor speed and reaction speed. Strong correlations, ranging between r = 0.26 and r = 0.49, were found between this latent factor and complexity features derived from each sensor modality. Based on a regression model, the complexity features were combined across sensor modalities and used to predict the latent factor on out-of-sample subjects. The predictions correlated with the true latent factor with r = 0.71. Within-subject changes over time were predicted with r = 0.34. These results indicate the potential to predict cognitive performance from passive monitoring of fine motor movements and brain activity, offering initial support for future application in detection of performance deficits associated with subconcussive events.","This paper investigates the use of passive measurements of fine motor movements and resting state brain activity to predict cognitive functioning outcomes in high school athletes exposed to subconcussive head impacts. The study finds that the complexity of these measurements correlates positively with cognitive performance as assessed by the ImPACT test, suggesting their potential utility in monitoring cognitive changes over a sports season."
Fatigue Induced by Repeated Changes of Direction in Élite Female Football (Soccer) Players: Impact on Lower Limb Biomechanics and Implications for ACL Injury Prevention,2021-07-05,,,,"The etiology of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury in women football results from the interaction of several extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors. Extrinsic factors change dynamically, also due to fatigue. However, existing biomechanical findings concerning the impact of fatigue on the risk of ACL injuries remains inconsistent. We hypothesized that fatigue induced by acute workload in short and intense game periods, might in either of two ways: by pushing lower limbs mechanics toward a pattern close to injury mechanism, or alternatively by inducing opposed protective compensatory adjustments.In this study, we aimed at assessing the extent to which fatigue impact on joints kinematics and kinetics while performing repeated changes of direction (CoDs) in the light of the ACL risk factors.This was an observational, cross-sectional associative study. Twenty female players (age: 20-31 years, 1st-2nd Italian division) performed a continuous shuttle run test (5-m) involving repeated 180°-CoDs until exhaustion. During the whole test, 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces were used to compute lower limb joints angles and internal moments. Measures of exercise internal load were: peak post-exercise blood lactate concentration, heart rate (HR) and perceived exertion. Continuous linear correlations between kinematics/kinetics waveforms (during the ground contact phase of the pivoting limb) and the number of consecutive CoD were computed during the exercise using a Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) approach.The test lasted 153 ± 72 s, with a rate of 14 ± 2 CoDs/min. Participants reached 95% of maximum HR and a peak lactate concentration of 11.2 ± 2.8 mmol/L. Exercise duration was inversely related to lactate concentration (r = -0.517, p < 0.01), while neither%HR max nor [La-] b nor RPE were correlated with test duration before exhaustion (p > 0.05). Alterations in lower limb kinematics were found in 100%, and in lower limb kinetics in 85% of the players. The most common kinematic pattern was a concurrent progressive reduction in hip and knee flexion angle at initial contact (10 players); 5 of them also showed a significantly more adducted hip. Knee extension moment decreased in 8, knee valgus moment increased in 5 players. A subset of participants showed a drift of pivoting limb kinematics that matches the known ACL injury mechanism; other players displayed less definite or even opposed behaviors.Players exhibited different strategies to cope with repeated CoDs, ranging from protective to potentially dangerous behaviors. While the latter was not a univocal effect, it reinforces the importance of individual biomechanical assessment when coping with fatigue.","This study investigates the effects of fatigue from repeated changes of direction (CoDs) on lower limb biomechanics in elite female football players and its implications for ACL injury risk. Findings indicate that fatigue led to altered kinematics and kinetics in the majority of participants, with some displaying potentially injury-prone behaviors, highlighting the importance of individualized biomechanical assessments in injury prevention."
Epidemiology of Injuries in National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Soccer: 2014–2015 Through 2018–2019,2021-07-01,,,,"The National Collegiate Athletic Association held the first women's soccer championship in 1982; sponsorship and participation have greatly increased since.Routine examinations of athlete injuries are important for identifying emerging temporal patterns.Exposure and injury data collected in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program during the 2014-2015 through 2018-2019 seasons were analyzed. Injury counts, rates, and proportions were used to describe injury characteristics, and injury rate ratios were used to examine differential injury rates.The overall injury rate was 8.33 per 1000 athlete-exposures. Lateral ligament complex tears (ankle sprains) (8.6%), concussions (8.3%), and quadriceps tears (5.0%) were the most commonly reported injuries. Rates of lateral ligament complex tears followed an increasing trajectory during the study period, whereas quadriceps tear rates fluctuated during the early years, and concussion rates decreased then increased.The findings of this study were mostly consistent with existing evidence; notable temporal patterns were observed with regard to lateral ligament complex tears and concussions.","This paper analyzes injury data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program for women's soccer from 2014-2019 to identify trends and characteristics of athlete injuries. Key findings include an overall injury rate of 8.33 per 1000 athlete-exposures, with lateral ligament complex tears, concussions, and quadriceps tears being the most prevalent injuries, alongside notable temporal patterns in injury rates over the study period."
NEURAL ACTIVITY PROFILES ASSOCIATED WITH ACL INJURY-RISK MECHANICS IN ECOLOGICAL SPORT SPECIFIC VIRTUAL REALITY,2021-07-01,,,,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is secondary to a multifactorial etiology encompassing anatomical, biological, mechanical, and neurological factors. The nature of the injury being primarily due to non-contact mechanics further implicates neural control as a key injury-risk factor, though it has received considerably less study. Purpose: To determine the contribution of neural activity to injury-risk mechanics in ecological sport-specific VR landing scenarios. Methods: Ten female high-school soccer players (15.5±0.85 years; 165.0±6.09 cm; 59.1±11.84 kg) completed a neuroimaging session to capture neural activity during a bilateral leg press and a 3D biomechanics session performing a header within a VR soccer scenario. The bilateral leg press involved four 30 s blocks of repeated bilateral leg presses paced to a metronome beat of 1.2 Hz with 30 s rest between blocks. The VR soccer scenario simulated a corner-kick, requiring the participant to jump and head a virtual soccer ball into a virtual goal (Figure 1A-E). Initial contact and peak knee flexion and abduction angles were extracted during the landing from the header as injury-risk variables of interest and were correlated with neural activity. Results: Evidenced in Table 1 and Figure 1 (bottom row), increased initial contact abduction, increased peak abduction, and decreased peak flexion were associated with increased sensory, visual-spatial, and cerebellar activity (r 2 = 0.42-0.57, p corrected &lt; .05, z max &gt; 3.1, table &amp; figure 1). Decreased initial contact flexion was associated with increased frontal cortex activity (r 2 = 0.68, p corrected &lt; .05, z max &gt; 3.1). Conclusion: Reduced neural efficiency (increased activation) of key regions that integrate proprioceptive, visual-spatial, and neurocognitive activity for motor control may influence injury-risk mechanics in sport. The regions found to increase in activity in relation to higher injury-risk mechanics are typically activated to assist with spatial navigation, environmental interaction, and precise motor control. The requirement for athletes to increase their activity for more basic knee motor control may result in fewer neural resources available to maintain knee joint alignment, allocate environmental attention, and handle increased motor coordination demands. These data indicate that strategies to enhance efficiency of visual-spatial and cognitive-motor control during high demand sporting activities is warranted to improve ACL injury-risk reduction. [Figure: see text][Table: see text]","This paper investigates the role of neural activity in ACL injury-risk mechanics during sport-specific virtual reality scenarios, focusing on the relationship between neural engagement and landing biomechanics. The findings suggest that reduced neural efficiency in areas responsible for proprioceptive and motor control may increase ACL injury risk, highlighting the need for strategies to enhance cognitive-motor control in high-demand sporting contexts."

Outcome of the surgery is multifactorial including graft material Selection, method of fixation etc. Our prospective study evaluates results of PCL reconstruction using quadripuled semitendinoses gracilis autograft, with 3 years follow up. Patients and Methods: 40 patients were included in the study which extended for 36 months. This was a prospective study and all cases which had PCL rupture during this period were considered for this study. Patients with isolated chronic PCL rupture as well as multi ligament injuries including PCL rupture were included in the study. Results: Physiotherapy was started on the second postoperative day and 40% had excellent outcome with Lysholm knee score whereas 60% had good outcome.

Actual and perceived motor competence mediate the relationship between physical fitness and technical skill performance in young soccer players,2021-06-30,,,,"This study examined the role of fundamental movement skills (FMS) and perceived competence in the relationship between physical fitness and technical soccer skills in children. Seventy boys aged 7-12 years of age (Mean ± SD = 9 ± 2 years) who were regularly engaged in grassroots soccer participated in the present study. The Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (Ulrich, 2001. Test of gross motor development (2nd ed.). Austin, TX: PRO-ED) was used to assess FMS and the Perceived Physical Ability Scale for Children (Colella, Morano, Bortoli, & Robazza, 2008. A physical self-efficacy scale for children. Social Behavior and Personality: an International Journal, 36, 841-848) was used to assess perceived competence. Technical skill was determined from three tests reflecting dribbling, passing and shooting. Z-scores of each measure were summed, creating a composite measure of technical skill. Three measures of physical fitness were employed; 15m sprint time, standing long jump, and seated medicine ball (1kg) throw. Z-scores for each measure were summed creating a composite measure of physical fitness. The relationship between technical skill and FMS, fitness, perceived competence and age was examined via path analysis. Results indicated two significant mediated pathways: from physical fitness to technical skills via FMS, and from physical fitness to technical skills via perceived competence. Once these mediators had been accounted for, there was no direct link from physical fitness to technical skills. Coaches should therefore seek to avoid one-sided delivery of practice by not solely focusing on football type drills, and focusing on a range of activities which enhance a broad foundation of FMS and promote strategies to positively influence a child's perception of their own competence.HighlightsFundamental movement skills (FMS) are considered the foundation for physical activity and sport performance yet they tend to be overlooked, in favour of physical fitness, in the development of soccer talent.We examined mediating effects of FMS and perceived competence in the relationship between physical fitness and technical soccer skills in 70, 7-12 year old grassroots soccer players.We suggests there is no direct effect of physical fitness on technical skills in soccer but both FMS and perceived competence act as mediators of the physical fitness-technical skill relationship in children aged 7-12 years old.Coaches should therefore look to develop a broad base of FMS and a higher perception of competence to improve children's technical soccer skills.","This paper investigates the relationship between physical fitness, fundamental movement skills (FMS), and perceived competence as they relate to technical skill performance in young soccer players aged 7-12.

Poor Motor Coordination Elicits Altered Lower Limb Biomechanics in Young Football (Soccer) Players: Implications for Injury Prevention through Wearable Sensors,2021-06-25,,,,"Motor coordination and lower limb biomechanics are crucial aspects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention strategies in football. These two aspects have never been assessed together in real scenarios in the young population. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of motor coordination on lower limb biomechanics in young footballers during an on-the-pitch training. Eighteen juvenile football players (10 y ± 2 m) were enrolled. Each player performed a training drill with sport-specific movements (vertical jump, agility ladders, change of direction) and the Harre circuit test (HCT) to evaluate players' motor coordination. Wearable inertial sensors (MTw Awinda, Xsens) were used to assess lower limb joint angles and accelerations. Based on the results of the HCT, players were divided into poorly coordinated (PC) and well-coordinated (WC) on the basis of the literature benchmark. The PC group showed a stiffer hip biomechanics strategy (up to 40% lower flexion angle, ES = 2.0) and higher internal-external hip rotation and knee valgus (p < 0.05). Significant biomechanical limb asymmetries were found only in the PC group for the knee joint (31-39% difference between dominant and non-dominant limb, ES 1.6-2.3). Poor motor coordination elicited altered hip and knee biomechanics during sport-specific dynamic movements. The monitoring of motor coordination and on-field biomechanics might enhance the targeted trainings for ACL injury prevention.","This paper investigates the relationship between motor coordination and lower limb biomechanics in young football players, highlighting its implications for ACL injury prevention.

Local dynamic stability of the lower-limb as a means of post-hoc injury classification,2021-06-04,,,,"Since most sporting injuries occur at the lower extremity (50% to 66%) and many of those injuries occur at the knee (30% to 45%), it is important to have robust metrics to measure risk of knee injury. Dynamic measures of knee stability are not commonly used in existing metrics but could provide important context to knee health and improve injury screening effectiveness. This study used the Local Dynamic Stability (LDS) of knee kinematics during a repetitive vertical jump to perform a post-hoc previous injury classification of participants. This study analyzed the kinematics from twenty-seven female collegiate division 1 (D1) soccer, D1 basketball, and club soccer athletes from Auburn University (height = 171 ± 8.9cm, weight = 66.3 ± 8.6kg, age = 19.8 ± 1.9yr), with 7 subjects having sustained previous knee injury requiring surgery and 20 subjects with no history of injury. This study showed that LDS correctly identified 84% of previously injured and uninjured subjects using a multivariate logistic regression during a fatigue jump task. Findings showed no statistical difference in kinematic position at maximum knee flexion during all jumps between previously injured and uninjured subjects. Additionally, kinematic positioning at maximum knee flexion was not indicative of LDS values, which would indicate that future studies should look specifically at LDS with respect to injury prevention as it cannot be effectively inferred from kinematics. These points suggest that the LDS preserves information about subtle changes in movement patterns that traditional screening methods do not, and this information could allow for more effective injury screening tests in the future.","The paper explores the use of Local Dynamic Stability (LDS) of knee kinematics during vertical jumps as a metric for post-hoc injury classification, emphasizing the importance of this metric in assessing knee injury risk. The study findings indicate that LDS can effectively differentiate between previously injured and uninjured athletes, highlighting its potential for improving injury screening methods in sports."

Various methods of maturity estimation exist with limited knowledge of concordance between methods. This study aims to establish agreement between methods of varied constructs to predict maturity status and compare concordance of methods to categorise players using established thresholds. Methods This study compared four maturity equations using anthropometrical data from 113 male adolescent soccer players (mean ±SD; age, 14.3 ± 1 years) from two academies. Conservative (±1 year) and less conservative (±0.5 years) circa-PHV thresholds were employed. Results Analysis indicates tight (±0.3 year) agreement between maturity offset methods (MO), but broader agreement between MO and predicted adult height methods (–1.5 to 1 year). However, Kappa Cohen k suggests moderate to substantial (44%–67%) and fair to moderate (31%–60%) concordance between methods when using the conservative and less conservative circa-PHV thresholds respectively. Conclusion Despite MO equation iterations claiming to reduce systematic error, they provide very similar estimations. Additionally, practitioners should not use maturity offset and predicted adult height methods interchangeably and are encouraged to apply either method consistently when looking to estimate maturity status or biologically calssify players.","This paper investigates the methodologies used to estimate somatic maturity in adolescent soccer players, focusing on the concordance between various maturity estimation methods.

The Temporal Pattern of Recovery in Directional Dynamic Stability Post Football-Specific Fatigue,2021-05-28,,,,"Rising injury rates within football require further understanding of the etiological risk factors associated with lower-limb injury.To examine the temporal pattern of recovery of directional dynamic stability measures post football-specific fatigue.Eighteen male elite footballers completed baseline assessments of directional dynamic stability measures (Overall Stability Index, anterior-posterior stability [A-P], medial-lateral stability [M-L] on level 1 of the Biodex Stability System). Post Soccer-Specific Aerobic Field Test90 measures were repeated immediately, +24 hours, +48 hours, and +72 hours. The main effects for the recovery time and direction of stability were supplemented by regression modeling to describe the temporal pattern of recovery.Significant main effects for time were identified for all directions of stability (Overall Stability Index, A-P, and M-L) up to +48 hours postexercise (P ≤ .05). The quadratic pattern of temporal recovery highlights a minimum of 37.55 to 38.67 hours and maximum of 75.09 to 77.33 hours. Additionally, a main effect for direction of stability was observed, with significant differences identified between A-P and M-L stability at all time points (P ≤ .001).Reductions in directional dynamic stability +48 hours postfatigue highlight implications for training design, recovery strategies, and injury management for performance practitioners. Interestingly, A-P stability has been highlighted as being significantly reduced compared with M-L stability at all time points, regardless of the fatigue exposure.

"The epidemiology, evaluation, and assessment of lateral ankle sprains in athletes",2021-05-26,,,,"Approximately 30,000 ankle injuries occur every day in the United States. With the incidence estimated at more than 3 million a year and at a rate of 2.15/1,000 in the U.S. alone, medical specialists and other healthcare providers caring for the foot and ankle must take notice. Despite the millions of ankle injuries sustained annually, the true incidence may be underestimated, as fewer than half of individuals with ankle sprains seek medical attention from healthcare professionals. The economic burden associated with the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment is close to $4 billion annually. Ankle sprains account for half of all sports injuries and remains a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the athlete. Accurate diagnosis is critical as 40% of ankle sprains are misdiagnosed or poorly treated leading to chronic ankle pain and disability. Implementing evidence supported diagnostic and treatment strategies is the goal for ensuring safe and rapid return to play. The Lateral Ankle Sprain (LAS) is among the most common type of ankle sprains suffered during athletic activities. Up to 80% of LAS are of the inversion type, and 75% lead to recurrence and instability. Although most individuals experiencing a LAS return to activity within six weeks, many report continued pain, diminished function, and instability. The purpose of this review is to highlight the epidemiology, pathoetiology, pathoanatomy, and biomechanics of the LAS, enabling sports physicians to implement the best practice guidelines and protocols to manage this common enigma.","The paper addresses the high prevalence and economic impact of lateral ankle sprains (LAS) in athletes, highlighting that they account for half of all sports injuries. It emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment to prevent chronic pain and instability, and advocates for evidence-based strategies to improve management outcomes in those affected by LAS."
ANALYSIS ON CLASSIFICATION OF FOOTBALL TECHNIQUE,2021-05-25,,,,"Football is a situation sport where football players are characterized by a great variety and complexity of activities during the game, both in contact with the opponent and in the immediate vicinity of the opponent, while cooperating with other teammates. Sports scientists and coaches need to find out more about the set of techniques, its diversity and the amount of technique in top level football games in order to guide the optimal planning and implementation of the training process in the technical training of football players. Due to the diversity of techniques used by football players, there are different approaches to the classification of these techniques. However, it is very important to group all techniques according to their common features in order to adequately assess the structure of a football game, its development tendencies and issues. Research aim: to compare and analyse the essence of the classification of football technique and its development tendencies. Research methods: analysis of scientific articles (electronic scientific databases ScienceDirect, Google Scholar), search keywords – football, football technique, classification of football technique. Main results of the research: two main approaches dominate in the classification of football technique: the technique approach and the game approach. Initially, football technique was mainly grouped by taking into account the player’s actions with or without the ball, the level of difficulty of the technique element, the role of the players and the player’s actions on the spot or in motion. As football develops, football technique is classified by taking into account the effectiveness of its application in specific tactical situations.",This paper examines the classification of football techniques to enhance training processes for players by identifying the diversity and complexity of techniques employed during games. It highlights the two predominant classification approaches—technique and game approaches—and discusses how these classifications have evolved in relation to the tactical effectiveness of player actions.
Back Problems: Pros and Cons of Core Strengthening Exercises as a Part of Athlete Training,2021-05-18,,,,"While competitive training is usually associated with the prevalence of back pain and injuries in athletes, little attention is being paid to the positive effects of sport-specific exercises on core musculature in the prevention of back problems. This scoping review aims (i) to map the literature that addresses the effects on reduction of back problems following athlete training with differing demands on the core musculature and (ii) to identify gaps in the existing literature and propose future research on this topic. The main literature search was conducted on the MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases and was completed on Elsevier, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. A total of 21 research articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings of 17 studies identified that core strengthening and core stabilization exercises, alone or in combination with athlete training, contribute to the reduction of back pain in athletes, whereas only four studies revealed no significant association of core muscle strength and/or endurance with back problems. Nevertheless, more research is warranted to elucidate the pros and cons of purely sport-specific training with differing demands on the core musculature on back health in athletes. This could help us to design prevention strategies specifically tailored to individual athletes.","This scoping review investigates the impact of core strengthening exercises on reducing back problems in athletes and identifies existing research gaps. The review synthesizes findings from 21 articles, indicating a positive correlation between core training and back pain reduction, while suggesting the need for further studies to refine prevention strategies tailored to individual athletes."
Physical Conditioning Strategies for the Prevention of Concussion in Sport: a Scoping Review,2021-05-17,,,,"Concussion in sports has received a great deal of media attention and may result in short and longer-lasting symptoms, especially in adolescents. Although significant strides have been made in the identification and management of concussion, less is known about the primary prevention of this condition. The aims of this scoping review are to (1) summarize the current research of physical conditioning strategies to reduce or prevent concussion incidence in individuals participating in sport, especially adolescents, and (2) to identify gaps in the knowledge base. Our research question was what is known from the existing literature about physical preparation strategies to reduce or prevent concussion in adult and adolescent sports? Three literature searches were conducted by information officers at two universities at six-month intervals, using five electronic databases (PubMed; WorldCat.org ; Mendeley; EBSCOHost and Ovid MEDLINE). To increase the search range, subject experts were consulted and articles and reference lists were hand searched. A scoping review methodology identified eligible studies that analyzed physical preparation techniques on modifiable physical risk factors in athletes to reduce the incidence of concussion. The PRISMA-ScR checklist guided the reporting of the findings. A total of 1414 possible articles were identified, after duplicates removed, and articles analyzed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 9 articles qualified for analysis. Two articles were found from studying reference lists. Thus, a total of 11 articles were included in the final evaluation for the purposes of this study. Data are reported from mostly adolescent subjects participating in nine different sports from three countries. Findings are presented with specific reference to previously recognized modifiable risk factors of concussion which include neck strength, neck size, cervical stiffness, type of sport, and pre-activity exercises. There is limited research examining the physical preparation of athletes, especially in adolescents, to reduce or prevent concussion, and conflicting evidence in the few small sample studies that were identified. This scoping review identifies the research gap for a potentially vital modifiable risk factor, notably in the physical preparation of children and adolescents to reduce or prevent sports-related concussion.","This paper is a scoping review that examines the effectiveness of physical conditioning strategies in reducing or preventing concussions in adolescent athletes across various sports. The findings highlight a significant gap in research regarding modifiable risk factors, such as neck strength and pre-activity exercises, emphasizing the need for further investigation into physical preparation techniques to mitigate concussion incidence."
The Effectiveness of the Educational Field to Developing the Skills of Dribbling and Shooting of Football For Youth,2021-05-17,,,,"The importance of the research lies in preparing an educational field in developing the skills of dribblingand shooting football for cubs, depending on the stock of motor skills that were learned in a previous period,which are prerequisites for motor learning and achieving good technical performance that secures a levelof performance. As for the research problem: through the experience of field researchers, they noticed thatthere is a weakness in the performance of the dribbling and scoring skills of the young players, and that thelevel of dribbling and scoring performance is not commensurate with the level required for this stage, a thedirect interest in dribbling and scoring through skill exercises is not sufficient to reach high performancewithout concern for the effectiveness of the educational field, and this is what the cubs’ teams suffer at leastin our country, and if there is interest in these variables, then it is random and includes training that doesnot distinguish between the important and most important dimensions and components of these variables.Therefore, the researchers decided to prepare an educational field in developing the skills of dribbling andscoring football for cubs in order to reach the desired and intended achievement.","This paper focuses on developing dribbling and shooting skills in youth football through an educational framework.

Systematic Video Analysis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Professional Female Soccer Players,2021-05-14,,,,"Background: Female soccer players are particularly susceptible to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, accounting for 16% to 43% of the injury burden during the season. Despite the advancements in injury prevention programs, the rate of ACL injuries continues to rise. Purpose: To provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms, situational pattern, and biomechanics of ACL injuries in women’s soccer. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We identified 57 consecutive ACL injuries that occurred in matches of 6 top female leagues across 3 seasons (2017-2020). A total of 35 (61%) injury videos were analyzed for the mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 29 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. The distribution of ACL injuries according to month, timing within the match, and field location at the time of injury was also reported. Results: In the 35 injury videos, there were 19 (54%) noncontact injuries, 12 (34%) indirect contact injuries, and 4 (11%) direct contact injuries. We identified 3 main situations in players who suffered a noncontact/indirect contact injury: (1) pressing and tackling (n = 18), (2) regaining balance after kicking (n = 7), and (3) being tackled (n = 4). Biomechanical analysis indicated multiplanar mechanisms with frequent knee valgus loading (88%). Additionally, 64% of injuries occurred in the first half of matches and most frequently within the first 30 minutes. Conclusion: Female athletes showed remarkable similarities with elite male players in terms of the ACL mechanism and situational pattern of injury, and 88% of injuries involved no direct contact to the knee, with noncontact injuries being highly prevalent. Injuries occurred during 3 main situations, with accompanying alterations in multiplanar biomechanics. Interventions aimed at reducing ACL injuries in women’s soccer should consider high-intensity defensive play at the beginning of a match. Instruction in the 3 main situations should be applied alongside appropriate neuromuscular training interventions.","The paper provides a systematic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in professional female soccer players, highlighting the prevalence and mechanisms of these injuries. Key findings indicate that a significant majority of ACL injuries are noncontact, occurring primarily during high-intensity defensive actions in the first half of matches, with implications for targeted injury prevention strategies."
Landing Error Scoring System for Screening Risk Scores among Elite-Youth Soccer Players,2021-05-14,,,,"Identifying the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury is very important for the careers of elite players. When identifying risk factors, effective, easy, valid, reliable methods applicable to a large number of participants should be used. The purpose of this study was to compare the landing pattern of elite-youth soccer players using the landing error scoring system (LESS) which is a valid and reliable qualitative screening method. 95 volunteer elite-youth soccer players (U19, U17, U16 &amp; U15) between the ages of 14 and 18 participated in this study. Jump-landings were recorded by two camcorders from sagittal and frontal planes. These records were replayed and scored by a trained rater on LESS score sheets. There were statistically significant differences in LESS scores among the soccer age groups (p = 0.00). Post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant differences between U19 and U17 (p = 0.00), U17 and U15 (p = 0.00) and U16 and U15 (p = 0.01) soccer players. The best LESS score was found in U17 players and U15 players had the weakest score. The higher LESS score of the U15 players may be related to the neuromuscular control ability however, more evidence is needed to confirm the potential influence of age categories on LESS scores.","The paper examines the use of the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) to evaluate landing patterns and assess the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries among elite-youth soccer players aged 14 to 18. The study found significant differences in LESS scores across age groups, indicating varying levels of neuromuscular control, with U15 players showing the weakest performance."
"Biomechanical Aspects of the Foot Arch, Body Balance and Body Weight Composition of Boys Training Football",2021-05-10,,,,"Background: The aim of the study is to assess the body balance and podological parameters and body composition of young footballers in the context of the control of football training. Methods: The study examined the distribution of the pressure of the part of the foot on the ground, the arch of the foot, and the analysis of the body composition of the boys. The pressure center for both feet and the whole body was also examined. The study involved 90 youth footballers from Olsztyn and Barczewo in three age groups: 8–10 years, 11–13 years old, and 14–16 years. The study used the Inbody 270 body composition analyzer and the EPSR1, a mat that measures the pressure distribution of the feet on the ground. Results: The results showed statistically significant differences in almost every case for each area of the foot between the groups of the examined boys. The most significant differences were observed for the metatarsal area and the left heel. In the case of stabilization of the whole body, statistically significant differences were noted between all study groups. In the case of the body composition parameters, in the examined boys, a coherent direction of changes was noticed for most of them. The relationships and correlations between the examined parameters were also investigated. The significance level in the study was set at p &lt; 0.05. Conclusions: Under the training rigor, a statistically significant increase in stability was observed with age. The total length of the longitudinal arch of both feet of the examined boys showed a tendency to flatten in direct proportion to the age of the examined boys. Mean values of the body composition parameters reflect changes with the ontogenetic development, basic somatic parameters (body height and weight) and training experience, and thus with the intensity and volume of training. This indicates a correct training process that does not interfere with the proper development of the body in terms of tissue and biochemical composition.","This paper investigates the impact of football training on the foot arch, body balance, and body composition among young footballers across various age groups. The findings reveal significant differences in pressure distribution on the foot, stability, and body composition over time, indicating that proper training supports healthy physiological development in young athletes."
Effects of a neuromuscular training program using external focus attention cues in male athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized clinical trial,2021-05-08,,,,"Abstract Background Athletes who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction often exhibit persistent altered biomechanics and impaired function. Neuromuscular training programs appear to be effective for reducing high-risk landing mechanics and preventing primary ACL injuries; however, there have been few attempts to examine their effects in athletes who have undergone ACL reconstruction. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of a neuromuscular training program that emphasizes external focus of attention cuing on biomechanics, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function in athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation. Methods Twenty-four male athletes who had undergone primary, unilateral, hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation were randomly allocated to an experimental group ( n = 12) who took part in an 8-week neuromuscular training program or a control group ( n = 12) who continued a placebo program. The neuromuscular training program included lower extremity strengthening and plyometric exercises, balance training, and movement pattern re-training. Biomechanics during single-leg landing, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function were assessed before and after the 8-week training period. Results Athletes in the experimental group demonstrated increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion angles and decreased knee abduction, internal rotation angles and knee valgus during landing following the intervention. Further, the experimental group decreased their peak knee extension and abduction moments and vertical ground reaction force on landing post-intervention. International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire (IKDC) scores increased in the experimental group following training. The control group demonstrated no changes in any variable over the same time period. Conclusions Neuromuscular training with external focus of attention cueing improved landing biomechanics in patients after ACL reconstruction. Neuromuscular training programs beneficially mitigate second ACL injury risk factors and should be emphasized during and after traditional post-operative rehabilitation.

First-time anterior cruciate ligament injury in adolescent female elite athletes: a prospective cohort study to identify modifiable risk factors,2021-05-07,,,,"PURPOSE: To identify modifiable biomechanical and neuromuscular anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors for first-time ACL injury in adolescent female elite football and team handball players. METHODS: Adolescent female elite football and handball players with no previous ACL injury participated in the present study. At baseline, players were tested during side-cutting manoeuvres performed in a 3-dimensional motion analysis laboratory with concomitant electromyography (EMG) measurements. Maximal isometric lower limb muscle strength was assessed by handheld dynamometry. Players were prospectively followed for 2 years after baseline testing, and all magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) verified ACL injuries were registered. The effect of 16 risk factor candidates on the relative risk (RR) of ACL injury was estimated using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety players (age 16.9 ± 1.2 years) were included in the analyses. Nine first-time ACL injuries (injury incidence 10.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4-18.6%)) were registered during the 2-year follow-up period. Four risk factor candidates were significantly associated with the risk of ACL injury: (1) hip flexion angle at initial contact (IC) [RR 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.92], (2) internal knee rotation angle at IC [RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.19], (3) semitendinosus EMG activity 50 ms prior to IC [RR: 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89], and (4) external hip rotator strength [RR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89]. CONCLUSION: Four distinct ACL injury risk factors related to the side-cutting manoeuvre were identified in a population of adolescent female elite football and team handball players with no previous ACL injury. As ACL injury typically occur during side-cutting, intervention programmes to modify these risk factors pose a promising strategy for ACL injury prevention in adolescent female elite football and team handball. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.","This paper investigates modifiable risk factors for first-time anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in adolescent female elite football and team handball players. Key findings highlight four significant risk factors associated with ACL injury during side-cutting maneuvers, suggesting that targeted intervention programs could effectively reduce injury incidence in this population."
Effect of a simple core muscle training program on trunk muscle strength and neuromuscular control among pediatric soccer players,2021-05-06,,,,"Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of simple core muscle training (CMT) program on trunk muscle strength and neuromuscular control among pediatric athletes. Methods Forty-nine male soccer players (mean age, 10.8 years) participated. The CMT program had three components (bench, side bench, and Nordic hamstrings) and was performed at least three times weekly for a year. Trunk flexion/extension muscle strength and the K/H ratio (determined by dividing knee separation distance by hip separation distance during drop-jump test and used as an index of lower limb valgus alignment) were measured, and the Y balance test (YBT) was performed before and after intervention. This study did not include the pure control group among the same team. To consider the effect of CMT on trunk muscle strength due to physical growth, we used the data of trunk muscle strength from the local cohort study previously conducted in our institution. One hundred participants who matched the age, height, body weight, and body mass index of the training group was designated as a control group. Results In the training group, the trunk flexion/extension strength significantly increased at 6 months ( p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and 12 months ( p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) compared to initial value. The K/H ratio at initial contact and maximum knee flexion phase significantly increased at 6 months ( p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively); however, it did not increase at 12 months ( p = 0.384 and p = 0.070, respectively) compared to the initial value. In the YBT, the maximized reach distance in each direction significantly increased after intervention on both the dominant and non-dominant sides, except in the posteromedial direction on the non-dominant foot. Compared to the control group, although there was no significant difference in trunk flexion/extension strength at baseline ( p = 0.141 and p = 0.390, respectively), the training group showed significantly higher trunk flexion/extension muscle strength at 12 months ( p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Conclusion The CMT program increased trunk muscle strength and improved dynamic balance among pediatric male athletes. Level of evidence Level II","This study investigates the impact of a structured core muscle training program on trunk muscle strength and neuromuscular control in pediatric soccer players. Findings indicate significant improvements in trunk muscle strength and dynamic balance, as evidenced by increased strength and performance on the Y balance test after 12 months of training."
Physiological Monitoring Detected Changes During Women's Soccer Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,2021-05-04,,,,"A growing number of studies utilizing wearable technologies are examining the influence of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on intense training, recovery, and injury risk. Exercise biometric (EB) data were collected on collegiate, female soccer players during a preseason camp. One player sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Baseline anthropometric and EB data were compared to non-injured, position-matched teammates.","This paper investigates the use of wearable technologies to monitor physiological changes in female soccer players, focusing on the impact of the autonomic nervous system on training, recovery, and injury risk.

Limb preference impacts single‐leg forward hop limb symmetry index values following ACL reconstruction,2021-05-02,,,,"Following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction limb dominance for performing tasks is not considered when making rehabilitation progression decisions. The purpose of this study was to determine if strength and functional outcomes differ between individuals who injured their preferred or nonpreferred jumping limb and to determine if these same outcomes differ between individuals who injured their preferred or nonpreferred limb used to kick a ball. A secondary purpose was to determine the association of quadriceps strength and single-leg forward hop performance with patient self-reported function. Forty individuals with ACL reconstruction (age = 20.0 ± 4.6 years, height = 174.2 ± 12.7 cm, mass = 71.2 ± 12.7 kg, time since surgery = 5.3 ± 0.8 months) were included in the study. Primary outcome measures included, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) scores, quadriceps limb symmetry index (LSI) values, and single-leg forward hop LSI values. Limb preference was defined two ways, kicking a ball and performing a unilateral jump. There were no significant differences between groups based on injury to the preferred limb to kick a ball for any of the outcome variables. Individuals who injured their nonpreferred jumping limb demonstrated significantly (p = 0.05, d = 0.77) lower single-leg forward hop LSI values (81.1% ± 19.5%) compared to individuals who injured their preferred jumping limb (94.1% ± 12.6%), but demonstrated no differences in IKDC scores or quadriceps LSI values. Quadriceps LSI and single-leg forward hop LSI explained 73% of the variance in IKDC scores, but quadriceps LSI had the strongest association (r = 0.790). These findings suggests that limb preference influences single forward hop LSI values and should be considered following ACL reconstruction.","This study investigates the impact of limb preference on rehabilitation outcomes following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, specifically examining single-leg forward hop performance and quadriceps strength. The findings indicate that individuals who injured their nonpreferred jumping limb have significantly lower hop symmetry index values compared to those who injured their preferred limb, highlighting the importance of considering limb dominance in post-surgery rehabilitation strategies."
Anterior cruciate ligament injury mechanisms through a neurocognition lens: implications for injury screening,2021-05-01,,,,"Athletes in team sports have to quickly visually perceive actions of opponents and teammates while executing their own movements. These continuous actions are performed under time pressure and may contribute to a non-contact ACL injury. However, ACL injury screening and prevention programmes are primarily based on standardised movements in a predictable environment. The sports environment provides much greater cognitive demand because athletes must attend their attention to numerous external stimuli and inhibit impulsive actions. Any deficit or delay in attentional processing may contribute to an inability to correct potential errors in complex coordination, resulting in knee positions that increase the ACL injury risk. In this viewpoint, we advocate that ACL injury screening should include the sports specific neurocognitive demands.","This paper discusses the mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in athletes, emphasizing the role of neurocognitive factors in team sports. It argues that traditional ACL injury screening and prevention methods, which focus on standardized movements, should be expanded to account for the cognitive demands faced by athletes in dynamic environments."
Incidence and Risk Factors for Residual High-Grade Pivot Shift After ACL Reconstruction With or Without a Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis,2021-05-01,,,,"Residual rotatory knee laxity at midterm follow-up after isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) versus ACLR with lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) remains an issue.To evaluate the outcomes of ACLR with or without additional LET at a minimum 2-year follow-up in patients with preoperative high-grade pivot shift (PS). Our hypothesis was that the addition of LET would decrease the risk of secondary meniscal injury and the presence of residual high-grade PS at follow-up.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.A retrospective analysis performed at 3 sports medicine centers identified 266 study patients; all had a high-grade PS (grade 2 or 3) preoperatively and underwent isolated ACLR with or without LET. Four different ACLR techniques were used: single-strand quadrupled semitendinosus (ST4) ACLR without LET (ST4 group; n = 55), ST4 with anatomic LET (ST4+LET group; n = 77), bone-patellar tendon and modified Lemaire LET (BTB+LET group; n = 43), and quadriceps tendon and modified Lemaire LET (QT+LET group; n = 91). At follow-up, we evaluated for the presence of high-grade (grade ≥2) PS. Preoperative meniscal tears and their treatment were recorded.Overall, 185 (69.5%) patients had at least 1 meniscal tear at index surgery. The mean follow-up period was 44.3 months; 47 (17.7%) patients had a new meniscal tear and 64 (24%) patients had a high-grade PS at follow-up. Compared with meniscal repair, significant predictors for high-grade PS at follow-up were meniscectomy (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65 [95% CI, 1.19-5.63]; P = .02) and nonrepair of preoperative meniscal tear (OR = 3.26 [95% CI, 1.27-9.43]; P = .007). The appearance of a new symptomatic meniscal tear was the strongest significant predictor of high-grade PS at follow-up (OR = 4.31 [95% CI, 2.31-8.06]; P < .001). No significant correlation was observed between the addition of LET and the presence of high-grade PS at follow-up.In the current study, 1 in 4 patients with high-grade PS before ACLR with or without LET was at risk of residual rotatory knee laxity at mean 44-month follow-up, regardless of the technique used. Repairing a pre-existing meniscal lesion was more effective than performing LET to decrease the presence of a high-grade PS at follow-up.","This paper evaluates the incidence and risk factors associated with residual high-grade pivot shift (PS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), with and without lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET), in patients with preoperative high-grade PS. The findings indicate that the occurrence of new meniscal tears and the repair status of preoperative meniscal tears significantly influence the presence of residual high-grade PS at midterm follow-up, while the addition of LET did not demonstrate a significant correlation with reduced PS."
Posterior oblique ligament of the knee: state of the art,2021-05-01,,,,"The posterior oblique ligament (POL) is the predominant ligamentous structure on the posterior medial corner of the knee joint. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, biomechanics, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of POL injuries will aid orthopaedic surgeons in the management of these injuries.The resulting rotational instability, in addition to valgus laxity, may not be tolerated by athletes participating in pivoting sports. The most common mechanism of injury - accounting for 72% of cases - is related to sports activity, particularly football, basketball and skiing. Moreover, three different injury patterns have been reported: those associated with injury to the capsular arm of the semimembranosus (SM), those involving a complete peripheral meniscal detachment and those involving disruption of the SM and peripheral meniscal detachment.The hallmark of an injury related to POL lesions is the presence of anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI), which is defined as 'external rotation with anterior subluxation of the medial tibial plateau relative to the distal femur'.In acute settings, POL lesions can be easily identified using coronal and axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and POL appear as separate structures. However, MRI is not sensitive in chronic cases.Surgical treatment of the medial side leads to satisfactory clinical results in a multi-ligamentous reconstruction scenario, but it is known to be associated with secondary stiffness.In young patients with high functional demands, return to sports is allowed no earlier than 9-12 months after they have undergone a thorough rehabilitation programme. Cite this article:","This paper provides an overview of the posterior oblique ligament (POL) of the knee, emphasizing its significance in the context of sports injuries, particularly in pivoting sports like football. Key points include the ligament's anatomy, common injury patterns associated with sports activities, diagnostic challenges with MRI, and guidelines for surgical treatment and rehabilitation in athletes."

Method: A total of 390 soccer players age (U13). From 14 Algerian soccer clubs were enrolled and subjected to standard anthropometric, fitness (speed 20m, CMJ, skills-related performance testing. The testing battery will be described as will the process for converting test data into standardized scores. Data will be presented to show the strengths and weaknesses of some players. Result: After analysing the results based on the standard criteria for the proposed tests as well as the overall performance variable. And the ability of each youth to be selected according to their potential, and therefore it was stressed that the proposed criteria, which are scientific support for the field observation, should be emphasized to facilitate this process for Algerian soccer players. The findings from this study indicate that marked improvements and parameters associated with physical maturity such as height, weight, speed, VO2max, or chronological age are important to determine the success of a soccer player. At older ages, other factors such as agility seem to be more important. Nevertheless, players born in the 1st semester of the year are also more frequent in the older teams.

A 90 Minute Soccer Match Induces Eccentric Hamstring Muscles Fatigue,2021-05-01,,,,"Background/Purpose of the study.Hamstring injuries are the most prevalent muscle injuries in both amateur and professional soccer (football) players.Eccentric strength deficits and muscle strength imbalances have been associated with an increased risk of muscle injuries.The current study is a non-randomised observational study investigating whether fatigue significantly reduces peak eccentric strength of the hamstring muscle group.Methods.Twenty-two right leg dominant professional football players participated in this study.None were injured or were rehabilitating from an injury at the time of testing.The eccentric strength of the hamstring muscles was determined using the Nordic exercise on a Norbord device prior to a 90 minute soccer match and after its end.Results.There was a significant decrease in eccentric strength at the end of the match (before the match: M = 306.91,SD = 59.26; after the match: mean = 277.77± SD = 60.35 p = .000,Cohen's d = .50).The imbalance in eccentric hamstring muscle strength between dominant and non-dominant limb before the match remained unchanged after its end.Conclusions.A professional football match significantly impacts on the ability of players to produce high speed eccentric strength in the hamstring muscle groups.Resistance to fatigue and eccentric strength, particularly at high speeds, are considerable factors in conditioning of professional soccer players.Eccentric muscle strength fatigue of the hamstring muscle group after a 90 min soccer match may provide a possible explanation for the greater risk of hamstring injuries under fatigue conditions.","This study investigates the impact of a 90-minute soccer match on the eccentric strength of the hamstring muscles in professional football players. The results indicate a significant reduction in peak eccentric strength post-match, highlighting the relationship between muscle fatigue and the increased risk of hamstring injuries, particularly at high speeds."
Most Impacting Injuries in Football: a Possible Association?,2021-05-01,,,,"Objective.Epidemiological studies on soccer injuries show that anterior cruciate ligament, groin, and hamstring injuries are heavily impacting availability, therefore medical research has focused on them.A certain number of studies have focused on the possible association between these three injuries.The aim of this study is to describe the possible association between these three injuries and to discuss their possible logical association.Methods.This study is based on the injury records of four international Qatar league players who suffered all these three injuries during their career.Our hypothesis is that these three injuries are related to each other through a cause-effect mechanism.Results.Based on the observational data of this study, the hypothesis that the anterior cruciate ligament, groin and hamstring injuries may be associated with each other can be advanced.This hypothesis is based on both anatomical and functional justifications.Conclusions.Being our knowledge of the pathophysiology and factors predisposing athletes to muscle, tendon and articular injury is still limited, the consequences of another type of injury on the athlete's overall injury risk profile have probably been underestimated or not correctly understood.Further studies are necessary to clarify this cause-effect relation and this study also represents a call for action for future researches in this area.","This paper investigates the potential association between anterior cruciate ligament, groin, and hamstring injuries in football players, based on injury records from four international Qatar league athletes.

Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Athletes: A Review,2021-04-30,,,,"Soccer is becoming an increasingly popular sport amongst women. Common movements during play, such as jumping and cutting, require rapid acceleration and deceleration of multiple lower-limb joints. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which contributes to stabilization of the knee, is often injured during these events. ACL injury typically requires costly surgery, extended time away from sports, and jeopardizes long-term joint health. Due to sex-specific factors such as menstruation and anatomical disadvantages, women are more susceptible to tearing their ACL. Injury often occurs in non-contact scenarios during rapid acceleration or deceleration movements. Research has examined these movements and established several kinematic and kinetic mechanisms as well as muscle activation patterns that frequently occur at the time of injury, however results tend to vary based on population. This article summarizes recent and relevant literature of ACL injury mechanisms and highlights the lack of specific research in the high-risk female soccer athlete population. Due to inconclusive risk factors, injury prevention programs within this population have been inconsistent. ACL injury risk for female soccer athletes should be closer examined so that more specific injury risks can be established, and effective protective measures can be taken. Raised awareness of this need may capture attention in the research and medical communities and potentially stimulate the development of strategies that limit future ACL injury and thus the challenges it brings to the high-risk female soccer athlete.","This paper reviews the heightened risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female soccer athletes, emphasizing the impact of gender-specific factors and common movement patterns in the sport.

ACL injury prevention: Where have we come from and where are we going?,2021-04-29,,,,"Abstract Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common and severe knee injuries across sports. As such, ACL injury prevention has been a focus of research and sports medicine practice for the past three‐plus decades. Examining the current research and identifying both clinical strategies and research gaps, the aim of this review is to empower clinicians and researchers with knowledge of where the ACL injury prevention literature is currently and where it is going in the future. This paper examines the mechanism of ACL injury prevention, screening, implementation, compliance, adherence, coronavirus, and areas of future research. Clinical significance: The time lag between research and practical implementation in general healthcare settings can be as long as 17 years; however, athletes playing sports today are unable to wait that long. With effective programs already established, implementation and adherence to these programs is essential. Strategies such as coaching education, increasing awareness of free programs, identifying barriers, and overcoming implementation obstacles through creative collaboration are just a few ways that could help improve both ACL injury prevention implementation and adherence.","This paper reviews the evolution of ACL injury prevention research and its practical applications in sports medicine over the past three decades. It highlights the mechanisms of injury prevention, the importance of timely implementation of established programs, and strategies to enhance adherence and compliance among athletes."
A 2D video-analysis scoring system of 90° change of direction technique identifies football players with high knee abduction moment,2021-04-29,,,,"Abnormal joint biomechanics and poor neuromuscular control are modifiable risk factors for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury. Although 3D motion capture is the gold standard for the biomechanical evaluation of high-speed multidirectional movements, 2D video analysis is a growing-interest alternative because of its higher cost-effectiveness and interpretability. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible association between a 2D evaluation of a 90° change of direction (COD) and the KAM measured with gold standard 3D motion analysis.Thirty-four competitive football (soccer) players (age 22.8 ± 4.1, 18 male and 16 females) were enrolled. Each athlete performed a series of pre-planned 90° COD at the maximum speed possible in a laboratory equipped with artificial turf. 3D motion analysis was recorded using 10 stereophotogrammetric cameras, a force platform, and three high-speed cameras. The 2D evaluation was performed through a scoring system based on the video analysis of frontal and sagittal plane joint kinematics. Five scoring criteria were adopted: limb stability (LS), pelvis stability (PS), trunk stability (TS), shock absorption (SA), and movement strategy (MS). For each criterion, a sub-score of 0/2 (non-adequate), 1/2 (partially adequate), or 2/2 (adequate) was attributed to the movement, based on objective measurements. The intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated for each criterion and the total score. The Knee Abduction Moment (KAM) was extracted from the 3D motion analysis and grouped according to the results of the 2D evaluation.Excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC > 0.88) and good-to-excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.68-0.92) were found. Significantly higher KAM was found for athletes obtaining a 0/2 score compared to those obtaining a 2/2 score in all the sub-criteria and the total score (20-47% higher, p < 0.05). The total score and the LS score showed the best discriminative power between the three groups.The 2D video-analysis scoring system here described was a simple and effective tool to discriminate athletes with high and low KAM in the assessment of a 90° COD and could be a potential method to identify athletes at high risk of non-contact ACL injury.IV.","The paper presents a novel 2D video-analysis scoring system designed to assess the 90° change of direction technique in football players and identify athletes at risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries.

From the Laboratory to the Field: IMU-Based Shot and Pass Detection in Football Training and Game Scenarios Using Deep Learning,2021-04-28,,,,"The applicability of sensor-based human activity recognition in sports has been repeatedly shown for laboratory settings. However, the transferability to real-world scenarios cannot be granted due to limitations on data and evaluation methods. On the example of football shot and pass detection against a null class we explore the influence of those factors for real-world event classification in field sports. For this purpose we compare the performance of an established Support Vector Machine (SVM) for laboratory settings from literature to the performance in three evaluation scenarios gradually evolving from laboratory settings to real-world scenarios. In addition, three different types of neural networks, namely a convolutional neural net (CNN), a long short term memory net (LSTM) and a convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) are compared. Results indicate that the SVM is not able to reliably solve the investigated three-class problem. In contrast, all deep learning models reach high classification scores showing the general feasibility of event detection in real-world sports scenarios using deep learning. The maximum performance with a weighted f1-score of 0.93 was reported by the CNN. The study provides valuable insights for sports assessment under practically relevant conditions. In particular, it shows that (1) the discriminative power of established features needs to be reevaluated when real-world conditions are assessed, (2) the selection of an appropriate dataset and evaluation method are both required to evaluate real-world applicability and (3) deep learning-based methods yield promising results for real-world HAR in sports despite high variations in the execution of activities.","This paper investigates the application of deep learning models for detecting shots and passes in football, comparing their performance in laboratory versus real-world scenarios. Key findings highlight that traditional Support Vector Machines are ineffective in real-world settings, while deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks, demonstrate high classification accuracy, underlining the necessity of adapting evaluation methods for practical sports applications."

The Hammer and the Nail: Biomechanics of Striking and Struck Canadian University Football Players,2021-04-23,,,,"This study sought to evaluate head accelerations in both players involved in a football collision. Players on two opposing Canadian university teams were equipped with helmet mounted sensors during one game per season, for two consecutive seasons. A total of 276 collisions between 58 instrumented players were identified via video and cross-referenced with sensor timestamps. Player involvement (striking and struck), impact type (block or tackle), head impact location (front, back, left and right), and play type were recorded from video footage. While struck players did not experience significantly different linear or rotational accelerations between any play types, striking players had the highest linear and rotational head accelerations during kickoff plays (p ≤ .03). Striking players also experienced greater linear and rotational head accelerations than struck players during kickoff plays (p = .001). However, struck players experienced greater linear and rotational accelerations than striking players during kick return plays (p ≤ .008). Other studies have established that the more severe the head impact, the greater risk for injury to the brain. This paper's results highlight that kickoff play rule changes, as implemented in American college football, would decrease head impact exposure of Canadian university football athletes and make the game safer.","This study examines head accelerations in collisions between Canadian university football players, utilizing helmet-mounted sensors to gather data over two seasons.

Differences in Biomechanical Loading Magnitude During a Landing Task in Male Athletes With and Those Without Patellar Tendinopathy,2021-04-22,,,,"Context Researchers have not established if overloading or underloading movement profiles are present in symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes with patellar tendon structural abnormality (PTA) compared with healthy athletes. Objective To compare involved-limb landing biomechanics between male athletes with and those without patellar tendinopathy. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 43 male athletes were grouped based on patellar tendon pain and ultrasound imaging of the proximal patellar tendon: symptomatic with PTA (SYM; n = 13; age = 19.62 ± 1.61 years, height = 1.82 ± 0.05 m, mass = 83.46 ± 5.12 kg), asymptomatic with PTA (ASYM; n = 15; age = 21.13 ± 1.88 years, height = 1.84 ± 0.07 m, mass = 81.45 ± 13.26 kg), and healthy control (CON; n = 15; age = 19.60 ± 1.55 years, height = 1.84 ± 0.09 m, mass = 79.09 ± 12.37 kg). Main Outcome Measure(s) Three-dimensional biomechanics were collected during a double-limb jump-landing task. Kinematic (knee-flexion angle [KF]) and kinetic (vertical ground reaction force, internal knee-extension moment [KEM], patellar tendon force [FPT]) variables were analyzed as continuous waveforms during the stance phase for the involved limb. Mean values were calculated for each 1% of stance, normalized over 202 data points (0%–100%), and plotted with 95% CIs. Statistical significance was defined as a lack of 95% CI overlap for a minimum of a consecutive 3% of the stance phase. Results The SYM group had less KF than the CON group throughout the stance phase (8%–76%: Cohen d = 1.14 ± 0.12, mean difference [MD] = 15.83° ± 2.71°). The ASYM group had less KF than the CON group in the early (8%–13%: Cohen d = 0.99 ± 0.04, MD = 7.99° ± 0.39°; 21%–24%: Cohen d = 1.01 ± 0.01, MD = 11.11° ± 0.32°) and late (74%–94%: Cohen d = 0.96 ± 0.07, MD = 9.55° ± 1.13°) stance phases. The SYM group had a smaller KEM (6.5%–9%: Cohen d = 1.21 ± 0.08, MD = 0.04 ± 0.004 N·m/[Nbw·mht]) and less FPT (6%–9%: Cohen d = 1.15 ± 0.15, MD = 0.85 ± 0.15 body weight) than the CON group in the early stance phase. The SYM group also displayed a smaller KEM (38%–56%: Cohen d = 1.17 ± 0.06, MD = 0.03 ± 0.001 N·m/[Nbw·mht]) and less FPT (36%–60%: Cohen d = 1.22 ± 0.08, MD = 0.66 ± 0.05 body weight) than the ASYM group in the midstance phase. Conclusions The SYM group demonstrated a patellar tendon load-avoidance profile compared with the ASYM and CON groups. The ASYM group showed no evidence of overloading compared with the CON group. Our findings support the need for individualized treatments for athletes with tendinopathy to maximize load capacity.","This paper investigates the differences in landing biomechanics among male athletes with patellar tendinopathy compared to those without, focusing on kinematic and kinetic variables during a double-limb jump-landing task.

Less is More: End-to-end Learning of Insights from a Single Motion Sensor for Accurate and Explainable Soccer Goalkeeper Kinematics,2021-04-22,,,,"On-field sensor-based soccer player tracking solutions are emerging and provide new insights into the dynamics of the player during training or a match. Yet, not all player positions are equally privileged. Goalkeepersâ training and performance assess- ment were for a long time ignored. Understanding what is âthe side of the post where most high dives were performedâ provides valuable input for both the trainer and the athlete to improve perfor- mance or avoid injuries. In the current study, we focus on a practical methodology to extract insights from goalkeeper kinematics to inform such analytics. We demonstrate that information from a single motion sensor can be successfully used for learning patterns in goalkeeperâs motion and provide an explainable goalkeeper kine- matics assessment. We employed raw and quaternions data and we evaluated a series of machine learning algorithms that discriminate dive types (i.e. binary classification) and dives from other types of specific motions (i.e. multi-class classification) directly from the data. Our results demonstrate that XGBoost outperforms other approaches in terms of performance when considering both raw and quaternions, essentially benefiting from both types of data. Additionally, each prediction of the model is accompanied by an explanation of how each sensed motion component contributes to describing a specific goalkeeperâs action captured by the model. The explainable predictions along with the efficient deployment of XGboost were decisive in our applied study. We evaluated our methodology on a first batch of experiments using online available data from 7 goalkeepers during 30 minutes-long training sessions.","This paper presents a methodology utilizing a single motion sensor to analyze and extract insights from the kinematics of soccer goalkeepers during training.

Reduction of Risk Factors for ACL Re-injuries using an Innovative Biofeedback Approach: Rationale and Design,2021-04-20,,,,"Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries with 90% of these athletes electing to undergo an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) at an estimated annual cost of $3 billion. While ACLR and subsequent rehabilitation allow these athletes to return to sports, they have a 15-fold increased risk of second ACL injuries. The modification of post-operative rehabilitation to improve movement and loading symmetry using visual and tactile biofeedback could decrease the risk factors for sustaining a second ACL injury. Participants included 40 adolescent ACLR patients who were intending to return to full sport participation. This preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the changes in knee extension moment symmetry, a known risk factor for second ACL injuries, during landing from a stop-jump task between the following time-points: pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and subsequent follow-up 6-weeks post-intervention. Participants met twice per week for six-weeks (12-session). The intervention included bilateral squat biofeedback (visual and tactile); the attention control group attended weekly educational sessions. This RCT enrolled and randomize 40 participants over a two-and-a-half-year period. All participants were greater than 4.5 months post-op from a primary, unilateral ACLR and were released to participate by their treating physician. The findings from this pilot biofeedback RCT will provide critical effect size estimates for use in subsequent larger clinical trials.","This paper investigates the use of a biofeedback intervention to modify post-operative rehabilitation practices for adolescent athletes recovering from ACL reconstruction, aiming to reduce the risk of re-injury. The study involves a randomized controlled trial with 40 participants, focusing on changes in knee extension moment symmetry during a specific landing task, indicating potential benefits for future clinical trials in improving rehabilitation outcomes."
Modulators of Change-of-Direction Economy After Repeated Sprints in Elite Soccer Players,2021-04-19,,,,"To investigate the acute effect of repeated-sprint activity (RSA) on change-of-direction economy (assessed using shuttle running economy [SRE]) in soccer players and explore neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory characteristics that may modulate this effect.Eleven young elite male soccer players (18.5 [1.4] y old) were tested on 2 different days during a 2-week period in their preseason. On day 1, lower-body stiffness, power and force were assessed via countermovement jumps, followed by an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion to measure maximal aerobic capacity. On day 2, 2 SRE tests were performed before and after a repeated-sprint protocol with heart rate, minute ventilation, and blood lactate measured.Pooled group analysis indicated no significant changes for SRE following RSA due to variability in individual responses, with a potentiation or impairment effect of up to 4.5% evident across soccer players. The SRE responses to RSA were significantly and largely correlated to players' lower-body stiffness (r = .670; P = .024), and moderately (but not significantly) correlated to players' force production (r = -.455; P = .237) and blood lactate after RSA (r = .327; P = .326).In summary, SRE response to RSA in elite male soccer players appears to be highly individual. Higher lower-body stiffness appears as a relevant physical contributor to preserve or improve SRE following RSA.","This paper investigates the effects of repeated-sprint activity on change-of-direction economy in elite soccer players, assessing various neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory characteristics. The findings reveal that individual responses to repeated sprints vary significantly, with lower-body stiffness showing a strong correlation to shuttle running economy outcomes."
Biceps Femoris Compensates for Semitendinosus After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With a Hamstring Autograft: A Muscle Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study in Male Soccer Players,2021-04-16,,,,"Background: Rates of reinjury, return to play (RTP) at the preinjury level, and hamstring strain injuries in male soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) remain unsatisfactory, due to multifactorial causes. Recent insights on intramuscular hamstring coordination revealed the semitendinosus (ST) to be of crucial importance for hamstring functioning, especially during heavy eccentric hamstring loading. Scientific evidence on the consequences of ST tendon harvest for ACLR is scarce and inconsistent. This study intended to investigate the repercussions of ST harvest for ACLR on hamstring muscle function. Hypothesis: Harvest of the ST tendon for ACLR was expected to have a significant influence on hamstring muscle activation patterns during eccentric exercises, evaluated at RTP in a population of male soccer athletes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 30 male soccer players with a history of ACLR who were cleared for RTP and 30 healthy controls were allocated to this study during the 2018-2019 soccer season. The influence of ACLR on hamstring muscle activation patterns was assessed by comparing the change in T2 relaxation times [ΔT2 (%) = [Formula: see text]] of the hamstring muscle tissue before and after an eccentric hamstring loading task between athletes with and without a recent history of ACLR through use of muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging, induced by an eccentric hamstring loading task between scans. Results: Significantly higher exercise-related activity was observed in the biceps femoris (BF) of athletes after ACLR compared with uninjured control athletes (13.92% vs 8.48%; P = .003), whereas the ST had significantly lower activity (19.97% vs 25.32%; P = .049). Significant differences were also established in a within-group comparison of the operated versus the contralateral leg in the ACLR group (operated vs nonoperated leg: 14.54% vs 11.63% for BF [ P = .000], 17.31% vs 22.37% for ST [ P = .000], and 15.64% vs 13.54% for semimembranosus [SM] [ P = .014]). Neither the muscle activity of SM and gracilis muscles nor total posterior thigh muscle activity (sum of exercise-related ΔT2 of the BF, ST, and SM muscles) presented any differences in individuals who had undergone ACLR with an ST tendon autograft compared with healthy controls. Conclusion: These findings indicate that ACLR with a ST tendon autograft might notably influence the function of the hamstring muscles and, in particular, their hierarchic dimensions under fatiguing loading circumstances, with increases in relative BF activity contribution and decreases in relative ST activity after ACLR. This between-group difference in hamstring muscle activation pattern suggests that the BF partly compensates for deficient ST function in eccentric loading. These alterations might have implications for athletic performance and injury risk and should probably be considered in rehabilitation and hamstring injury prevention after ACLR with a ST tendon autograft.","This study investigates the effects of harvesting the semitendinosus (ST) tendon during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) on the activation patterns of hamstring muscles in male soccer players. Findings reveal that after ACLR, there is increased activity in the biceps femoris (BF) and decreased activity in the ST, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in muscle function which may impact athletic performance and injury risk during rehabilitation."
Clinical Risk Profile for a Second Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Players After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2021-04-15,,,,"Background: The risk of a second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury when participating in pivoting sports after ACL reconstruction is high. Risk factors associated with a second ACL injury are complex. Purpose: To investigate the combinations of various clinical risk factors associated with second ACL injury in female soccer players with a primary unilateral ACL reconstruction, using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 117 active female soccer players (mean ± SD age, 20 ± 2 years) were included. Athletes were enrolled 19 ± 9 months after ACL reconstruction and were prospectively followed for 2 years. At baseline, all players underwent assessment of knee and ankle joint range of motion (ROM), participated in functional tests (postural control, hop performance, and movement asymmetries in the lower limbs and trunk), and answered questionnaires (patient-reported knee function, knee-related quality of life, psychological and personality factors). A clinical prediction model using CART was developed. Results: A total of 28 players (24%) sustained a second ACL injury (21 ipsilateral and 7 contralateral ruptures) while playing soccer. CART analysis selected 9 of 19 independent variables associated with second ACL injury: the 5-jump test, knee collapse on the non–ACL reconstructed leg in a drop vertical jump, tuck jump, limb symmetry index on side hop and the single hop for distance, side difference in ankle dorsiflexion ROM, and scores for the questionnaires ACL-Return to Sport After Injury and the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality subscales of Stress Susceptibility and Adventure Seeking. The accuracy of the model was 89%, with 100% sensitivity and 76% specificity. CART analysis indicated that the interaction of longer jumps in the 5-jump test (&gt;916 cm) with more side difference in ankle dorsiflexion ROM (&gt;–2.5°) and more knee valgus collapse in the nonreconstructed knee (&gt;−1.4 cm) (relative risk, 4.03; 95% CI, 2.21-7.36) best predicted an increased likelihood of a second ACL injury. Conclusion: The risk profiles selected by CART could accurately identify female soccer players at high risk for a second ACL injury. There was an interaction between functional performance, clinical assessment, and psychological factors, and it is reasonable to include these factors in return-to-sport decisions and in athlete screening after ACL injury.","This paper investigates the clinical risk factors associated with a second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in female soccer players following ACL reconstruction, utilizing Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. Key findings reveal that certain performance and psychological assessments, along with joint range of motion, can significantly predict the likelihood of reinjury, highlighting the importance of these factors in return-to-sport strategies and athlete screening."
Machine learning methods in sport injury prediction and prevention: a systematic review,2021-04-14,,,,"Abstract Purpose Injuries are common in sports and can have significant physical, psychological and financial consequences. Machine learning (ML) methods could be used to improve injury prediction and allow proper approaches to injury prevention. The aim of our study was therefore to perform a systematic review of ML methods in sport injury prediction and prevention. Methods A search of the PubMed database was performed on March 24th 2020. Eligible articles included original studies investigating the role of ML for sport injury prediction and prevention. Two independent reviewers screened articles, assessed eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Methodological quality and risk of bias were determined by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Study quality was evaluated using the GRADE working group methodology. Results Eleven out of 249 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Different ML methods were used (tree-based ensemble methods ( n = 9), Support Vector Machines ( n = 4), Artificial Neural Networks ( n = 2)). The classification methods were facilitated by preprocessing steps ( n = 5) and optimized using over- and undersampling methods ( n = 6), hyperparameter tuning ( n = 4), feature selection ( n = 3) and dimensionality reduction ( n = 1). Injury predictive performance ranged from poor (Accuracy = 52%, AUC = 0.52) to strong (AUC = 0.87, f1-score = 85%). Conclusions Current ML methods can be used to identify athletes at high injury risk and be helpful to detect the most important injury risk factors. Methodological quality of the analyses was sufficient in general, but could be further improved. More effort should be put in the interpretation of the ML models.","The paper conducts a systematic review of machine learning methods aimed at enhancing injury prediction and prevention in sports, highlighting the effectiveness of various ML techniques such as tree-based ensemble methods, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks. The study identifies a range of injury predictive performances, indicating the current methods can effectively pinpoint athletes at high risk of injury while suggesting improvements for methodological quality and interpretation of ML models."

Physiological Characteristics of Female Soccer Players and Health and Performance Considerations: A Narrative Review,2021-04-12,,,,"Abstract Female soccer has seen a substantial rise in participation, as well as increased financial support from governing bodies over the last decade. Thus, there is an onus on researchers and medical departments to develop a better understanding of the physical characteristics and demands, and the health and performance needs of female soccer players. In this review, we discuss the current research, as well as the knowledge gaps, of six major topics: physical demands, talent identification, body composition, injury risk and prevention, health and nutrition. Data on female talent identification are scarce, and future studies need to elucidate the influence of relative age and maturation selection across age groups. Regarding the physical demands, more research is needed on the pattern of high-intensity sprinting during matches and the contribution of soccer-specific movements. Injuries are not uncommon in female soccer players, but targeting intrinsically modifiable factors with injury prevention programmes can reduce injury rates. The anthropometric and physical characteristics of female players are heterogeneous and setting specific targets should be discouraged in youth and sub-elite players. Menstrual cycle phase may influence performance and injury risk; however, there are few studies in soccer players. Nutrition plays a critical role in health and performance and ensuring adequate energy intake remains a priority. Despite recent progress, there is considerably less research in female than male soccer players. Many gaps in our understanding of how best to develop and manage the health and performance of female soccer players remain.","This paper reviews the physiological characteristics and health-performance considerations specific to female soccer players, highlighting the need for more research in areas such as physical demands, injury prevention, and nutrition. It identifies several knowledge gaps, including the lack of data on talent identification and the influence of factors like menstrual cycles on performance and injury risk."
High rate of second ACL injury following ACL reconstruction in male professional footballers: an updated longitudinal analysis from 118 players in the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study,2021-04-12,,,,"Studies on subsequent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and career length in male professional football players after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) are scarce.To investigate the second ACL injury rate, potential predictors of second ACL injury and the career length after ACLR.Prospective cohort study.Men's professional football.118 players with index ACL injury were tracked longitudinally for subsequent ACL injury and career length over 16.9 years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis with HR was carried out to study potential predictors for subsequent ACL injury.Median follow-up was 4.3 (IQR 4.6) years after ACLR. The second ACL injury rate after return to training (RTT) was 17.8% (n=21), with 9.3% (n=11) to the ipsilateral and 8.5% (n=10) to the contralateral knee. Significant predictors for second ACL injury were a non-contact index ACL injury (HR 7.16, 95% CI 1.63 to 31.22) and an isolated index ACL injury (HR 2.73, 95% CI 1.06 to 7.07). In total, 11 of 26 players (42%) with a non-contact isolated index ACL injury suffered a second ACL injury. RTT time was not an independent predictor of second ACL injury, even though there was a tendency for a risk reduction with longer time to RTT. Median career length after ACLR was 4.1 (IQR 4.0) years and 60% of players were still playing at preinjury level 5 years after ACLR.Almost one out of five top-level professional male football players sustained a second ACL injury following ACLR and return to football, with a considerably increased risk for players with a non-contact or isolated index injury.","This paper investigates the rate of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries following ACL reconstruction in male professional footballers, analyzing 118 players over an average of 4.3 years.

Effect of ball inclusion on jump performance in soccer players: a biomechanical approach,2021-04-09,,,,"In soccer, vertical jump means jumping toward a ball. Since no vertical jump test includes the ball as a reference element, the effect that the ball would have in a vertical jump test is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the biomechanical differences between run-up vertical jump measurements without (Run-up Vertical Jump) and with ball inclusion (Heading Test).Twelve semi- and professional soccer players were recruited. Athletes performed both jump tests in a biomechanical laboratory, where kinetic and spatiotemporal variables were collected and compared using a Student's dependent t-test for paired samples.Overall, players performed a different jumping strategy during the heading test compared to the run-up vertical jump, exhibiting: 1) higher horizontal velocity during initial contact (+45.3%, P ≤ .001), 2) shorter contact time, greater rate of force development, and total impulse during push-off (+27.5%, +53%, and +10.6%, respectively, P ≤ .008), 3) higher CoM horizontal and resultant velocity during take-off (+76.1% and 20.5%, respectively, P ≤ .001), 4) better vertical jump performance (+4.3%, P ≤ .0001), and 5) larger body angle rotation during landing (+63.3%, P = .006), compared to run-up vertical jump (effect size: 0.78 to 3.7).In general, soccer players display greater vertical jump heights in heading test, which highlights the importance of including an overhead ball during soccer-specific jump tests. Coaches and practitioners are encouraged to assess, and perhaps develop, the jumping ability of soccer players using a suspended ball as a specific target.","The paper investigates the impact of ball inclusion on vertical jump performance in soccer players by comparing jump tests with and without a ball. The results reveal significant biomechanical differences, indicating that soccer-specific jump tests that include a ball lead to higher jump heights and altered jumping strategies, emphasizing the need for tailored assessments in training."
Neuromuscular fatigue and recovery after strenuous exercise depends on skeletal muscle size and stem cell characteristics,2021-04-08,,,,"Abstract Hamstring muscle injury is highly prevalent in sports involving repeated maximal sprinting. Although neuromuscular fatigue is thought to be a risk factor, the mechanisms underlying the fatigue response to repeated maximal sprints are unclear. Here, we show that repeated maximal sprints induce neuromuscular fatigue accompanied with a prolonged strength loss in hamstring muscles. The immediate hamstring strength loss was linked to both central and peripheral fatigue, while prolonged strength loss was associated with indicators of muscle damage. The kinematic changes immediately after sprinting likely protected fatigued hamstrings from excess elongation stress, while larger hamstring muscle physiological cross-sectional area and lower myoblast:fibroblast ratio appeared to protect against fatigue/damage and improve muscle recovery within the first 48 h after sprinting. We have therefore identified novel mechanisms that likely regulate the fatigue/damage response and initial recovery following repeated maximal sprinting in humans.","This paper investigates the effects of repeated maximal sprinting on neuromuscular fatigue and recovery in hamstring muscles, highlighting the role of muscle size and stem cell characteristics. Key findings indicate that neuromuscular fatigue leads to immediate and prolonged strength loss, with larger muscle cross-sectional area and favorable myoblast:fibroblast ratios contributing to improved recovery."
The effects of a high-intensity exercise bout on landing biomechanics post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a quasi-experimental study,2021-04-07,,,,"Abstract Background We aimed to examine the effect of a high-intensity exercise bout on landing biomechanics in soccer players who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and non-injured soccer players during a soccer-specific landing maneuver. Methods Eighteen soccer players who underwent ACLR and 18 normal soccer players were enrolled in this investigation (ACLR group; age, 26.11 ± 3.95 years; body mass index, 23.52 ± 2.69 kg/m 2 ; surgery time, 5 ± 3.30 years: control group; age, 25.83 ± 3.51 years; body mass index, 24.09 ± 3.73 kg/m 2 , respectively). Participants were evaluated during the landing maneuver before and after carrying out the high-intensity exercise bout using the Wingate test. The intensity of the exercise was defined as a blood lactate accumulation of at least 4 mmol/L. The dependent variables included sagittal-plane kinematics and kinetics of the ankle, knee and hip joints, and electromyography activity of the gastrocnemius, hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteus maximus. Results On 2 × 2 analysis of variance, none of the dependent variable showed significant exercise×group interactions. Regardless of group, significant main effects of exercise were found. Post-exercise landing was characterized by increased flexion of hip ( p = 0.01), knee ( p = 0.001), and ankle joints ( p = 0.002); increased extension moments of hip ( p = 0.009), knee ( p = 0.012), and ankle joints ( p = 0.003), as well as decreased quadriceps activity ( p = 0.007). Conclusion At 1 year or more post-ACLR, the effect of the high-intensity exercise bout on landing biomechanics is not expected to differ from that experienced by healthy soccer players.","This paper investigates the impact of a high-intensity exercise bout on landing biomechanics among soccer players who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) compared to non-injured players. Key findings reveal that after high-intensity exercise, both groups exhibited increased flexion in hip, knee, and ankle joints, heightened extension moments, and reduced quadriceps activity, suggesting similar biomechanical responses to exercise in both groups at least one year post-reconstruction."
Quantifying change of direction load using positional data from small-sided games in soccer,2021-04-06,,,,"Quantifying change of direction (COD) load through positional data from small-sided games (SSG) and assess its criterion and construct validity.Elite male youth soccer players (n = 25, 16.8 ± 1.3 years) played three SSG (5v5, 5×4 min) with different field dimensions (small [40×30 m], medium [55×38 m], large [70×45 m]). Positional data of the players was obtained with a Local Position Measurement system. COD load (AU) was quantified based on the combination of velocity and change in heading direction. Additionally, total distance covered, running distance, acceleration count, deceleration count, and Rating of Perceived Exertion were measured. Criterion validity was assessed by correlating COD load and the load indicators. Construct validity was determined by testing the differences between the SSG field dimensions.Strong correlations were determined between COD load and total distance covered (r = 0.74, p < .01) and running distance (r = 0.84, p < .01). Middle and large field size resulted in highest COD load (p < .05).These results suggest that the COD load measure shows sufficient criterion and construct validity.","This paper focuses on quantifying change of direction (COD) load in elite youth soccer players using positional data from small-sided games (SSG). The study found strong correlations between COD load and total distance covered, indicating that different field sizes significantly affect COD load, thereby establishing the criterion and construct validity of the COD load measure."
A new open-access platform for measuring and sharing mTBI data,2021-04-05,,,,"Abstract Despite numerous research efforts, the precise mechanisms of concussion have yet to be fully uncovered. Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as contact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link between impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable sensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions operating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share these data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in the development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts forth two contributions: (1) a centralized, open-access platform for storing and sharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and (2) a deep learning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head impacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated instrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with FITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model, improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91% accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football head impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative research tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating a standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.","This paper presents an open-access platform designed for the measurement and sharing of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) data, specifically focusing on concussion mechanisms in contact sports athletes. It introduces a centralized system for head impact data storage and a deep learning algorithm, MiGNet, that demonstrates 96% accuracy in detecting true head impacts, thereby enhancing the understanding of concussion biomechanics and supporting collaborative research efforts."
Incorporating Internal and External Training Load Measurements in Clinical Decision Making After ACL Reconstruction: A Clinical Commentary,2021-04-01,,,,"Poor outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLr), including the relatively high risk of suffering a subsequent ACL injury, suggest the need to optimize rehabilitation and return-to-sport testing. The purpose of this commentary is to introduce clinicians to the concept of monitoring training load during rehabilitation, to review methods of quantifying internal and external loads, and to suggest ways that these technologies can be incorporated into rehabilitation progressions and return-to-sport decisions after anterior ACLr.Quantifying and identifying the effects of training load variables, external (distance, impacts, decelerations) and internal (heart rate, heart rate variability) workload, during rehabilitation can indicate both positive (improved physical, physiological, or psychological capacity) or negative (heightened risk for injury or illness) adaptations and allow for the ideal progression of exercise prescription. When used during return-to-sport testing, wearable technology can provide robust measures of movement quality, readiness, and asymmetry not identified during performance-based testing.Researchers have reported the actual in-game demands of men and women of various ages and competition levels during multi-directional sport. Wearable technology can provide similar variables during rehabilitation, home exercise programs, and during on-field transition back to sport to ensure patients have met the expected fitness capacity of their sport. Additionally, clinicians can use internal load measures to objectively monitor patient's physiological responses to rehabilitation progressions and recovery rather than relying on subjective patient-reported data.5.","This paper discusses the importance of monitoring both internal and external training loads during the rehabilitation process after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLr) to optimize recovery and inform return-to-sport decisions. It highlights the utilization of wearable technology to objectively assess movement quality and readiness, suggesting that quantifying training loads can help guide exercise prescriptions and reduce the risk of re-injury."
A Quantifiable Risk Factor for ACL Injury: Applied Mathematics to Model the Posterolateral Tibial Plateau Surface Geometry,2021-04-01,,,,"The mechanism for traumatic ruptures of the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is frequently a noncontact injury involving a valgus moment with internal rotation of the tibia. The abnormal rotation and translation of the lateral femoral condyle posteroinferiorly relative to the lateral tibial plateau is thought to be related to the geometry of the tibial plateau.The purpose of the study was to mathematically model the posterior tibial plateau geometry in patients with ACL injuries and compare it with that of matched controls. The hypothesis was that increased convexity and steepness of the posterior aspect of the lateral plateau would subject knees to higher forces, leading to a potentially higher risk of ACL injury.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.We mathematically modeled the posterior curvature of the lateral tibial plateau in 64 patients with ACL injuries and 68 matched controls. Using sagittal magnetic resonance imaging scans of the knee, points on the articular cartilage of the posterolateral tibial plateau were selected and curve-fitted to a power function (y = a × xn ). For coefficient a and coefficient n, both variables modulated the shape of the curve, where a larger magnitude represented an increase in slope steepness. Groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney test and α < .05.There was a significant difference in surface geometry between the patients with ACL injuries and matched controls. The equation coefficients were significantly larger in the patients with ACL injuries: coefficient a (ACL injury, 0.9 vs control, 0.68; P < .0001) and coefficient n (ACL injury, 0.34 vs control, 0.30; P = .07). For coefficient a, there was a 78.9% sensitivity, 77.5% specificity, and odds ratio of 12.6 (95% CI, 5.5-29.0) for ACL injury using a cutoff coefficient a = .78.Patients with ACL injuries had a significantly greater posterolateral plateau slope. The steeper drop off may play a role in higher anterior translation forces, coupled with internal rotation torques on the knee in noncontact injury, which could increase ACL strain and predispose to ACL injury.","This study mathematically models the posterior tibial plateau geometry in patients with ACL injuries compared to matched controls, aiming to identify a quantifiable risk factor for ACL injuries. The findings reveal that patients with ACL injuries exhibit significantly greater steepness in the posterolateral plateau slope, potentially contributing to higher forces that predispose these individuals to noncontact ACL injuries."
Comparison Between Soccer and Basketball of Bone Bruise and Meniscal Injury Patterns in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries,2021-04-01,,,,"The varying effectiveness of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programs between soccer and basketball may be due to differences in sport-specific injury mechanisms. Bone bruise patterns may provide information regarding injury mechanisms.To compare bone bruise and meniscal injury patterns for ACL injuries sustained in soccer versus basketball.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.Clinical notes, operative reports, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed for patients who sustained a noncontact ACL rupture while playing soccer or basketball between August 2016 and August 2018. The presence, location, and signal intensity of bone bruises on the tibia and femur were documented, and patterns were classified according to the location of the bone bruise in the lateral-medial direction. The meniscal and bone bruise injury patterns and the specific bone bruise locations were compared between the soccer and basketball groups.Overall, 138 patients were included (56 with soccer-related and 82 with basketball-related ACL injury). No significant difference between the groups was observed in bone bruise patterns (P = .743) or meniscal injury patterns (P = .952). Bone bruise on the lateral side only of both the femur and the tibia was the most common pattern in both soccer (41.9%) and basketball (47.0%) groups; the most common meniscal injury type was an isolated lateral meniscal injury in both soccer (50.0%) and basketball (45.0%) groups. For patients with bone bruises on both the lateral and the medial sides of both the femur and the tibia (BF+BT), the bone bruise signal intensity on the lateral side of the femur (P < .001) and tibia (P = .009) was significantly higher than that on the medial side for both groups. The bone bruises on the lateral side of the femur (P < .001) and tibia (P = .002) were significantly more anterior than those on the medial side for patients with the BF+BT pattern.No significant differences in bone bruise location or meniscal injury type were detected when comparing ACL injuries sustained during soccer versus basketball. The study results suggest a similar biomechanical loading pattern for ACL injuries in these sports.","This paper investigates the injury patterns associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in soccer and basketball, comparing bone bruise and meniscal injury occurrences. It finds no significant differences in the patterns or locations of bone bruises and meniscal injuries between the two sports, suggesting that ACL injuries in soccer and basketball may involve similar biomechanical loading patterns."
"The application of human factors and ergonomics (HFE) to community-sport organisations in resource scarce contexts : a case study of grassroots football in Makana, Eastern Cape",2021-04-01,,,,"Background: Modern Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) focuses on the optimisation of complex socio-technical systems and has been challenged to contribute to broader societal issues. An example is within grassroots football organisations in resource-scarce areas such as Makana, South Africa. Through embedded participatory approaches, the research problem was co-constructed: To investigate the socio-technical system of the Makana Local Football Association (LFA). Method: A useful complex system modelling tool is that of Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), with its 5 phases used to identify constraints and affordances. Three perspectives were adopted for the application of an adapted (to suit participant characteristics) CWA to the Makana LFA: 1) how work is prescribed by the governing body SAFA, 2) how subject matter experts (SME) disclose its current functioning, and 3) how SMEs imagine it could function. Five SMEs attended 12 three-hour workshops to complete the latter two perspectives. Results: The composite work domain analysis between work as prescribed and work as disclosed identified significant mismatches between how policymakers envision the system and how SMEs report its functioning. Key differences in perspectives included the fundamental purpose of the Makana LFA, while only four of 22 functions operate within the Makana LFA. Participants also identified key affordances for the LFA such as reorientation as a community sports organisation. Discussion: Comparison between perspectives indicated four mismatches. 1) SAFA views the LFA as the foundation of the talent identification and development infrastructure of South African football. SMEs view it as a community centred organisation. 2) A lack of human capacity is evident at the community level of Makana football. 3) Funding and assets are absent at this grassroots level. 4) The LFA relies on other stakeholders, but these relationships are not formalised. Policymakers, therefore, have a lack of knowledge of the contextual challenges faced by LFA administrators. It is recommended that SAFA view the LFA as a community sport organisation, focusing on improving human capacity, increasing funding, and formalising stakeholder networks. Furthermore, conceptual models from CWA provide explicit socio-technical system redesign recommendations. Conclusion: Large mismatches between the organising body SAFA and the actual functioning of the LFA significantly hinder the effective management and running of football at a grassroots level in resource-scarce contexts in South Africa. The perspectives approach to CWA was useful in elucidating the constraints and affordances of the Makana LFA socio-technical system and informing redesign opportunities. Systems HFE methodology is therefore well placed to contribute to broader societal issues within resources scarce contexts such as football in Makana. Furthermore, the philosophical underpinnings of systems based HFE were successful in the development of sustainable participatory research within the South African grassroots football context.","This paper investigates the application of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) to the socio-technical systems of grassroots football organizations in resource-scarce contexts, specifically within the Makana Local Football Association (LFA) in South Africa. Through the use of Cognitive Work Analysis, the study uncovers significant mismatches between policymakers' perceptions and the realities faced by community members, highlighting key issues such as inadequate human capacity, lack of funding, and the necessity for improved stakeholder relationships."
Muscle activity of cutting manoeuvres and soccer inside passing suggests an increased groin injury risk during these movements,2021-03-31,,,,"Abstract Cutting manoeuvres and inside passing are thought to increase the risk of sustaining groin injuries. But both movements have received little research attention in this regard. The purpose of this study was to investigate the muscle activity of adductor longus and gracilis as well as hip and knee joint kinematics during $$90^{\circ }$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msup> <mml:mn>90</mml:mn> <mml:mo>∘</mml:mo> </mml:msup> </mml:math> -cutting and inside passing. Thirteen male soccer players were investigated with 3D-motion capturing and surface electromyography of adductor longus and gracilis while performing the two movements. Hip and knee joint kinematics were calculated with AnyBody Modelling System. Muscle activity of both muscles was significantly higher during the cutting manoeuvre compared to inside passing. Kinematics showed that the highest activity occurred during phases of fast muscle lengthening and eccentric contraction of the adductors which is known to increase the groin injury risk. Of both movements, cutting showed the higher activity and is therefore more likely to cause groin injuries. However, passing might also increase the risk for groin injuries as it is one of the most performed actions in soccer, and therefore most likely causes groin injuries through overuse. Practitioners need to be aware of these risks and should prepare players accordingly through strength and flexibility training.","This study investigates muscle activity and joint kinematics during cutting manoeuvres and inside passing in soccer, focusing on potential groin injury risks. The findings indicate that cutting manoeuvres significantly increase muscle activity in the adductors, which may heighten injury risk, whereas inside passing also poses a risk due to its frequency in the sport, emphasizing the need for strength and flexibility training for players."
Analyses of Countermovement Jump Performance in Time and Frequency Domains,2021-03-31,,,,"This study aimed to analyze counter-movement jump (CMJ) performance in time and frequency domains. Fortyfour Division I American football players participated in the study. Kinetic variables were collected from both dominant and non-dominant legs using two force plates. Normalized peak power, normalized net impulse, and normalized peak force significantly correlated with jump height (r = .960, r = .998, r = .725, respectively with p &lt; .05). The mean frequency component was significantly correlated with CMJ performance (r = .355 with p &lt; .05). The reliability of the frequency variables was higher than the time domain variables. Frequency domain variables showed weaker correlations with jump height compared with time domain variables. Frequency domain analysis provides frequency components, which represent the rate of energy transmission from the eccentric phase to the end of the push-off phase. Frequency component information may provide additional information for the analyses of CMJ performance for athletes.","This study examines counter-movement jump (CMJ) performance in both time and frequency domains among Division I American football players. Key findings indicate significant correlations between kinetic variables and jump height, with a higher reliability observed in frequency domain variables, suggesting potential for enhanced analysis of CMJ performance through frequency components."
Applying the Input-Process-Outcome Model to Team Learning in Sport Sciences: An Exploratory Qualitative Study on Twenty Soccer Players,2021-03-31,,,,"In sport science literature, referring to the Input-Process-Outcome (IPO) model, few studies demonstrated links between team training and team learning despites several calls for empirical studies. Thus, this study aimed at exploring systemically the building process of the interpersonal coordination by focusing on (1) a specific antecedent (i.e., video feedback during practice), (2) the influence of this antecedent on the team learning process, and (3) outcomes from this process as shared cognitive contents. Thus, this study was original by examining empirically the IPO model in a sport-training context. Our study showed that Input influenced the specific learning Process during practice (five processes) and video feedback sessions (five processes) and produced Outcomes (six typical shared cognitive contents). Finally, results are discussed in relation to team learning processes theoretically identified in the literature and an IPO soccer model adapted to team learning in a soccer context is proposed.","This paper explores the application of the Input-Process-Outcome (IPO) model in the context of team learning among soccer players, focusing on the role of video feedback in enhancing interpersonal coordination.

Between-limb differences during 180° turns in female soccer players: application of statistical parametric mapping. J Strength Cond Res 36(11): 3136-3142, 2022-This study was exploratory in nature and investigated the ability of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to assess between-limb differences in lower-extremity movement change of direction. Fourteen female soccer players (mean ± SD ; age = 20.6 ± 0.6 years; height = 1.65 ± 0.07 m; and body mass = 56.04 ± 6.20 kg). For comparisons between preferred and nonpreferred limbs, vertical (Fz) and horizontal (Fx) ground reaction force were determined along with hip, knee, and ankle angles and moments in the sagittal plane during weight acceptance during the final contact. In addition, frontal plane knee abduction angles and moments were calculated during the final contact. Statistical parametric mapping software was then used to assess for differences between the entire weight acceptance phase of preferred and nonpreferred limbs. There were no differences between limbs in all variables using SPM. These results demonstrate that female soccer players exhibit little side-to-side differences in certain lower-limb biomechanics when performing a turn maneuver. These findings can be utilized by practitioners and clinicians when developing injury prevention and rehabilitation programs.","This study investigates between-limb differences in lower-extremity movement during 180° turns in female soccer players using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The findings reveal minimal side-to-side differences in biomechanics, highlighting potential implications for injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies."
Knee joint unloading and daily physical activity associate with cartilage T2 relaxation times 1 month after ACL injury,2021-03-29,,,,"Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is prevalent after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, but mechanismsunderlying its development are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine if gait biomechanics and daily physical activity (PA) associate with cartilage T2 relaxation times, a marker of collagen organization and water content, 1 month after ACL injury. Twenty‐seven participants (15–35 years old) without chondral lesions completed magnetic resonance imaging, three‐dimensional gait analysis, and 1 week of PA accelerometry. Interlimb differences and ratios were calculated for gait biomechanics and T2 relaxation times, respectively. Multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and concomitant meniscus injury were used to determine the association between gait biomechanics and PA with T2 relaxation times, respectively. Altered knee adduction moment (KAM) impulse, less knee flexion excursion (kEXC) and higher daily step counts accounted for 35.8%–65.8% of T2 relaxation time variation in the weightbearing and posterior cartilage of the medial and lateral compartment (all p ≤ .011). KAM impulse was the strongest factor for T2 relaxation times in all models (all p ≤ .001). Lower KAM impulse associated with longer T2 relaxation times in the injured medial compartment ( β = −.720 to −.901) and shorter T2 relaxation in the lateral compartment ( β = .713 to .956). At 1 month after ACL injury, altered KAM impulse, less kEXC, and higher PA associated with longer T2 relaxation times, which may indicate poorer cartilage health. Statement of Clinical Significance: Gait biomechanics and daily PA are modifiable targets that may improve cartilage health acutely after ACL injury and slow progression to OA.","This study investigates the relationship between gait biomechanics, daily physical activity, and cartilage health as indicated by T2 relaxation times in individuals one month post-ACL injury. Key findings suggest that altered knee adduction moment and daily step counts significantly correlate with changes in cartilage quality, highlighting modifiable factors that could potentially enhance cartilage health and mitigate the risk of osteoarthritis."
Quantifying technical actions in professional soccer using foot-mounted inertial measurement units,2021-03-29,,,,"This study aimed to (i) establish the concurrent validity and intra-unit reliability of a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit for monitoring soccer technical actions, (ii) quantify the within-microcycle inter-positional differences in the technical actions of professional soccer training, and (iii) determine the influence of drill category on the technical actions of professional soccer training.Twenty-one professional soccer players' technical performance data (ball touches, releases, ball touches per minute, releases per minute), collected during training sessions throughout twenty-four weekly microcycles, were analysed using general linear modelling.The inertial measurement unit exhibited good concurrent validity (PA = 95.1% - 100.0%) and intra-unit reliability (PA = 95.9% - 96.9%, CV = 1.4% - 2.9%) when compared with retrospective video analyses. The most ball touches (X‾ = 218.0) and releases (X‾ = 110.8) were observed on MD - 1, with MD - 5 eliciting the highest frequency of ball touches (X‾ = 3.8) and releases (X‾ = 1.7) per minute. Central midfielders performed the most ball touches (X‾ = 221.9), releases (X‾ = 108.3), ball touches per minute (X‾ = 3.4) and releases per minute (X‾ = 1.6). Small-sided games evoked more ball touches (X‾diff = 1.5) and releases per minute (X‾diff = 0.1) than previously reported in match-play. The fewest ball touches (X‾ = 1.2) and releases per minute (X‾ = 0.5) were observed during tactical drills.The results of this study provide a novel understanding of the within-microcycle, inter-positional and drill category differences in the technical actions performed by professional players during training.","This study investigates the use of foot-mounted inertial measurement units to monitor technical actions in professional soccer, focusing on their validity and reliability. Key findings include significant inter-positional differences in ball touches and releases during different training drills, with central midfielders demonstrating the highest technical activity levels."

Haptic Glove TV Device for People with Visual Impairment,2021-03-26,,,,"Immersive video is changing the way we enjoy TV. It is no longer just about receiving sequential images with audio, but also playing with other human senses through smells, vibrations of movement, 3D audio, feeling water, wind, heat, and other emotions that can be experienced through all human senses. This work aims to validate the usefulness of an immersive and interactive solution for people with severe visual impairment by developing a haptic glove that allows receiving signals and generating vibrations in hand, informing about what happens in a scene. The study case presented here shows how the haptic device can take the information about the ball’s location in the playing field, synchronized with the video reception, and deliver it to the user in the form of vibrations during the re-transmission of a soccer match. In this way, we take visually impaired people to live a new sensory experience, allowing digital and social inclusion and accessibility to audiovisual technologies that they could not enjoy before. This work shows the methodology used for the design, implementation, and results evaluation. Usability tests were carried out with fifteen visually impaired people who used the haptic device to attend a soccer match synchronized with the glove’s vibrations.","This paper explores the development of a haptic glove designed for individuals with severe visual impairments, enabling them to experience soccer matches through vibrations that correspond to the ball's location on the field.

The Effect Of Load On The Kinetics And Kinematics Of The Lower Extremity During Landing,2021-03-25,,,,"Purpose: To understand the differences in the lower extremity kinetics and kinematics as load increases during jump landings. Methods: Ten male participants (20.4 years ± 2.41 years, 108.8kg ± 14.02kg) took part in two testing sessions. The first testing session involved testing each participant’s 1-repetition max in the hexagonal barbell deadlift. The second testing session involved the data collection of the jumping trials for each participant. Participants performed their countermovement jumps under seven randomized conditions. Six of the conditions involved the hex bar using loads equivalent to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% estimated 1-repetition max of the hexagonal barbell deadlift. The seventh condition was an unloaded (bodyweight or 0%) countermovement jump. Peak values for joint powers, moments, angles, and velocities were recorded for the ankle, knee, and hip for all participants and conditions. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences among results. Results: Significant differences (p < .05) were found in the joint powers and moments but no differences were found in any condition or joint for the peak angles or velocities. The greatest absolute values for both the peak powers and moments were found at the unloaded condition and decreased as load increased. Conclusion: This investigation has largely supported the previous research that has been done regarding loaded landings. The current findings support the previous notions that jump heights and joint velocity seem to have direct effect on joint moments and powers. Implications for injury risk and sports performance can also be drawn from these results, but more research would need to be done in order to fully understand loaded landings as they relate to either of those topics. Additionally, as the landscape of loaded landings is still quite shallow, any research regarding the effects to the lower extremity at landing with load would continue to create a more robust understanding of such an important aspect of jumping.","This paper investigates how increasing loads during jump landings affect the kinetics and kinematics of the lower extremities. The results indicate significant differences in joint powers and moments with unloaded landings producing higher peak values, suggesting implications for injury risk and athletic performance, while highlighting the need for further research in this area."
Seasonal training and match load and micro-cycle periodization in male Premier League academy soccer players,2021-03-24,,,,"We quantified on pitch external loading of English Premier League (EPL) academy soccer players (n=76; U12-U18 age groups) over an entire competitive season. Mean accumulative weekly duration and total distance, respectively, was similar in the U12 (329±29 min; 19.9±2.2 km), U13 (323±29 min; 20.0±2.0 km) and U14 (339±25 min; 21.7±2.0 km; P>0.05 for all comparisons) age-groups, though all teams were less than U15 (421±15 min; 26.2±2.1 km), U16 (427±20 min; 25.9±2.5 km) and U18 (398±30 min; 26.1±2.6 km) players (P<0.05 for all comparisons). Mean weekly high-speed running and sprint distance was not different between U12 (220±95 m and 6±9 m respectively), U13 (331±212 m and 6±27 m) and U14 (448±193 m and 21±29 m) age-groups (P>0.05 for all pairwise comparisons) though all squads were less than U15 (657±242 m and 49±98 m), U16 (749±152 m and 95±55 m) and U18 (979±254 m and 123±56 m) age-groups (P<0.05 for all pairwise comparisons). Data demonstrate that absolute weekly training volume in EPL academy soccer players increases throughout the academy pathway. Furthermore, although U16-U18 players are capable of achieving similar training and match volumes as previously reported in adult EPL players, they do not yet achieve the absolute intensities of adult EPL players.","The paper investigates the external training loads of English Premier League academy soccer players across various age groups over a full competitive season. It highlights that while younger players (U12-U14) have lower mean weekly training volumes compared to older players (U15-U18), all academy players show an increase in training volume as they progress through the academy."
"Alternative upper configurations during agility-based movements: part 2, joint-level biomechanics",2021-03-22,,,,"Alternative shoe fit configurations can improve agility performance, however the joint level biomechanical changes that contribute to enhanced performance are unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in joint-level biomechanics related to jumping and cutting performance and potential injury risk mechanisms, between different shoe upper configurations. NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes (n = 31) recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four agility-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump Repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump Repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step Drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior Drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Panel. Ankle, knee and hip range of motion and peak joint moments in the sagittal, frontal and transverse planes, as well as peak joint powers, were calculated for CMJ and LSJ movements. Alternative fit configurations led to increased ankle plantarflexion and knee extension joint moments. Further, frontal and transverse plane ranges of motion at the ankle, knee and hip were reduced with at least one alternative fit configuration. These findings help to explain improved agility performance with upper configurations designed to better fit the shape of the foot and suggest improved lower limb alignment which may help to prevent musculoskeletal injury.","This study investigates the impact of different shoe upper configurations on joint-level biomechanics during agility-based movements, specifically focusing on their effects on jumping and cutting performance.

Biomechanical Characteristics between Bionic Shoes and Normal Shoes during the Drop-Landing Phase: A Pilot Study,2021-03-20,,,,"With the development of unstable footwear, more research has focused on the advantages of this type of shoe. This type of shoe could improve the muscle function of the lower limb and prevent injury risks in dynamic situations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate differences in lower-limb kinetics and kinematics based on single-leg landing (SLL) using normal shoes (NS) and bionic shoes (BS). The study used 15 male subject volunteers (age 23.4 ± 1.14 years, height 177.6 ± 4.83cm, body weight (BW) 73.6 ± 7.02 kg). To ensure the subject standardization of the participants, there were several inclusion criteria used for selection. There were two kinds of experimental shoes used in the landing experiment to detect the change of lower limbs when a landing task was performed. Kinetics and kinematic data were collected during an SLL task, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was used to evaluate the differences between NS and BS. We found that the flexion and extension angles of the knee (p = 0.004) and hip (p = 0.046, p = 0.018) joints, and the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of ankle (p = 0.031) moment were significantly different in the sagittal planes. In the frontal plane, the eversion and inversion of the ankle (p = 0.016), and the abduction and adduction of knee (p = 0.017, p = 0.007) angle were found significant differences. In the horizontal plane, the external and internal rotation of hip (p = 0.036) and knee (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.029) moment were found significant differences, and knee angle (p = 0.043) also. According to our results, we conclude that using BS can cause bigger knee and hip flexion than NS. Also, this finding indicates that BS might be considered to reduce lower-limb injury risk during the SLL phase.","The paper investigates the differences in lower-limb kinetics and kinematics during a single-leg landing task using bionic shoes compared to normal shoes. Key findings indicate that bionic shoes lead to significant changes in knee and hip flexion angles, as well as ankle moments, suggesting their potential to reduce lower-limb injury risks."
The effect of the combination of whole body vibration and shoe with an unstable surface in chronic ankle instability treatment: a randomized clinical trial,2021-03-19,,,,"Abstract Background Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a common condition following an ankle sprain. This study investigated the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) and shoe with an unstable surface training on balance, functional performance, strength, joint position sense in people with CAI. Method Thirty- four peoples with unilateral CAI were randomly assigned to three groups: WBV group, WBV with shoe with an unstable surface (WBV-S), and no treatment control group (CON). The WBV group received 4 weeks progressive WBV training and the WBV-S group received progressive WBV training with shoe with an unstable surface. Modified star excursion balance test (mSEBT)reach distance, Hop-Test, muscle strength, and joint position sense were measured at baseline and after the 4 weeks; Moreover, the mSEBT and Hop-Test were reassessed again 2 weeks post intervention. Results The result showed a significant group-by-time interaction for anterior and posterolateral directions of mSEBT. The reach distance of these directions at post-intervention and follow-up increased significantly compare to pre-intervention in the WBV and WBV-S groups but not significantly change in the CON group. The Hop test in the WBV-S group was significantly more at post-intervention and follow-up compared to pre-intervention. However, no significant changes were observed in WBV and CON groups. No significant changes were observed for mSEBT posteromedial direction, muscles strength, and joint position sense errors. Conclusion The 4 weeks WBV and WBV-S interventions could improve balance in peoples with CAI. Improvement in Hop test was only observed in the WBV-S group suggesting the added value of combining WBV and shoe with an unstable surface as an effective therapy compared to WBV training alone. The use of WBV and WBV-S were not associated with significant changes in strength and joint position sense variables over a four-week period. Trial registration This work registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( IRCT20151118025105N4 ).","This paper investigates the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) training and the use of shoes with an unstable surface on balance and functional performance in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). The findings indicate that both interventions improved balance significantly, with the combination of WBV and unstable surface shoes leading to greater enhancements in the Hop test compared to WBV alone, while no significant changes were observed in strength or joint position sense."
Associations Between Variations in Accumulated Workload and Physiological Variables in Young Male Soccer Players Over the Course of a Season,2021-03-18,,,,"This study sought to analyze the relationship between in-season training workload with changes in aerobic power (VO 2m ax ), maximum and resting heart rate (HR max and HR rest ), linear sprint medium (LSM), and short test (LSS), in soccer players younger than 16 years (under-16 soccer players). We additionally aimed to explain changes in fitness levels during the in-season through regression models, considering accumulated load, baseline levels, and peak height velocity (PHV) as predictors. Twenty-three male sub-elite soccer players aged 15.5 ± 0.2 years (PHV: 13.6 ± 0.4 years; body height: 172.7 ± 4.2 cm; body mass: 61.3 ± 5.6 kg; body fat: 13.7% ± 3.9%; VO 2m ax : 48.4 ± 2.6 mL⋅kg –1 ⋅min –1 ), were tested three times across the season (i.e., early-season (EaS), mid-season (MiS), and end-season (EnS) for VO 2m ax , HR max , LSM, and LSS. Aerobic and speed variables gradually improved over the season and had a strong association with PHV. Moreover, the HR max demonstrated improvements from EaS to EnS; however, this was more evident in the intermediate period (from EaS to MiS) and had a strong association with VO 2m ax . Regression analysis showed significant predictions for VO 2m ax [ F ( 2, 20) = 8.18, p ≤ 0.001] with an R 2 of 0.45. In conclusion, the meaningful variation of youth players’ fitness levels can be observed across the season, and such changes can be partially explained by the load imposed.","This paper investigates the correlation between training workload and physiological variables, such as aerobic power and heart rate, in male soccer players under 16 years old over a season. The findings demonstrate that fitness levels, including VO2 max and sprint performance, improved throughout the season and were significantly influenced by accumulated workload, baseline fitness, and the players' peak height velocity."
Mechanism of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Loading during Dynamic Motor Tasks,2021-03-16,,,,"This study determined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) force and its contributors during a standardized drop-land-lateral jump task using a validated computational model.Three-dimensional whole-body kinematics, ground reaction forces, and muscle activation patterns from eight knee-spanning muscles were collected during dynamic tasks performed by healthy recreationally active females (n = 24). These data were used in a combined neuromusculoskeletal and ACL force model to determine lower limb muscle and ACL forces.Peak ACL force (2.3 ± 0.5 bodyweight) was observed at ~14% of stance during the drop-land-lateral jump. The ACL force was primarily generated through the sagittal plane, and muscle was the dominant source of ACL loading. The main ACL antagonists (i.e., loaders) were the gastrocnemii and quadriceps, whereas the hamstrings were the main ACL agonists (i.e., supporters).Combining neuromusculoskeletal and ACL force models, the roles of muscle in ACL loading and support were determined during a challenging motor task. Results highlighted the importance of the gastrocnemius in ACL loading, which could be considered more prominently in ACL injury prevention and rehabilitation programs.","This paper investigates the forces acting on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during a drop-land-lateral jump task in healthy women, utilizing a combined neuromusculoskeletal and ACL force model.

Training load responses to football game profile-based training (GPBT) formats: effects of locomotive demands manipulation,2021-03-16,,,,"The aim of this study was to compare internal and external load profiles of different game profile-based training (GPBT) formats among elite young football players. Twenty-one participants (age: 18.7 ± 0.6 years) performed three sessions of three GPBT formats, which were matched for training volume but structured with different high-speed running and sprint demands: i) performed along linear paths (GPBT-L); ii) performed as repetitive actions of short distance including many multi-directional changes of direction (GPBT-S) and, iii) a combination of the other two protocols, that is linear high-speed runs and sprint efforts with a single change of direction (GPBT-M). External load outputs were collected using GPS units, physiological and perceptual responses were monitored with heart rate (HR) monitors, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), respectively. While no differences were found between formats for HR and RPE, distinct external load profiles were observed for high-speed running (HSD) and sprint distances (SD), (GPBT-L > GPBT-M > GBPT-S, all p < 0.05), and high-intensity acceleration and deceleration efforts (HIE), (GPBT-S > GPBT-M > GPBT-L, all p < 0.05). Moreover, the GPBT-S format was characterized by greater intra-session variability for HSD, SD, and HIE (CV% = 24.2%, 16.5% and 20.4%, respectively) and inter-session variability for HSD and SD (CV% = 10% and 15.7%, respectively) compared to the other two formats. Considering their load profiles and the associated reliability scores, football practitioners can implement GPBT formats interchangeably to elicit necessary internal load responses and selectively to prioritize specific external load outputs.","This study investigates the internal and external load profiles of various game profile-based training (GPBT) formats among elite young football players, focusing on the manipulation of locomotive demands. The findings reveal distinct external load profiles for different training formats, indicating that practitioners can interchange GPBT formats to achieve targeted internal load responses and prioritize specific external load outputs."

Recovery following the extra-time period of soccer: practitioner perspectives and applied practices,2021-03-16,,,,"Research has demonstrated that the extra-time (ET) period of soccer negatively impacts recovery. However, it is not known to what extent recovery practices are being adapted by practitioners following ET and where gaps exist between research and practice. Therefore, this study explored soccer practitioner perceptions of recovery practices following ET matches. A total of 72 practitioners from across different levels of soccer and several countries completed a bespoke online survey. Inductive content analysis of the responses identified five higher-order themes: 'conditioning', 'player monitoring', 'recovery practices', 'training', and 'future research directions'. Mixed responses were received in relation to whether practitioners condition players in preparation for ET, though 72% allowed players to return to training based on fatigue markers following this additional 30-min period. Sixty-three (88%) practitioners believed that ET delays the time-course of recovery, with 82% highlighting that practices should be adapted following ET compared with a typical 90-min match. Forty-nine practitioners (68%) reduce training loads and intensities for up to 48 hr post ET matches, though training mostly recommences as 'normal' at 72 hr. Sixty-three (88%) practitioners believed that more research should be conducted on recovery following ET, with 'tracking players physiological and physical responses', 'nutritional interventions to accelerate recovery' and 'changes in acute injury-risk' being the three areas of research that practitioners ranked as most important. These data suggest practitioners and coaches adjust recovery practices following ET matches compared to 90 min. Further research on the efficacy of recovery strategies following ET matches is required to inform applied practice.","The paper investigates how soccer practitioners adapt recovery practices following extra-time matches, highlighting the perceived impact of extra-time on recovery and the need for tailored recovery strategies. It identifies five themes from practitioner responses, including conditioning, player monitoring, and the necessity for further research on recovery methodologies post-extra-time."
Effects of contemporary cryo-compression on post-training performance in elite academy footballers,2021-03-16,,,,"Fatigue is a predisposing risk factor for injury commonly investigated in elite football populations. Little evidence advocates the most beneficial recovery strategies including contemporary cooling applications. The aim of the study was to examine immediate effects of the Game Ready® on physiological and biomechanical measures in a population of elite male academy footballers, following a fatiguing training session mid-competitive season. Twenty, elite male footballers took part (180.2 ± 8.7cm, 75.0 ± 11.4kg, 18 ± 0.5years). Following a normal fatiguing training session, players were randomly assigned to receive either cryotherapy (Game Ready®) (20-minutes at medium compression (5-55 mm Hg)) or passive recovery (PAS). Data was collected at match-day+1, immediately post-training and immediately post-intervention. Performance measures included countermovement jump (CMJ), isometric adductor strength (IAS), hamstring flexibility (HF), and skin surface temperature (Tsk). Significant main effects for group for CMJ data following exposure to cooling were displayed (p = < 0.05). Individual group analysis displayed a significant reduction in CMJ performance in the group exposed to cryotherapy (p = < 0.05) immediately post, but not for PAS. No main effects were identified for cryotherapy or PAS group for IAS or HF (p = > 0.05). Tsk reduced significantly (p = < 0.05) in the cryotherapy group, meeting therapeutic Tsk range. Reductions in performance immediately following exposure to pneumatic cryo-compressive devices may negate the justification of this recovery strategy if neuromuscular mechanisms are required in immediate short term. Application of such recovery strategies however are dependent on the type of recovery demand and should be adapted individually to suit the needs of the athlete to optimise readiness to train/play.","The paper investigates the effects of contemporary cryo-compression on post-training performance in elite academy footballers, particularly focusing on recovery from fatigue-related performance decline. Findings indicate that while cryotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in countermovement jump performance immediately after treatment, it did not show the same effects on isometric adductor strength or hamstring flexibility, suggesting that individualized recovery strategies are necessary to optimize athletic readiness."
Post-activation performance enhancement strategies in sport: a brief review for practitioners,2021-03-12,,,,"In this review, we will present and critically discuss how different conditioning exercises can be implemented in training, testing, and competition for the enhancement of performances in different sports, via post-activation performance enhancement and other delayed potentiation responses. The potentiation approaches described here include warming up, testing and monitoring, re-warm-up and priming strategies, and complex training. The post-activation performance enhancement responses can be best described following the new taxonomy, which allows the identification of the best strategies in every specific sport setting. This requires identifying the post-activation performance enhancement factors, which are the conditioning activity, the verification test, the population of athletes; and potential moderators (i.e. exercise type and loading, timing; recovery interval, target exercise, performance parameter; training background, age, and sex). The inherent limitations to these approaches, including the gaps in literature requiring further studies, may be overcome in practice by using individualized approaches.","This paper reviews various conditioning exercises aimed at enhancing athletic performance through post-activation performance enhancement strategies. It discusses different approaches like warming up and complex training, while emphasizing the importance of individualized strategies and addressing the existing gaps in literature on this topic."
Anterior cruciate ligament injury: towards a gendered environmental approach,2021-03-10,,,,"Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rate for girls/women has not changed in over 20 years, and they remain 3–6 times more likely to experience injury compared with boys/men. To date, ACL injury prevention and management has been approached from a sex-based biological point of view which has furthered our understanding of injury risk factors, mechanisms, and prevention and rehabilitation programmes. However, the traditional sex-based approach does not take into account the growing recognition of how sex and gender (a social construct) are ‘entangled’ and influence each other. Objective This paper discusses the curious absence of gender as an influencer in the dialogue surrounding ACL injuries. We propose adding gender as a pervasive developmental environment as a new theoretical overlay to an established injury model to illustrate how gender can operate as an extrinsic determinant from the presport, training and competition environments through to ACL injury and the treatment environment. Approach We draw on social epidemiological theories of the embodiment of gender and health to provide plausible examples of how gender may influence ACL injury, and demonstrate the opportunity for new, interdisciplinary research in the field. Conclusion Over 20 years of research has failed to decrease the ACL injury rate disparity between girls/women and boys/men. Embedding gender in the study of ACL injury will heighten awareness of possible influences outside the traditional biological elements, challenge us to think about the inextricable ‘entanglement’ of sex and gender, and inform more effective approaches to ACL injury prevention and treatment.","This paper examines the persistent disparity in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rates between genders, highlighting that girls and women are significantly more likely to suffer these injuries compared to boys and men. It advocates for a gendered environmental approach to ACL injury research, emphasizing the need to consider social constructs of gender alongside biological factors, and suggests that integrating this perspective can lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies."
Is there meaningful influence from situational and environmental factors on the physical and technical activity of elite football players? Evidence from the data of 5 consecutive seasons of the German Bundesliga,2021-03-09,,,,"The study aimed to identify the effects of situational (match location, match outcome and strength of team/opponent team) and environmental (ambient temperature, relative humidity, WBGT, ground and weather condition) factors on the physical and technical activity of elite football on individual playing positions. Physical and technical activity were collected from 779 football players competing in the German Bundesliga during 5 domestic seasons, from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019, totalling 1530 matches. The data on players' physical and technical activity was taken from the IMPIRE AG system. Based on the available data, 11 variables were selected to quantify the match activity profiles of players. The results showed that situational variables had major effects on the technical performance (especially number of passes performed) but minor effects on physical performance. In turn, among the analysed environmental factors, temperature is the most sensitive, which affects the Total Distance and Sprint Efforts of players in all five positions. This investigation demonstrated that, given that passing is a key technical activity in modern football, players and training staff should be particularly aware that passing maybe affected by situational variables. Professional players are able to react and adapt to various environmental conditions, modifying physical activity depending on the needs in German Bundesliga. These results could help coaches and analysts to better understand the influences of situational and environmental variables on individual playing positions during the evaluation of players' physical and technical performance.","The paper investigates the influence of situational and environmental factors on the physical and technical activity of elite football players in the German Bundesliga over five seasons. It highlights that while situational factors significantly impact technical performance, particularly the number of passes, environmental conditions such as temperature primarily affect players' Total Distance and Sprint Efforts across all positions, emphasizing the need for coaches to consider these variables in player evaluations."
Three-dimensional data-tracking simulations of sprinting using a direct collocation optimal control approach,2021-03-08,,,,"Biomechanical simulation and modelling approaches have the possibility to make a meaningful impact within applied sports settings, such as sprinting. However, for this to be realised, such approaches must first undergo a thorough quantitative evaluation against experimental data. We developed a musculoskeletal modelling and simulation framework for sprinting, with the objective to evaluate its ability to reproduce experimental kinematics and kinetics data for different sprinting phases. This was achieved by performing a series of data-tracking calibration (individual and simultaneous) and validation simulations, that also featured the generation of dynamically consistent simulated outputs and the determination of foot-ground contact model parameters. The simulated values from the calibration simulations were found to be in close agreement with the corresponding experimental data, particularly for the kinematics (average root mean squared differences (RMSDs) less than 1.0° and 0.2 cm for the rotational and translational kinematics, respectively) and ground reaction force (highest average percentage RMSD of 8.1%). Minimal differences in tracking performance were observed when concurrently determining the foot-ground contact model parameters from each of the individual or simultaneous calibration simulations. The validation simulation yielded results that were comparable (RMSDs less than 1.0° and 0.3 cm for the rotational and translational kinematics, respectively) to those obtained from the calibration simulations. This study demonstrated the suitability of the proposed framework for performing future predictive simulations of sprinting, and gives confidence in its use to assess the cause-effect relationships of technique modification in relation to performance. Furthermore, this is the first study to provide dynamically consistent three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations of sprinting across different phases.","This paper presents a framework for three-dimensional musculoskeletal modeling and simulation of sprinting, aiming to evaluate its accuracy in reproducing experimental data related to kinematics and kinetics. The study demonstrates successful calibration and validation of the model with minimal differences in performance, indicating its potential for future predictive simulations and analysis of technique modifications in sprinting."
Analyzing ACL Injury Risk Using 3D-Motion Sensors and Various Statistical Methods,2021-03-07,,,,"This paper will focus on studying the biomechanics related to the ACL injury through 3D-motion sensors.A specially designed countermovement force test was conducted before and after a 2-hour exercise window to fatigue the muscles associated with the ACL injury.7 sensors were placed on the body to derive the 3D-motion biomechanics.The fatigue factor associated with ACL injury risk was particularly addressed through the contact forces and the joint flexion profiles during both the jumping and landing periods.When the body muscles are fatigued, the knee cannot be held as steadily and provide enough knee cushion during the soft toes' landing period.This period is crucial to protecting the ACL in the hard landing that immediately follows.The Multivariate Correlation was implemented to choose the most important variables that reflected ACL injury risk from the 20 total joint angles collected.Modern Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based Multivariate SPC (Statistical Process Control) chart techniques were utilized to discover the comprehensive 3D-motion insights which then helped explain the bio-mechanisms associated with ACL injury risk.","This paper investigates the biomechanics of ACL injury risk using 3D-motion sensors to analyze joint flexion profiles and contact forces during jumping and landing phases. By employing advanced statistical methods like Multivariate Correlation and PCA-based SPC, the study aims to identify critical variables affecting ACL injury risk, particularly in relation to muscle fatigue."
The Influence of Asymptomatic Hypermobility on Unanticipated Cutting Biomechanics,2021-03-06,,,,"Generalized joint hypermobility is an important risk factor for knee injuries, including to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Examining movement patterns specific to hypermobile individuals during sport-specific movements could facilitate development of targeted recommendations and injury prevention programs for this population.Asymptomatic hypermobile participants will present kinematics measures suggestive of a greater risk of noncontact knee or ACL injuries.Cross-sectional study.Level 3.Forty-two (15 asymptomatic hypermobile and 27 nonhypermobile) individuals performed unanticipated side-step cutting on their dominant and nondominant legs. Ankle, knee, hip, pelvis, and trunk angles in all planes of motion were collected during the first 100 ms after initial contact using a 3-dimensional infrared system. Precontact foot-ground angles were also extracted. Data from hypermobile and nonhypermobile groups were compared using multiple regression models with sex as a confounder. When nonsignificant, the confounder was removed from the model. Effect sizes (Hedge g) were calculated in the presence of significant between-group differences.Hypermobile individuals presented with lower minimum knee valgus angles with a mean difference of 3.5° (P = 0.03, Hedge g = 0.69) and greater peak knee external rotation angles with a mean difference of -4.5° (P = 0.04, Hedge g = 0.70) during dominant leg cutting, and lower peak ankle plantarflexion angles with a mean difference of 4.5° (P = 0.03, Hedge g = 0.73) during nondominant leg cutting compared with nonhypermobile individuals.Based on current scientific evidence, however, the identified differences are not crucial biomechanical injury risk factors that could predispose asymptomatic hypermobile individuals to noncontact knee or ACL injuries.Further research is needed to highlight differences between hypermobility groups. Knowledge of the differences between these groups may change the physical activity recommendations, prevention of injury, and rehabilitation approaches.","This paper investigates how generalized joint hypermobility affects biomechanics during unanticipated cutting movements, focusing on knee injury risks related to asymptomatic individuals. It identifies significant differences in kinematic measures between hypermobile and nonhypermobile participants, suggesting that while certain movement patterns are observable, they may not represent crucial injury risk factors for noncontact knee or ACL injuries."
Marker location and knee joint constraint affect the reporting of overhead squat kinematics in elite youth football players,2021-03-05,,,,"Motion capture systems are used in the analysis and interpretation of athlete movement patterns for a variety of reasons, but data integrity remains critical regardless. The extent to which marker location or constraining degrees of freedom (DOF) in the biomechanical model impacts on this integrity lacks consensus. Ten elite academy footballers performed bilateral overhead squats using a marker-based motion capture system. Kinematic data were calculated using four different marker sets with 3DOF and 6DOF configurations for the three joint rotations of the right knee. Root mean squared error differences between marker sets ranged in the sagittal plane between 1.02 and 4.19 degrees to larger values in the frontal (1.30-6.39 degrees) and transverse planes (1.33 and 7.97 degrees). The cross-correlation function of the knee kinematic time series for all eight marker-sets ranged from excellent for sagittal plane motion (>0.99) but reduced for both coronal and transverse planes (<0.9). Two-way ANOVA repeated measures calculated at peak knee flexion revealed significant differences between marker sets for frontal and transverse planes (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between some marker sets. Marker location and constraining DOF while measuring relatively large ranges of motion in this population are important considerations for data integrity.","The paper investigates the impact of marker location and degrees of freedom (DOF) constraints on the kinematic analysis of overhead squats in elite youth football players using a motion capture system. It finds significant differences in knee joint kinematics based on marker configurations, highlighting the importance of proper marker placement and model constraints for ensuring data integrity in biomechanical assessments."
External and internal loads during the competitive season in professional female soccer players according to their playing position: differences between training and competition,2021-03-04,,,,"The aim of this study was to compare external (EL) and internal loads (IL) during training sessions compared to official matches between elite female soccer players according to their playing position. Training and match data were obtained during the 2017/18 season from eighteen players (age: 26.5±5.7 years; height: 164.4±5.3 cm; body mass: 58.56±5.58 kg) from a first Division Spanish team. The EL (total distance covered; high-speed running distance; number of accelerations and decelerations) was assessed with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and triaxial accelerometer. The IL was assessed with ratings of perceived exertion (RPE; and session-RPE). The EL and the IL from official matches were higher compared to training sessions (p<0.05; effect size [ES]:0.6–5.4). In matches, the EL was greater in Attackers (AT) and Central Midfielders (CM) versus Central Backs (p<0.05; ES:0.21–1.74). During training sessions, the EL was similar between playing positions (p>0.05; ES:0.03–0.87). The EL and the IL are greater in matches compared to training sessions, with greater match-related EL in AT and CM players. Current results may help practitioners to better understand and modulate training session’s loads according to playing position, potentially contributing to their performance readiness and injury risk reduction.","This study analyzes and compares external and internal loads experienced by professional female soccer players during training and competitive matches, focusing on differences based on playing position. Findings indicate that both external and internal loads are significantly higher during matches, particularly for attackers and central midfielders, which can inform training load management to enhance performance and reduce injury risk."
Isolated partial tear of extensor digitorum longus tendon with overlying muscle herniation in acute ankle sports injury: role of high resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound,2021-03-03,,,,Lateral Ankle sprain is a common sports-related trauma with the mechanism of injury ranging from inversion to plantar flexion. These injuries commonly affect the ligaments but can also affect the associated soft tissue structures like the eversion muscles and tendons. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of such injuries is warranted so as to ensure early return to play and prevent long-term complications. Lateral ankle sprain injuries in sports may not always be associated with ligament injuries. We report a never before reported case of lateral ankle sprain injury in a soccer player with the unusual finding of isolated partial tear of Extensor digitorum longus muscle and its fascia leading to myo-fascial herniation. The lateral ankle ligaments were intact. The diagnosis was clinched on a high-frequency ultrasound scan supported by dynamic maneuvers which in fact proved to be superior to MRI as the latter failed to demonstrate the myo-fascial herniation in our case. We therefore propose that real-time ultrasound scanning with dynamic maneuvers should be the first line of investigation to assess sports injuries in anatomically complex joints like the ankle.,"This paper discusses a unique case of an isolated partial tear of the extensor digitorum longus tendon with accompanying muscle herniation following a lateral ankle sprain in a soccer player. It highlights the superiority of high-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound over MRI for diagnosing such soft tissue injuries, advocating for ultrasound as the primary assessment tool for complex ankle injuries in sports."

Prevalence Of Achilles Tendinopathy and Associated Selected Intrinsic Risk Factors among Nigerian Footballers,2021-03-01,,,,"Background.Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a major foot and ankle overuse injury which has been reported to be prevalent in running and jumping sporting activities, especially football which has witnessed increased participation in recent times.However, there are no epidemiological data on tendinopathy in footballers in Nigeria.The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Achilles tendinopathy and associated intrinsic risk factors among Nigerian footballers.Methods.Participants were 151 registered football players recruited from various football clubs in Lagos State, Nigeria.Selected intrinsic factors of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), random blood glucose and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion were evaluated.AT was determined with the Royal London Hospital Test and ultrasonography.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to determine the association between AT and selected intrinsic risk factors and significance set at p < 0.05.Results.The prevalence of AT was 15.9%.There were significant associations between elevated BMI (p = 0.027), left ankle dorsiflexion (p = 0.035) and right ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.008) with Achilles tendinopathy.No significant association (p > 0.05) was found between Achilles tendinopathy and blood glucose level.Conclusions.Elevated body mass index, reduced ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion are risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy.","The paper investigates the prevalence of Achilles tendinopathy (AT) among Nigerian footballers and identifies associated intrinsic risk factors. The study found a 15.9% prevalence of AT, with significant associations linked to elevated body mass index and reduced ankle motion, specifically dorsiflexion and plantarflexion."
Relationship Between Passing and Ball Control in Soccer: Analysis of Variations of Kinematic Measures,2021-03-01,,,,"Abstract Introduction. A soccer player with good ball control is the one who is able to perform complex coordinated situational motor actions in a certain space and in as short time period as possible. The analysis included variations in the angle of the knee joint of the leg receiving a ball (AKLR), angle of the knee joint of the supporting leg (AKLS), angle between thighs (ABT), trunk bending angle (TBA), hip joint point height (HPH), and ball distance after controlling the ball (BDAC) between effective and ineffective passing in soccer. Material and Methods. A total of 12 university soccer players (age: 20.8 ± .83 years old, experience: 4.7 ±.78 years) voluntarily participated in the study. The players made five attempts to control the ball with the inside foot. The best attempt was analysed for each case (effective and ineffective). Results. The degrees of AKLR, AKLS, ABT, TBA and HPH were significantly greater in effective passing than those in ineffective passing; the observed effect sizes were 4.87, 2.53, 1.77, 3.98, and 3.40, respectively. BDAC was meaningfully greater at ineffective passing (effect size: 2.03). Conclusions. There were significant differences in the values of kinematic variables used to test ball control by effective and ineffective passes (p &lt; 0.05). The research sample, in terms of the values of kinematic variables, achieved noticeable progress during the performance of ball control for effective passing, which showed its effectiveness in reducing the distance after controlling the ball.","This paper analyzes the relationship between kinematic measures and ball control in soccer, focusing on differences between effective and ineffective passing. Key findings indicate that several kinematic variables, such as angles of the knee and trunk, significantly differ between effective and ineffective passes, highlighting the importance of specific body mechanics in enhancing ball control."
STORYTELLING IN VR: HELPING CHILDREN WITH FEAR OF THE DARK,2021-03-01,,,,"Though using virtual reality (VR) as a substitute for exposition therapy in phobia treatments has become more popular in recent times, many of these VR-based treatments require the assistance of a psychologist or a therapist. Furthermore, the majority of VR therapy is targeted at socially-based phobias or anxiety disorders. Fear of the dark is one of the most common fears in children and can develop into a diagnosed phobia in their later lives, but has yet to be prevented or treated with VR therapy programs. A measure to help children overcome their fears in a safe environment together with their care-takers could help improve familial relationships and ease the stress that this kind of phobia introduces in home life. This article presents the game design of one such VR prototype and discusses its potential as a therapeutic instrument for children with phobia of the dark.Fear of the dark is one of the most common fears in children and is thought to be a normal part of their development; however, a child’s fear of the dark can develop into a diag-nosed phobia in their later lives. 84.7% of children between 7 and 9 years of age suffer from mild nighttime fears. The fear of the dark can have a debilitating effect on a person’s life – or, if a child is affected, their caretakers’ lives also – as it inhibits leaving the house after dark, sleeping with a nightlight on, and suffering night terrors.This article will thus approach five topics: (1) the theoretical background of this study, which includes the following themes: virtual reality, gaming, and phobia; (2) related work; (3) method; and (4) functional design, being that the fifth (5) and final section of this paper concerns its conclusion.A working functional prototype was developed and consisted of a serious game adventure for a young childreen (between 7 and 9 years old). A case study was conducted to child with fear of the dark, and the results were very positive in terms of motivation, satisfaction and tolerance to exposure to dark environments presented in the game. The protoype was developed with Unity3d and deployed on Oculus Go VR head-set.The game consisted of an opne world that was divided into three differently lit areas.The first was set in daylight, the second one in a setting sun phase, and the third was set at night. The fourth and final setting of the game happend in a dark cave where there are no light sources.The world model was built with Gaia (a world-building asset for Unity3D), exported to Blender for stylization and simplification and then imported back into Unity3D, where it was then populated with free 3D assets downloaded from the Unity Asset Store (i.e. trees, grass, water, animals, and other props).The prototype’s environment shares some characteristics with open-world video games, as the player can explore each area at their own pace before deciding to advance to the next one. This aspect was included in the gameplay to allow for the player to advance without feeling pressured by other factors such as in-game time or enemies.This study shows the potential of VR as a therapeutic game for children and should be further explored. Narrative, perceptive imersion and the game environment is able to captivate a child’s attention and motivate them into playing until the end, which will ideally soothe their anxiety, and, through repeated usage of the prototype, lessen the degree of their fear of the dark.","This paper discusses the development of a virtual reality (VR) game prototype aimed at helping children aged 7 to 9 overcome their fear of the dark, a common phobia that can impact their quality of life. The study highlights the positive results of a case study involving the prototype, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic tool that utilizes immersive storytelling and game mechanics to encourage children to confront their fears in a controlled environment."
THE FEATURES OF THE BIOMECHANICS IN FOOTBALL PLAYERS ON THE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES OF THE GROIN,2021-03-01,,,,"Pain in the lower abdomen and groin can oc- cur in athletes who perform sharp lower extrem- ity movement during training or sports, make sharp turns and change direction of the trunk movement as well as lower extremity accelera- tion/deceleration. An excessive load during the sports game can disturb the biomechanics of the player’s movements. A precise localization of damaged tissues can improve for the diagnosis, determining treatment and forecasting the time ofreturn to sports. The aim was to estimate the importance of the football biomechanics movement for the anato- my of the groin and to determine the anatomi- cal features of the groin in football players with sports hernia. We analysed the thickness and length measure- ments on MRI of the rectus abdominis muscle in 51 football players of professional and amateur clubs aged 17 to 33 years with groin pain who were treated at the Kyiv Clinical City Hospital No3 for the period 2014-2020. In the second stage of the study, we investigated the peak force of the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis, exter- nal oblique abdominal muscles) and the adductor muscles of both lower extremities using the mi- croFET2 dynamometer for 4 groups of football players. The first group of the study includes 15 football players of professional clubs with sports hernia who had received conservative treatment, the partipants of the second group are 36 football players after laparoscopic hernioplasty, the third group consisted of 54 healthy young football players and 11 teenage footballers. In the third stage of the study, a formula was substantiated, according to which we calculated the accelera- tion of the lower extremity when kicking the ball. The results of the study demostrate that the disruption of the lower extremity biomechanics during kicking the ball cause the appearance of sports hernia in football players. An axial MRI scan of groin areas of football players with sports hernia represented changes in the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis. The groin pain syndrome of football players with sports hernia includes three pathogenetic mechanisms of development: dis- ruption of the biomechanics, muscle imbalance and microtrauma and inflammation.","The paper investigates the impact of biomechanics on the anatomical structures of the groin in football players, specifically focusing on pain in the lower abdomen and groin associated with sharp movements. Through MRI analysis and assessments of muscle strength, the study highlights how disrupted lower extremity biomechanics during kicking can lead to sports hernias, emphasizing the role of muscle imbalance and inflammation in groin pain syndromes among athletes."
Study regarding the effects of sprints on the injury rate of football players,2021-03-01,,,,"Abstract. The football game in Romania begins to be played according to certain scientifically proven benchmarks, which is evidenced by the results and studies published every year. The latest international studies show that photocell-controlled sprinting over a 50-meter distance at an intensity of more than 95% of the player’s maximum potential decreases the risk of injury during a match. This is due to the fact that there are weekly competitive microcycles in which, through the chosen exercises or just by the nature of the position played, many athletes do not experience this scenario during training but they are fully faced with it during a match. Thus, our purpose was to conduct a comparative study in order to observe the effects of sprints on the injury rate of football players during matches across weekly cycles. Participants in this study were 20 professional football players who, according to the established protocol, followed a preventive injury programme including sprints performed at an intensity of over 95%. These exercises must be practised throughout the training period, our study intending to demonstrate that the game activity is the reference point when building training sessions, and each game scenario should be simulated or practised in the training process.","This paper investigates the impact of sprinting on the injury rates of football players, emphasizing the importance of incorporating high-intensity sprinting into training to reduce injury risks during matches. The study involves 20 professional players and highlights that simulating game scenarios in training can help better prepare athletes for the demands faced in competitive situations."
Multi-location external workload profile in U-18 soccer players. [Perfil multi-ubicación de carga externa en jugadores de fútbol sub-18].,2021-02-27,,,,"An association between accelerometer workload and injury risk has been found previously. However, any research has assessed the absorption dynamics of external workload through the measurement in different anatomical locations simultaneously. A cross-sectional study was designed to: (i) to describe the multi-joint external workload profile of youth soccer players, (ii) to identify differences between-participants related to anatomical locations, (iii) to analyze the workload dynamics at different speeds at joints and body segments, (iv) to characterize the multi-joint individual workload and the within-participants difference in each body segment. Twenty-one U-18 male players, that were part of a Youth Spanish First Division soccer team, performed an incremental running treadmill test and wore four WIMU PROTM inertial devices in lower limb (ankle-knee) and spine (lower-upper back) locations to register cumulative tri-axial accelerometry-based workload (PlayerLoad, PLRT). The main results have shown that the highest PLRT was detected at the lower limb, especially at the ankle. Different dynamics of accelerometer workload have been found between lower and upper limb, being them between ankle-knee at 12-km/h and lower-upper back at 9.5-km/h (p&lt;.05). Between-participants’ differences were shown at all joints, finding the highest differences at the upper back (p&lt;.01; d=2.17). Finally, the body segment knee-lower back reported the highest differences (%diff=34.25-to-67.28; d=2.20-to-4.77). In conclusion, a great between-participants external workload variability was found at joints and body segments, being recommended for an individualized assessment and specific training protocols.","This paper examines the external workload profile of U-18 soccer players by measuring workload dynamics across different anatomical locations using accelerometers. Key findings indicate significant variability in workload between participants at various joints, with the highest loads observed at the ankle and notable differences in workload dynamics between the lower and upper limbs, suggesting a need for individualized training protocols."
Analysis of HIC and Hydrostatic Pressure in the Human Head during NOCSAE Tests of American Football Helmets,2021-02-25,,,,"Brain damage is a serious economic and social burden. Contact sports such as American football, are one of the most common sources of concussions. The biomechanical response of the head–helmet system caused by dynamic loading plays a major role. The literature has focused on measuring the resultant kinematics that act on the head and helmet during tackles. However, few studies have focused on helmet validation tests, supported by recent findings and emerging numerical approaches. The future of helmet standards could benefit from insights at the level of injury mechanisms, using numerical tools to assess the helmets. Therefore, in this work, a numerical approach is employed to investigate the influence of intracranial pressure (ICP) on brain pathophysiology during and after helmeted impacts, which are common in American football. The helmeted impacts were performed at several impact locations according to the NOCSAE standard (configurations A, AP, B, C, D, F, R, UT). In order to evaluate the ICP levels, the αHEAD finite element head and brain model was combined with a Hybrid III-neck structure and then coupled with an American football helmet to simulate the NOCSAE impacts. In addition, the ICP level was analyzed together with the resulting HIC value, since the latter is commonly used, in this application and others, as the injury criterion. The obtained results indicate that ICP values exceed the common threshold of head injury criteria and do not correlate with HIC values. Thus, this work raises concern about applying the HIC to predict brain injury in American football direct head impacts, since it does not correlate with ICP predicted with the FE head model.","This paper investigates the influence of intracranial pressure (ICP) on brain pathophysiology during helmeted impacts in American football, emphasizing the need for improved helmet validation tests. The study employs a numerical approach, combining a finite element head model with helmet simulations, revealing that ICP levels often exceed injury thresholds while showing a lack of correlation with commonly used head injury criteria (HIC)."
Long-Term Patterns of Bone Mineral Density in an Elite Soccer Player,2021-02-25,,,,"Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) have been associated with association football (soccer) participation. Seasonal changes in BMD of soccer players have been proposed as well. However, previous investigations were based on short-term observations. Actually, longitudinal investigation of BMD in soccer players is lacking, possibly because of frequent inter-club transfer, changes in club policy or continued availability of the relevant facilities. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)-measured areal BMD (aBMD) was obtained during the competitive season in an elite soccer player along 10 consecutive years. Findings showed that (1) aBMD tends to increase with age, independently of body mass; (2) The right (preferred, kicking) leg has higher aBMD than the left (non-preferred, support) one; (3) Meaningful (i.e., &amp;gt;least significant change, LSC) changes in aBMD take place along the season; and (4) The off-season (transition) period has no effect on aBMD. Findings prompt for future research aimed at clarifying the long-term and seasonal patterns of bone characteristics in soccer in relation with age and type/dose of training. Season-around, long-term scrutiny of bone status in soccer players would help controlling for possible changes/asymmetries in bone mineralization/strength.","This paper investigates the long-term patterns of bone mineral density (BMD) in an elite soccer player through a decade-long longitudinal study. Key findings include an overall increase in areal BMD with age, differences in BMD between the preferred and non-preferred legs, significant seasonal changes in BMD, and the lack of effect from the off-season, highlighting the need for further research on BMD changes related to training in soccer players."
Effect of Lower Back Extensors Fatigue on Athletic Performance Measured as Agility,2021-02-22,,,,"Background: At high level of competition, sports require long periods of hard physical work. Each athlete should be able to perform desired actions efficiently, which will not be possible without coordinated activation of muscles in the kinetic chain. EMG studies demonstrate that lumbar paraspinal muscles fatigue is associated with Quadriceps Inhibition (QI), leading to speculation that these changes may not only have adverse effect for athletic performance but also increase the risk of injury in long term. This contrasts the evidence about the influence of fatigue on trunk muscles reflex activity. Method: 37 athletes (men) were recruited from city soccer clubs. The participants performed sub maximal isometric exercise of lower back extensors (Ito’s test) to induce fatigue. The two protocols were a single bout and repeated bouts of Lumbar Extension Isometric Exercise (LEIE). The Agility scores recorded at baseline, after single bout and after repeated bouts of LEIE were compared. Conclusion: The two experimental interventions differently affected the agility performance in the sample. On one hand, single bout intervention led to improved performance, repeated bout intervention resulted in relative deterioration of performance.","This paper investigates the impact of lower back extensors fatigue on athletic performance, specifically focusing on agility in soccer players. The study compares the effects of single and repeated bouts of lumbar extension isometric exercises on agility scores, finding that while a single bout improved performance, repeated bouts led to a decline."
Validation in Young Soccer Players of the Modified Version of the Harre Circuit Test: The Petrucci Ability Test,2021-02-18,,,,"The evaluation of soccer players’ physical fitness from youth onward is important for monitoring performance and planning training. While health-related factors present valid and reliable tests, the skill-related component should be studied in depth. An interesting test to evaluate the skill-related factors is the Harre circuit test (HTC); unfortunately, this test includes the somersault, an element not present in soccer. The aim of the present study is the validation of the Petrucci ability test (PAT), a variation of the HTC without the somersault for young soccer players. Children and adolescents (age range 10–13 years old) soccer players concluded the 20-m, the HTC and the PAT. To establish the validity of the PAT, correlation analysis has been performed, which presented a p &lt; 0.0001 between PAT and HTC; p &lt; 0.001 between PAT and a 20-m test; and p &lt; 0.0001 between HTC and the 20-m test. The results suggest that the PAT can be a valid substitute for the evaluation of the skills-related components of young soccer players and, consequently, also of athletes and schoolchildren.","This paper focuses on validating the Petrucci Ability Test (PAT) as a modified version of the Harre Circuit Test (HTC) for assessing the skill-related fitness of young soccer players aged 10 to 13. The study demonstrates that the PAT is a valid alternative to the HTC and other fitness tests, indicating its potential use for evaluating young athletes' performance."
Systematic review of screening tools for common soccer injuries and their risk factors,2021-02-12,,,,"Background: Several screening tools are available for use in a clinical setting to predict injury. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the accuracy of these tools to predict soccer-specific injuries. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to determine the psychometric properties or accuracy of screening tools for common soccer injuries. Methods: A systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy was undertaken based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) procedure for conducting systematic reviews. Databases such as SPORT Discus, Cinahl, Medline, Science Direct, PubMed and grey literature were searched in order to access suitable studies. Results: A total of 10 studies were included for the analysis – three were analysed quantitatively whilst the remaining seven were analysed qualitatively. The screening tools were of high reliability, sensitivity and specificity (calculated as intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] (0.68 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–0.84 and 0.64 95% CI: 0.61–0.66, respectively). Conclusion: The screening tools assessed for the prediction of common soccer injuries that emerged from this systematic review include the Functional Movement Screening (FMS™), the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), the Tuck Jump Assessment, the Soccer Injury Movement Screening (SIMS) and the conventional hamstrings to quadriceps ratio; all with good evidence of predicting common soccer injuries. These tools were of high sensitivity and specificity thus reliable for soccer screening. Clinical implications: The validity of these tools is acceptable and therefore the authors recommend that these tools be included in an injury prevention programme for soccer players.","This paper conducts a systematic review of screening tools for predicting common injuries in soccer, assessing their diagnostic accuracy. It identifies several effective tools, such as the Functional Movement Screening and the Soccer Injury Movement Screening, which demonstrate high reliability and specificity, suggesting they should be integrated into injury prevention programs for soccer players."
Weekly variations of biomechanical load variables in professional soccer players: comparisons between playing positions,2021-02-07,,,,"Purpose The purpose of the present study was fourfold: (i) to describe the weekly variations of acute external load measures during a professional soccer season; (ii) to analyse the variability of external load measures within weeks; (iii) to analyse the acute:chronic workload ratio of players during the process; and (iv) to analyse the differences of external load measures between playing positions. Methods Twenty professional soccer players (age: 24.9 ± 3.5 years; body mass: 71.6 ± 18.7 kg; height: 168.8 ± 41.4 cm) from the same team competing in the First Portuguese League (Europe) voluntarily participated in this study. They were daily monitored with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and the following external load variables were extracted per session: (i) total distance; (ii) running distance; (iii) high-speed running distance; (iv) distance at maximal speed; (v) distance at high accelerations; and (vi) players’ training load. The acute load and acute:chronic workload ratio were weekly calculated for each of the GPS measures. Results Week-by-week variations ranged from –57% to +115%, depending on the playing position and the variable measured. The within-week variability revealed coefficients of variation between 48% and 55%, depending on the measure. Considering the differences in mean load between playing positions, significant differences between players were found for the majority of the variables, with the only exceptions being maximal speed and high accelerations distances. Conclusions Great between-week variations in the acute load as well as the variability of load within weeks were found. It was observed that acute load was position-dependent.","This study investigates the weekly variations of biomechanical load measures in professional soccer players, focusing on differences related to playing positions. Key findings indicate significant fluctuations in external load measures and within-week variability, highlighting the position-dependent nature of acute load among players."
Influence of Fatigue on the Rapid Hamstring/Quadriceps Force Capacity in Soccer Players,2021-02-05,,,,"The objective of this study was to examine the effect of fatigue on maximal and rapid force capacities and muscular activation of the knee extensors and flexors. Seventeen professional soccer players volunteered to participate in this study. Peak torque (T peak ) and rate of torque development (RTD) of knee flexor (90°. s –1 , −30°. s –1 ) and extensor (90°. s –1 ) muscles were measured before and after fatigue (i.e., 30 maximal knee extension and flexion repetitions at 180°s –1 ) performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Hamstring to quadriceps peak strength and RTD ratios were calculated. Besides, using surface EMG, the mean level of activation (RMS mean ), Rate of EMG Rise (RER), and EMG Frequency-Time maps were measured on quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Following fatigue, T peak , RTD, RER declined significantly in the two muscle groups (all p &amp;lt; 0.05) without modification of RMS mean . No decrease in conventional and functional H/Q ratios was observed after fatigue except for a significant increase in the H ecc30 / Q con180 ratios (1.03 ± 0.19 vs. 1.36 ± 0.33, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Besides, the RTD H/Q ratios decreased significantly after fatigue, and the statistical parametric mapping analysis (SPM) performed on the EMG/angle curves, and EMG Frequency-Time maps showed that fatigue strongly influenced the muscle activation during the first 100 ms of the movement, following the higher EMG frequency component shift toward the lower frequency component. Our results show that the reduction of RTD and RER during the first 100 ms of the contraction after fatigue exercise makes more sense than any H/Q ratio modification in understanding injury risk in soccer players.","This study investigates the impact of fatigue on the force capacities and muscular activation of knee extensors and flexors in professional soccer players. Key findings indicate significant declines in peak torque and rate of torque development after fatigue, emphasizing the importance of these changes in understanding injury risk rather than conventional strength ratios."
Inter-unit reliability of IMU Step metrics using IMeasureU Blue Trident inertial measurement units for running-based team sport tasks,2021-02-04,,,,"The aim of this study was to determine the inter-unit reliability of IMU Step biomechanical load monitoring metrics using IMeasureU Blue Trident inertial measurement units in tasks common to running-based team sports. Knowledge of variability between units is required before researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions on ""true"" differences between limbs. Sixteen male college soccer players performed five running-based tasks, generating 224 trials and 17,012 steps. Data were analysed for each task and for the whole session, investigating six IMU Step metrics: step count; impact load; bone stimulus; and low, medium and high intensity steps. Inter-unit reliability was excellent (ICC ≥ 0.90) for 21 out of 26 metrics, and good (0.83 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.86) for all other metrics except for Yo-Yo impact load (ICC = 0.79) which was acceptable. These findings confirm the inter-unit reliability of IMU Step metrics using IMeasureU Blue Trident inertial measurement units for running-based team sports. Now that inter-unit variability has been quantified, researchers and practitioners can use this information when interpreting inter-limb differences for monitoring external biomechanical training load.","This study examines the inter-unit reliability of biomechanical load monitoring metrics derived from IMeasureU Blue Trident inertial measurement units in running-based tasks common to team sports, specifically soccer. The findings demonstrate excellent to good reliability for most of the metrics, highlighting their potential utility in accurately monitoring external biomechanical training load and inter-limb differences among athletes."
Risk Factors for Contra-Lateral Secondary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,2021-01-30,,,,"Abstract Background The risk of sustaining a contra-lateral anterior cruciate ligament (C-ACL) injury after primary unilateral ACL injury is high. C-ACL injury often contributes to a further decline in function and quality of life, including failure to return to sport. There is, however, very limited knowledge about which risk factors that contribute to C-ACL injury. Objective To systematically review instrinsic risk factors for sustaining a C-ACL injury. Methods A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Sport Discus) were searched from inception to January 2020. Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective studies investigating any intrinsic risk factor for future C-ACL injury. Meta-analysis was performed and expressed as odds ratios (OR) if two or more articles assessed the same risk factor. Results 44 moderate-to-high quality studies were eventually included in this review, whereof 35 studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including up to 59 000 individuals. We identified seven factors independently increasing the odds of sustaining a C-ACL injury (in order of highest to lowest OR): (1) returning to a high activity level (OR 3.26, 95% CI 2.10–5.06); (2) Body Mass Index &lt; 25 (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.73–4.36); (3) age ≤ 18 years (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.51–3.88); (4) family history of ACL injury (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.54–2.80); (5) primary ACL reconstruction performed ≤ 3 months post injury (OR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.32–2.06); (6) female sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14–1.61); and (7) concomitant meniscal injury (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.42). The following two factors were associated with decreased odds of a subsequent C-ACL injury: 1) decreased intercondylar notch width/width of the distal femur ratio (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25–0.69) and 2) concomitant cartilage injury (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69–1.00). There were no associations between the odds of sustaining a C-ACL injury and smoking status, pre-injury activity level, playing soccer compared to other sports or timing of return to sport. No studies of neuromuscular function in relation to risk of C-ACL injury were eligible for meta-analysis according to our criteria. Conclusion This review provides evidence that demographic factors such as female sex, young age (≤ 18 years) and family history of ACL injury, as well as early reconstruction and returning to a high activity level increase the risk of C-ACL injury. Given the lack of studies related to neuromuscular factors that may be modifiable by training, future studies are warranted that investigate the possible role of factors such as dynamic knee stability and alignment, muscle activation and/or strength and proprioception as well as sport-specific training prior to return-to-sport for C-ACL injuries. PROSPERO : CRD42020140129.","This systematic review identifies intrinsic risk factors for sustaining a contra-lateral anterior cruciate ligament (C-ACL) injury following a primary ACL injury, highlighting key factors such as young age, female sex, family history of ACL injury, and early return to high activity levels. The paper emphasizes the need for further research into modifiable neuromuscular factors, suggesting that aspects like dynamic knee stability and sport-specific training could play a critical role in reducing these risks."
"Lower-Limb Muscle Strength, Anterior-Posterior and Inter-Limb Asymmetry in Professional, Elite Academy and Amateur Soccer Players",2021-01-30,,,,"Given the importance of the lower-limb strength and strength balance in soccer players and its relationship with injury prevention and performance, the present study compared quadriceps and hamstrings strength, the conventional (H&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;:Q&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;), functional (H&lt;sub&gt;ecc&lt;/sub&gt;:Q&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;) hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and inter-limb strength asymmetry in professional, elite academy and amateur male soccer players. In this cross-sectional study, two hundred-six soccer players (professional = 75, elite academy = 68, amateurs = 63) volunteered to participate. Quadriceps and hamstrings isokinetic peak torque was investigated at 60&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in both the concentric and eccentric modality and at 300&lt;sup&gt;°.&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the concentric modality. The conventional H&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;:Q&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;, functional H&lt;sub&gt;ecc&lt;/sub&gt;:Q&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt; ratio and quadriceps and hamstrings inter-limb strength asymmetry were then calculated. Professional players presented greater quadriceps and hamstrings strength than elite academy (effect size from small to moderate) and amateur players (moderate to very large). Both the conventional H&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt;:Q&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt; and functional H&lt;sub&gt;ecc&lt;/sub&gt;:Q&lt;sub&gt;conc&lt;/sub&gt; ratio were greater in professional than elite academy and amateur players (small to moderate). Overall, quadriceps and hamstrings inter-limb strength asymmetry was greater in amateurs than professional (small to very large) and elite academy (trivial to large) players. The present findings provide coaches and medical staffs with normative lower-limb muscle strength data on professional, academy and amateur soccer players. Overall lower-limb muscle strength and inter-limb strength asymmetry could be used to evaluate possible inference on injury prevention and performance. The hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio poorly differentiates between the soccer players background and offers limited prediction for injury prevention and performance.","The paper investigates the lower-limb muscle strength and inter-limb asymmetry in professional, elite academy, and amateur male soccer players, focusing on the relationship between strength and injury prevention. It finds that professional players exhibit greater muscle strength and lower asymmetry compared to their amateur counterparts, providing critical normative data for coaches and medical staff regarding player performance and injury risk."
Heading in Soccer: Does Kinematics of the Head‐Neck‐Torso Alignment Influence Head Acceleration?,2021-01-30,,,,"There is little scientific evidence regarding the cumulative effect of purposeful heading. The head-neck-torso alignment is considered to be of great importance when it comes to minimizing potential risks when heading. Therefore, this study determined the relationship between head-neck-torso alignment (cervical spine, head, thoracic spine) and the acceleration of the head, the relationship between head acceleration and maximum ball speed after head impact and differences between head accelerations throughout different heading approaches (standing, jumping, running). A total of 60 male soccer players (18.9 ± 4.0 years, 177.6 ± 14.9 cm, 73.1 ± 8.6 kg) participated in the study. Head accelerations were measured by a telemetric Noraxon DTS 3D Sensor, whereas angles for the head-neck-torso alignment and ball speed were analyzed with a Qualisys Track Manager program. No relationship at all was found for the standing, jumping and running approaches. Concerning the relationship between head acceleration and maximum ball speed after head impact only for the standing header a significant result was calculated (p = 0.024, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .085). A significant difference in head acceleration (p &lt; .001) was identified between standing, jumping and running headers. To sum up, the relationship between head acceleration and head-neck-torso alignment is more complex than initially assumed and could not be proven in this study. Furthermore first data were generated to check whether the acceleration of the head is a predictor for the resulting maximum ball speed after head impact, but further investigations have to follow. Lastly, we confirmed the results that the head acceleration differs with the approach.","This paper investigates the relationship between head-neck-torso alignment and head acceleration during various heading techniques in soccer. The study found that while head acceleration differs significantly between standing, jumping, and running approaches, no consistent relationship was established between alignment and acceleration, highlighting the complexity of this relationship and the need for further research."
The effect of change of direction angle on kneeand hip biomechanics : implications foranterior cruciate ligament injury,2021-01-29,,,,"ACL injuries have been referred to poor mechanics as they frequently occur without contact. Changes in the knee valgus (abduction) angle and knee valgus (external abduction) moment and limb asymmetry have been linked to greater risk of ACL
injury. Change of direction (COD) manoeuvres are important for many field sports, however they are unfortunately associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. There is limited literature exploring the associations between lower-limb biomechanical variables during COD manoeuvre associated with ACL injuries. Although players frequently COD at >90° angles, limited knowledge is available on hip and knee joints kinematics and kinetics in term of limb asymmetry and differences between COD at 90° and 135° manoeuvres. In addition, high knee valgus angle and moment during COD manoeuvre is associated with joint positions including increased hip flexion, abduction and internal rotation angles. In addition, isometric hip muscle strength has been reported to predict ACL injuries, indicating that weakness in hip muscles is a modifiable risk factor of the non-contact ACL
injury. However, the relationship between knee valgus angle and moment with hip kinematics and muscle strength during COD at 90° and 135° manoeuvres still unknown. Currently, there has been no published research correlating the hip abductor, extensor, and external rotator strength on frontal plane hip and knee biomechanics during 90° and 135° COD manoeuvres. Therefore, the purposes of this thesis was to (1) determine whether asymmetry in knee and hip biomechanics kinematics and kinetics and hip muscle strength between preferred and nonpreferred limbs during COD manoeuvres at 90° and 135° angles exists, (2)
determine whether differences in knee and hip biomechanics kinematics and kinetics between COD manoeuvres at 90° and 135° angles exists and (3) explore the relationships between ACL injury risk factors (knee valgus angle and moment) and hip kinematics and muscles strength during 90° and 135° COD manoeuvres.
Three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis technique is a gold stander to assess biomechanical lower-limb during functional activities. In fact, the gold standard for examining lower limb biomechanics is 3D motion analysis system and allows researchers to calculate all three motion planes during dynamic manoeuvres. In
addition, the isokinetic dynamometer has been considered as a gold standard measurement tool for assessing isometric hip muscle strength and become more popular in sport, research and clinic setting. Healthy male recreational soccer players performed COD manoeuvres at 90° and 135° angles and maximal voluntary
isometric contractions of the hip abductors, extensors, and external rotators. From recorded motion capture, ground reaction force data and hip and knee biomechanics as well as, hip muscles peak torque were calculated. To determine limb asymmetry,
a paired sample t-test was conducted using a Holm method correction. Then, pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was used to explore the relationships between hip kinematics and strength and knee valgus angle and moment. 36 individuals took part in the study (24.25 ±6.21 years, 1.72 ±0.06 m and 66.41 ±10.83 kg). At 135° COD, participants showed greater knee valgus angles at initial
contact and greater peak external knee abduction moments than at 90°. However, no effect of COD angles on knee flexion angle and peak vGRF were found. The results suggest that there were no differences between preferred and non-preferred limbs. Furthermore, the results highlight an important role the hip motion play in controlling kinematic and kinetic risk factors of ACL injury during COD manoeuvres. The findings provided some support that excessive knee valgus angle and moment is potentially associated with poor hip control in all planes. However, there were no
significant correlation between hip muscles strength and knee frontal plane kinetics and kinematics. It can be concluded that different COD angles demand different hip and knee kinematics and kinetics. The results suggest that sharper COD angle place the knee at more risk for ACL injuries. COD manoeuvres at 90° may be useful for evaluating of individuals but may not be challenging enough to reveal poor neuromuscular control over hip and knee motion. Therefore, sharper angles of examination should be utilized in the evaluation of individuals. Moreover, these results may help provide an appropriate manipulation and intervention on COD manoeuvre to reduce the risk of ACL injury. The findings of this study will increase the knowledge base of ACL injury and can aid in the design of more appropriate neuromuscular and plyometric
training protocols for injury prevention.","This paper investigates the relationship between change of direction (COD) angles and knee and hip biomechanics, specifically focusing on the risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Key findings indicate that sharper COD angles (135°) lead to greater knee valgus angles and external knee abduction moments, highlighting the importance of hip control in mitigating ACL injury risks during athletic maneuvers."
Accelerometry-Workload Indices Concerning Different Levels of Participation during Congested Fixture Periods in Professional Soccer: A Pilot Study Conducted over a Full Season,2021-01-28,,,,"The aim of this study was to analyze the variations of acute load (AL), acute: chronic workload ratio (ACWR), training monotony (TM), and training strain (TS) of accelerometry-based GPS measures in players who started in three matches (S3M), two matches (S2M), and one match (S1M) during congested weeks. Nineteen elite professional male players from a Portuguese team (age: 26.5 ± 4.3 years) were monitored daily using global positioning systems (GPSs) over a full season (45 weeks). Accelerometry-derived measures of high metabolic load distance (HMLD), high accelerations (HA), and high decelerations (HD) were collected during each training session and match. Seven congested weeks were classified throughout the season, and the participation of each player in matches played during these weeks was codified. The workload indices of AL (classified as ACWR, TM, and TS) were calculated weekly for each player. The AL of HMLD was significantly greater for S2M than S1M (difference = 42%; p = 0.002; d = 0.977) and for S3M than S1M (difference = 44%; p = 0.001; d = 1.231). Similarly, the AL of HA was significantly greater for S2M than S1M (difference = 25%; p = 0.023; d = 0.735). The TM of HD was significantly greater for S2M than S3M (difference = 25%; p = 0.002; d = 0.774). Accelerometry-based measures were dependent on congested fixtures. S2M had the greatest TS values, while S3M had the greatest TM.","This paper investigates the relationship between various accelerometry-based workload indices and participation levels during congested fixture periods in professional soccer. Key findings indicate that the acute load metrics, including high metabolic load distance and high accelerations, varied significantly based on the number of matches played, with different implications for training strain and training monotony."
"Effects of Complex Training on Sprint, Jump, and Change of Direction Ability of Soccer Players: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2021-01-22,,,,"The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of complex training (CT) on sprint, jump, and change of direction (COD) ability among soccer players. After an electronic search, 10 peer-reviewed articles were considered in the meta-analysis. The athletes included in this meta-analysis were amateur to professional level male soccer players (age range, 14–23 years). These studies incorporated CT in soccer players who were compared to a control group. Significant moderate to large improvements were observed in the CT group [sprint: standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.92–1.91; jump: SMD = 0.96–1.58; COD: SMD = 0.97–1.49] when compared to control groups. Subgroup analysis were also conducted based on age, duration, and competitive level. The beneficial effects of CT were greater in players &amp;lt;18 vs. ≥18 years (linear sprinting; SMD = 2.01 vs. −0.13), after ≥8 vs. &amp;lt;8 weeks (jumping and COD; SMD = 1.55–2.01 vs. 0.31–0.64, respectively) and among professional vs. amateur players (linear sprinting and with COD; SMD = 1.53–1.58 vs. 0.08–0.63, respectively). In conclusion, regular soccer training programs may be supplemented with CT to improve sprint, jump, and COD performance. A longer duration of CT (≥8 weeks) seems to be optimal in improving the physical abilities of soccer players. Professional players and &amp;lt;18 years players may benefit more from CT program.","This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the impact of complex training (CT) on the sprinting, jumping, and change of direction abilities of soccer players. The findings indicate significant improvements in these performance metrics, particularly in players under 18 years old, with a training duration of at least 8 weeks showing optimal benefits."
The Effect of Player Contact Characteristics on Head Impact Exposure in Youth Football Games,2021-01-22,,,,"To reduce head impact exposure (HIE) in youth football, further understanding of the context in which head impacts occur and the associated biomechanics is needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of contact characteristics on HIE during player versus player contact scenarios in youth football. Head impact data and time-synchronized video were collected from 4 youth football games over 2 seasons in which opposing teams were instrumented with the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System. Coded contact characteristics included the player's role in the contact, player speed and body position, contact height, type, and direction, and head contact surface. Head accelerations were compared among the contact characteristics using mixed-effects models. Among 72 instrumented athletes, 446 contact scenarios (n = 557 impacts) with visible opposing instrumented players were identified. When at least one player had a recorded impact, players who were struck tended to have higher rotational acceleration than players in striking positions. When both players had a recorded impact, lighter players and taller players experienced higher mean head accelerations compared with heavier players and shorter players. Understanding the factors influencing HIE during contact events in football may help inform methods to reduce head injury risk.","This paper investigates the impact characteristics associated with head impact exposure (HIE) during youth football games, focusing on player contact scenarios. It highlights the influence of contact role, player speed, body position, and physical attributes on head accelerations, providing insights that may aid in developing strategies to reduce head injury risk in youth football."
Biomechanical Analysis of the Tuck Jump Assessment,2021-01-22,,,,"Nascimento, N, Sideris, V, and Read, PJ. Biomechanical analysis of the tuck jump assessment. J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2946-2949, 2022-The tuck jump assessment (TJA) examines plyometric technique flaws associated with the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Biomechanical data to investigate the mechanics used during the TJA are limited and assessing each jump individually across the entire test period is time inefficient. This study examined performance characteristics and movement mechanics in 16 professional soccer players during a standardized TJA protocol (10 jumps) to determine if sensitive periods exist within the test period (first 5 vs. last 5). Jump height, average power (PW) reactive strength index (RSI), frontal plane projection angle (FPPA), knee angular velocity (AV), and peak knee flexion angle (PKA) were analyzed using an optoelectrical and inertial measurement unit device. Jump height and PW increased in the past 5 jumps displaying a medium effect size (d = > 0.5). A trend was observed of increased AV, FPPA, and PKA during the past 5 jumps; however, no meaningful differences were observed between respective jump phases, and effect sizes were small (d ≤ 0.2). This study indicates that performance metrics increase during the past 5 jumps of a standardized TJA 10-jump protocol; thus, analyzing the entire test period may not be required, providing a time-efficient approach. Caution should be applied if using this protocol as an injury risk screening tool or to identify fatigue related alterations in male professional soccer players as no obvious movement abnormalities were apparent and minimal differences were present between jump phases in a range of kinematic variables across the recorded test duration.","This paper examines the biomechanics of the tuck jump assessment (TJA) to identify potential injury risks for athletes, specifically professional soccer players. The findings suggest that performance metrics improve during the later jumps of a 10-jump protocol, indicating a need for more efficient testing approaches, while caution is advised regarding its use as an injury risk screening tool due to minimal observed movement abnormalities."
Occurrence of asymmetries of lower limbs in basic futsal athletes,2021-01-20,,,,"Futsal is a sport on the rise worldwide, attracting more and more new practitioners and as well as in field soccer, it has undergone changes in recent years, increasingly demanding athletes, becoming a high impact sport, promoting overload, in the short, medium and long term, predisposing to injury to different degrees of the locomotor apparatus. The aim of this study was to analyze lower limbs asymmetries in futsal-based athletes, as well as their relationship to the incidence of injuries. The study was developed with 47 athletes of the basic category, futsal, from a city in the interior of the state of São Paulo, where functional tests were performed with the help of the PHAST application. A pattern of similarity was identified between the muscle groups tested, except for the gluteus muscle, presenting a significant difference. According to the indicators found, the patterns of strength deficit of the middle glutes may trigger, or predispose to, some types of biomechanical lesions whether proximal, in the hip region, or distal, as dysfunctions in the knee joint. When an athlete presents with a weakness of this muscle, ipsilateral femur adduction, increased medial rotation and fall of the pelvis against lateral, promoting increased dynamic angle of the knee, increasing the overload in this joint. Thus, it is concluded that pre-season evaluation is important to identify possible asymmetries, implementing preventive work to correct them, in order to minimize the risks of injuries.","This paper investigates lower limb asymmetries in basic futsal athletes and their correlation with injury incidence. It highlights a significant disparity in strength among muscle groups, particularly the gluteus muscle, which may elevate the risk of biomechanical injuries in the hip and knee regions."
"Standard RTS criteria effectiveness verification using FMS, Y-balance and TJA in footballers following ACL reconstruction and mild lower limb injuries",2021-01-15,,,,"Abstract The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently injured knee ligament. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that patients following ACL reconstruction may present motor deficits which may be related to increased risk of injury. The objective of the study was to determine whether players who have passed RTS assessment still have deficits in movement patterns or in neuromuscular control after such a serious injury as ACL rupture and reconstruction,. Sixty-five male football players (age 18–25 years), recruited from regional teams, were divided into three groups: (1) ACL group-subjects after ACL rupture and reconstruction (n = 24); (2) Mild Injury (MI) group-subjects after mild lower limb injuries (n = 21); and (3) Control (C) group-subjects without injuries (n = 20). For all groups, the Y-balance test, Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and Tuck Jump Assessment (TJA) were performed. For the Y-balance test in ACL group for the injured leg, significantly lower values were demonstrated for anterior reach ((ACL) 69.2 ± 5.7% vs. (MI) 74.8 ± 4.5% vs. (C) 74.0 ± 5.6%), at posterior-lateral reach ((ACL) 103.2 ± 6.4% vs. (C) 108.5 ± 6.0%) and composite score ((ACL) 93.9 ± 4.4% vs. (MI) 97.9 ± 4.3%) in comparison to the remaining two groups. In the FMS test, the ACL group had significantly lower composite score (12 ± 4 points) compared to the C group (15 ± 2 points). Also, compared to the remaining groups, subjects following ACL reconstruction demonstrated significantly lower performance in the TJA test related to the following elements: thighs do not reach parallel, thighs not equal side-to-side, foot placement not shoulder width apart, technique declines prior to 10 s and lower extremity valgus at landing. The authors have observed that athletes after ACL reconstruction still have deficits in movement patterns or in neuromuscular control despite passing the RTS and being cleared to perform sports. Creating a set of sufficiently sensitive assessment methods may significantly reduce the potential risk of injury due to the fact that diagnosed and monitored deficits may be treated on an ongoing basis. The authors suggest that individual elements of the Y-balance and TJA tests may be suitable for such specific assessment.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of return-to-sport (RTS) criteria using the Y-balance test, Functional Movement Screen (FMS), and Tuck Jump Assessment (TJA) in football players post-ACL reconstruction and mild injuries. It identifies significant deficits in movement patterns and neuromuscular control in athletes cleared for sport, highlighting the need for sensitive assessment methods to reduce injury risks."
Research on women’s football: a scoping review,2021-01-08,,,,"Aim: This study aims to scope available peer-reviewed literature published in a FIFA language to understand the current quantity of research on women’s football.Methods: Five databases were searched on the 15/12/2019. Studies were included when containing original research published in a peer-reviewed journal around female competitive football of any level, any age and on any subject. Author, journal, title and abstract of all included studies were scoped. Population assessed number of participants, level of play, age level of football and publication theme(s) were extracted.Results: A total of 1,634 articles were scoped. The oldest publication dated back to 1939, whilst a total of 202 studies were gathered from 2019. The publication theme most frequently researched was sports medicine (N = 521) followed by strength and conditioning (N = 331) and sociology (N = 299). The majority of studies has focussed on elite (N = 442), senior (N = 977) players.Conclusion: A continuous growth in research attention has been seen. However, the numbers are not comparable to current research output levels in men’s football. This study represents an essential first step in a larger ‘research agenda-setting’ project to determine research priorities for women’s football during the next 10 years.","This paper conducts a scoping review to assess the quantity and themes of peer-reviewed literature on women’s football. It identifies a significant focus on sports medicine, strength and conditioning, and sociology, highlighting the growing but still limited research attention compared to men's football, and aims to set research priorities for the future."
Anterior cruciate ligament injury patterns and their relationship to fatigue and physical fitness levels – a cross-sectional study,2021-01-08,,,,"Abstract Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common knee injuries that leads to many consequences such as early osteoarthritis and knee joint instability. To explore the association of the types of ACL tear (complete and partial) and side of injury (dominant vs nondominate) with types of playing surfaces, sports, shoes, and mechanism of injuries as well as to determine whether higher levels of fatigue and physical fitness are risk factors for complete ACL tear. This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire to collect information from young male adults with a confirmed ACL injury who were attending rehabilitation programs. The outcomes of interest were patterns of ACL injury, levels of fatigue before the injury on a 0 to 10 scale, and levels of physical fitness (hours per week). Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to assess the differences between groups, while the odds ratios were calculated to evaluate risk factors for complete ACL tear. One hundred thirteen young male adults with a confirmed ACL injury were enrolled. Most of the reported ACL injuries in this study were complete tear (80.5%) and occurred more frequently in the dominant leg (74.6%) due to noncontact mechanism (63.6%). More ACL injuries happened while playing soccer (97.2%) on artificial turf (53.3%). The level of fatigue before ACL injury was significantly higher in partial ACL tear injuries compared to complete ACL tear injuries ( P = .014). For every 1-point increase in the level of fatigue on a 0–10 scale, there was a 25% reduction in complete ACL injury risk ( P = .023). The pattern of ACL types of tear and side of injury varies in different playing surfaces and mechanisms of injuries. Higher levels of fatigue seem to be associated with a partial tear of the ACL and reduction of a complete ACL tear risk factor.","This paper investigates the patterns of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in relation to fatigue and physical fitness levels among young male adults. It finds that most ACL injuries are complete tears occurring in the dominant leg while playing soccer on artificial turf, and suggests that higher pre-injury fatigue is associated with partial tears, indicating complex relationships between injury types and fitness factors."
Comparison of Modular Control during Side Cutting before and after Fatigue,2021-01-07,,,,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the coordination between the trunk and lower limb muscles during sidestep and to compare this coordination before and after fatigue intervention. The intervention was lateral jump until exhaustion. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to extract muscle synergies from electromyography. Subsequently, to compare the muscle synergies, a scalar product that evaluates the coincidence of synergies was calculated. Three muscle synergies were extracted before and after the intervention from the NMF analysis. In accordance with the evaluation of the scalar product, these synergies were the same before and after the intervention. One of these synergies that engaged the internal oblique/transversus abdominis, rectus femoris, and adductor muscle was activated from before landing to midstance during sidestep motion; therefore, this synergy is thought to suppress excessive hip abduction. However, the activation timing of this synergy was delayed after the intervention ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.028</mn></math> , effect size: 0.54, Wilcoxon test). This delay is considered to decrease hip stability. Thus, this change may induce a reduction in hip control function.","This study examines the coordination of trunk and lower limb muscles during sidestep movements, comparing the coordination before and after a fatigue-inducing intervention. The results indicate that while muscle synergies remain consistent, the timing of activation for a key synergy is delayed after fatigue, potentially reducing hip stability and control."
"The Goal Scale: A New Instrument to Measure the Perceived Exertion in Soccer (Indoor, Field, and Beach) Players",2021-01-07,,,,"The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can be used to monitor the exercise intensity during laboratory and specific tests, training sessions, and to estimate the internal training load of the athletes. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a specific pictorial perceived exertion scale for soccer players (indoor, field, and beach soccer) called GOAL Scale. The pictorial GOAL Scale (six drawings; 1 “low exertion” to 6 “exhaustion”) was validated for twenty under-17 soccer players (16.4 ± 0.68 years; 175.4 ± 9 cm; 66.4 ± 7.7 kg; % fat mass 12.4 ± 3.3). In the validation phase, the athletes were evaluated in a progressive protocol involving stimuluses of 3 min with 1 min for the rest into the stages until the voluntary exhaustion in Maximal Cardiopulmonary Effort Test (MCET), and in the Yo Yo Intermittent Recovery Test – Level 1 (Yo-Yo). The RPE identified by the GOL Scale, by the Borg Scale 6 – 20 and by the Cavasini Scale, as well as the heart rate (HR), perceptual of the heart rate (%HR max ) and the blood lactate concentration ([La]) were immediately evaluated after each stage of both tests. Spearman’s correlation coefficient ( p &amp;lt; 0.05) was used. Construct scale validity was examined by regressing GOAL Scale against Borg Scale 6 – 20 and Cavasini Scale and concurrent scale validity was investigated by regressing GOAL Scale against HR, beats/min and blood lactate concentration (mmol/L) during two progressive tests. There was a significant correlation values of the GOAL Scale with Borg Scale ( r = 0.93; r = 0.88), Cavasini Scale ( r = 0.91; r = 0.90), %HR max ( r = 0.91; r = 0,86), HR ( r = 0.87; r = 0.83) and lactate ( r = 0.68; r = 0.83) during tests (Maximal Incremental Cardiopulmonary Test and Yo-Yo test, respectively). The results evidenced concurrent and construct validity of the GOAL Scale across a wide range of exercise intensity. The absence of verbal anchors makes the use of this instrument to soccer, futsal and beach soccer athletes of different languages and different literacy levels possible.","The paper presents the development and validation of the GOAL Scale, a pictorial tool designed to measure perceived exertion in soccer players, applicable across indoor, field, and beach formats. The study demonstrates the scale's significant correlations with established measures of exertion, indicating its validity and potential for use with athletes regardless of language or literacy levels."
"Isokinetic Strength, Bilateral and Unilateral Strength Differences: Variation by Age and Laterality in Elite Youth Football Players",2021-01-06,,,,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of age on peak torque (PT) relative strength measures of knee extensors (KE) and knee flexors (KF), bilateral strength ratio (Q:Q, H:H), and ipsilateral strength ratio (H:Q) in youth elite male football players.Elite male players (n = 70) from four age categories (U16: n = 20, U17: n = 20, U19: n = 15, U21: n = 15) performed isokinetic strength tests using a Cybex dynamometer. Results show a significant effect of age on PTKE (F3,142 = 4.54, p = 0.005, = 0.09) and PTKF (age: F3,142 = 3.07, p = 0.030, = 0.06). No significant effect of age on unilateral (F3,142 = 1.05, p = 0.375, = 0.02) or ipsilateral strength ratio (F3,142 = 2.63, p = 0.053, = 0.06) was found. Results revealed significant differences in PTKE for nondominant limbs between U16 and U21. Higher bilateral differences were detected for flexors (H:H = 7.94-11.47 %, Q:Q = 7.97-9.29 %) compared to extensors. Our study showed that 17-year-old players have levels of strength similar to U19 players. A higher bilateral difference of knee flexors than extensors was found, suggesting that more attention should be paid to knee flexors. No effect of laterality was found for strength and strength asymmetries. Future research should also focus on ipsilateral strength ratio in late stage of maturation.","This study examines the impact of age on peak torque and strength ratios of knee extensors and flexors in elite youth male football players across different age categories. Findings indicate significant age-related differences in knee extensor and flexor strength but no notable effects on unilateral and ipsilateral strength ratios, highlighting a more pronounced bilateral difference in knee flexors that warrants further investigation."
"Alternative upper configurations during agility-based movements: part 1, biomechanical performance",2021-01-02,,,,"The objective of this research was to determine if three alternative shoe closures improve biomechanical performance measures compared to a standard lace closure in agility-based movements. NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four court-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump Repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump Repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step Drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior Drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Panel. Movement completion time, Ground contact time, peak eccentric rate of force development (RFD), peak concentric GRF, peak concentric COM power, eccentric work, and concentric work were measured. The Y Wrap configuration the Tri Panel configuration delivered improvements between 3 and 9% over the Standard Closure depending on the movement tested and variable of interest. The Lace Replacement had mixed results with some improvements and some declines in performance. This study allowed for the mechanical properties of the shoe bottom package to remain consistent across designs to examine if alternative upper configurations could enhance performance. We hypothesise that improved containment and possibly increased proprioception—due to the wrapping fit of the configurations influences these changes in performance. These findings suggest that the design and construction shoe upper is essential to consider in athletic shoe design.","This research investigates the impact of three alternative shoe closure designs on biomechanical performance during agility-based movements, comparing them to a standard lace closure. The findings indicate that the Y Wrap and Tri Panel configurations enhance performance metrics by 3 to 9%, suggesting that shoe upper design significantly influences athletic performance."
Youth sport injury research: a narrative review and the potential of interdisciplinarity,2021-01-01,,,,"To prevent sports injuries, researchers have aimed to understand injury aetiology from both the natural and social sciences and through applying different methodologies. This research has produced strong disciplinary knowledge and a number of injury prevention programmes. Yet, the injury rate continues to be high, especially in youth sport and youth football. A key reason for the continued high injury rate is the development of injury prevention programmes based on monodisciplinary knowledge that does not account for the complex nature of sport injury aetiology. The purpose of this paper is to consider and outline an interdisciplinary research process to research the complex nature of sport injury aetiology. To support our proposition, we first present a narrative review of existing youth football and youth sport injury research demonstrating an absence of paradigmatic integration across the research areas’ main disciplines of biomedicine, psychology and sociology. We then demonstrate how interdisciplinary research can address the complexity of youth sport injury aetiology. Finally, we introduce the interdisciplinary process we have recently followed in a youth football injury research project. While further research is necessary, particularly regarding the integration of qualitative and quantitative sport injury data, we propose that the pragmatic interdisciplinary research process can be useful for researchers who aim to work across disciplines and paradigms and aim to employ methodological pluralism in their research.","This paper explores the complex aetiology of sports injuries in youth, particularly in youth football, highlighting the limitations of monodisciplinary approaches to injury prevention. It advocates for an interdisciplinary research process that integrates insights from biomedicine, psychology, and sociology to better address the persistent high injury rates in youth sports."
Under-exposure to official matches is associated with muscle injury incidence in professional footballers,2021-01-01,,,,"External workload from matches is considered one of the most important muscle injury risk factors for football teams. However, there is scarce published evidence to support this belief. This study examined whether a particular profile of external match workload existed prior to a muscle injury. A total of 144 professional football players belonging to 2 teams were monitored over three seasons. For each muscle injury, a profile of external workload variables was determined for 5 to 8 games and expressed as: time playing exposure, total distance (TD) covered and high-speed running (HSR) covered. In addition, acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) was calculated. Sixty players (41.6%) reported a total of 86 muscle injuries during the three seasons. Muscle injuries occurred principally in matches (79.1%), the hamstring being the most affected muscle (44.1%). Injured players displayed substantially lower accumulated exposure time (ES = 0.45), TD (ES = 0.45) and HSR (ES = 0.39) in comparison with uninjured players in the last 5 games prior to injury. Compared to the uninjured players, ACWR for exposure (ES = -0.29/0.02) and running load (ES = -0.24/0.00) did not differ between match 5 and 2 prior to the injury, although uninjured players displayed a substantially greater ACWR in all 3 variables (ES = 0.31/0.35) than injured players in match 1 prior to the injury. Lower playing exposure (minutes played) and associated reduced running distances (TD and HSR) were observed in injured football players. Being under-loaded in official games could be a mediator for muscle injury in this cohort of elite football players.","This paper investigates the relationship between match exposure and muscle injury incidence in professional footballers, focusing on the external workload before injuries occur. Findings indicate that injured players have significantly lower accumulated playing time, total distance covered, and high-speed running compared to uninjured players, suggesting that insufficient match exposure may increase the risk of muscle injuries."
Smart sensor tights: Movement tracking of the lower limbs in football,2021-01-01,,,,"Abstract This article presents a novel smart sensor garment with integrated miniaturized inertial measurements units (IMUs) that can be used to monitor lower body kinematics during daily training activities, without the need of extensive technical assistance throughout the measurements. The smart sensor tights enclose five ultra-light sensor modules that measure linear accelerations, angular velocities, and the earth magnetic field in three directions. The modules are located at the pelvis, thighs, and shanks. The garment enables continuous measurement in the field at high sample rates (250 Hz) and the sensors have a large measurement range (32 g, 4,000°/s). They are read out by a central processing unit through an SPI bus, and connected to a centralized battery in the waistband. A fully functioning prototype was built to perform validation studies in a lab setting and in a field setting. In the lab validation study, the IMU data (converted to limb orientation data) were compared with the kinematic data of an optoelectronic measurement system and good validity (CMCs &gt;0.8) was shown. In the field tests, participants experienced the tights as comfortable to wear and they did not feel restricted in their movements. These results show the potential of using the smart sensor tights on a regular base to derive lower limb kinematics in the field.",This paper presents the development of smart sensor tights equipped with miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMUs) for monitoring lower body movement in football training. The study validates the accuracy of the sensor data for limb orientation and demonstrates the garment's comfort and practicality for continuous field measurements.
"Diversity of scoring, ingenuity of striking, art of flying — conceptual and systematical identification of soccer scoring techniques",2021-01-01,,,,"The terms of soccer scoring techniques (SSTs) used in practice and research have been remaining confusing; even dramatic, we still do not know how many SSTs available for the game. This scenario hinders not only the scientific studies on some unique SSTs but also the development of novel coaching methods for learning these SSTs. The current paper aims to bridge the gap by establishing a SST terminology system. The system is built based on goal repeatability, selected anatomical &amp; biomechanical parameters, and analyses of 579 attractive goals from international professional tournaments. The results have revealed that there are 43 SSTs existed in current soccer practice. Some SSTs can be identified by preliminary parameters (i.e. anatomical parameters, the ball vertical position at the shot and the hit-point on the ball), but most of them need additional biomechanical examination on the movement control in frontal &amp; transverse planes, jumping control, and trunk orientation at shots in order to identify uniquely. Further, the new SST terminology has disclosed that soccer attractiveness is linked to the diversity, ingenuity and artistry of shots. The most attractive type of scoring awaited by millions of spectators is aerial shots. Lastly, the most important contribution of the new SST terminology system is to help researchers and practitioners launch target-orientated studies that would provide a practical and convincing scientific coach-method, clear definitions, and means to reevaluate and improve SSTs in practice.","This paper focuses on the conceptual and systematic identification of soccer scoring techniques (SSTs) to clarify the confusion surrounding their terminology in both practice and research. The study identifies 43 distinct SSTs based on a detailed analysis of attractive goals and emphasizes the necessity of biomechanical examination for accurate categorization, ultimately aiming to enhance coaching methods and promote targeted research in soccer."
Effects of short-term strength and jumping exercises distribution on soccer player’s physical fitness,2021-01-01,,,,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of short-term (six weeks) preseason strength and jumping exercises distribution program on amateur adult soccer player’s indicators of physical fitness. Twenty male athletes (age 20.1±1.6 years) were randomly divided into two groups that completed a volume-equated training program differing only in exercises distribution: a group that completed three weeks of strength followed by three weeks of plyometric training (TT; n=10) and a group that completed six weeks of combined strength and plyometric drills (S+P; n=10). Athletes completed a triple hop test with the dominant (HOPd) and non-dominant leg (HOPnd), a 15 meters sprint, a change of direction speed (CODS) test (i.e. T test), and a 6×30 meters repeated sprint with change of direction for the best (RSCODb) and mean velocity (RSCODm), and the percentage of decrement (%Dec) in sprint time. Moreover, athletes performed a squat test for maximal power. Both strength and jumping training programs were performed two times per week, equated for exercises, frequency, volume, and intensity per session. The TT group completed the strength training volume during the first three weeks, and the plyometric training volume in the last three weeks, while the S+P combined strength and plyometric training during the six weeks. A 2 (group) × 2 (time: pre, post) ANOVA with repeated measures was used for statistical analysis. Analyses revealed significant improvements for the TT and S+P (HOPd: ES=0.91, 10.28 and 16.69%, respectively; HOPnd: ES=0.86, 11.49 and 14.71%, respectively; RSCODb: ES=0.84, 9.23 and 8.34%, respectively; RSCODm: ES=0.89, 8.56 and 7.51%, respectively). In the post-test there were no significant differences between the groups in any variable analyzed. In conclusion, both training approaches were equally effective at improving jumping and repeated sprinting ability. However, only after the S+P training approach a significant improvement in CODS was observed, with more substantial changes in maximal sprinting speed.","This study investigates the impact of two different distributions of a six-week strength and jumping exercise program on the physical fitness of amateur soccer players. It finds that while both training approaches equally enhanced jumping and repeated sprinting abilities, the combined strength and plyometric approach led to significant improvements in change of direction speed and maximal sprinting speed."
Interlimb asymmetry in collegiate American football players: Effects on combine-related performance,2021-01-01,,,,"The assessment of interlimb asymmetry has been of interest to researchers and practitioners who desire to maximize sport performance.The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between interlimb asymmetry and Combine-related performance testing in collegiate American football players.Twenty-four skill position players (e.g., running backs, defensive backs, and wide receivers) from a Division II university completed all study-related procedures including unilateral countermovement (CMJ) and drop jumps on a force plate, 3-repetition maximum Bulgarian split squats with bar movement tracked by a 3D motion capture system, and their annual spring performance tests (L-drill, pro-agility, 40-yard dash, broad jump, and vertical jump).Using an alpha-level of .05,significant, positive Spearman's correlations between performance in the L-drill test (Change of Direction test; CoD) and asymmetries in mean peak velocity (rs = .491,p = .015),mean peak power (rs = .467,p = .021),and mean average power (rs = .455,p = .026)were observed.A significant, negative Pearson correlation between unilateral CMJ height asymmetry and vertical jump performance was observed (r = .578,p = .003).Asymmetry in mean peak velocity, mean peak power, and mean average power may negatively influence CoD ability within collegiate American football players.","This study investigates the impact of interlimb asymmetry on performance in collegiate American football players, specifically analyzing its relationship with Combine-related performance testing.

A cadaveric study on the rate of strain-dependent behavior of human anterior cruciate ligament,2021-01-01,,,,"Purpose: Failure of anterior cruciate ligament often occurs in young sports personnel hampering their career. Such ACL ruptures are quite prevalent in sports such as soccer during dynamic loading which occurs at more than one rate of loading. In this work, a structural constitutive equation has been used to predict the forces acting on ACL for different rates of loading. Methods: Ligaments with distal femur and proximal tibia were subjected to tensile loading to avoid crushing of tissue ends and slipping at higher rates of strain. Custom designed cylindrical grippers were fabricated to clamp the distal femur and proximal tibial bony sections. To estimate parameters for the model, eighteen fresh cadaveric femur-ACL-tibia complex (FATC) samples were experimented on by pure tensile loading at three orders of rates of strain viz., 0.003, 0.03, and 0.3 s –1 . The experimental force-elongation data was used to obtain parameters for De-Vita and Slaughter’s equation. The model was validated with additional tensile experiments. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated failure stress, Young’s modulus and volumetric strain energy to vary significantly as a function of rate of strain. Midsection failure was observed only in samples tested at 0.03 s–1. Femoral or tibial insertion failure were observed in all other experiments irrespective of rate of strain. Conclusion: Human FATC samples were tensile tested to failure at three rates of strain using custom-designed cylindrical grippers. A structural model was used to model the data for the ACL behaviour in the linear region of loading to predict ligament behaviour during dynamic activities in live subjects.","This study investigates the strain-dependent behavior of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) through a cadaveric analysis, focusing on how different rates of loading affect ACL failure. The research employs a structural constitutive model to predict ACL forces during dynamic activities, with experimental results indicating significant variations in failure stress and other mechanical properties as a function of strain rate."
Biomechanical Differences between Successful and Unsuccessful Kicking Pullovers by 10-year-old Children,2021-01-01,,,,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the differences between successful and unsuccessful kicking pullovers in elementary school children. Successful (n = 12) and unsuccessful (n = 13) kicking pullovers by elementary school children having an approximate age of 10 years using 1 m high horizontal bars were captured, and sagittal plane analyses at 60 Hz were performed using a rigid body link model. The shoulder joint angles were kept constant in the successful movements, whereas those were steadily flexed in the unsuccessful movements after the take-off. The successful movements had smaller forward velocity of the center of mass (CoM) at takeoff, because of the larger decrease in the forward velocity during the takeoff phase. The angle of the swing leg thigh during the takeoff phase was highly correlated with this change in velocity. In successful movements, the thigh was more downward at touchdown, with the trunk upright and the hip joint of the swing leg largely extended. These results suggest that the downward swing leg in the successful movements allowed for larger and faster swinging during the takeoff phase, resulting in a larger backward reaction force impulse from the ground and decrease in the forward velocity of the CoM. This decreased velocity helps to pull the body towards the bar with upper limb joint torques after the takeoff. Therefore, guiding children to touch down in a posture with the trunk upright and the hip joint of the swing leg fully extended would be effective.","This study investigates the biomechanical differences in kicking pullovers between successful and unsuccessful attempts by 10-year-old children. Key findings indicate that successful movements maintain constant shoulder angles and exhibit a favorable leg position during takeoff, resulting in optimal swing dynamics and reduced forward velocity that aid in effectively pulling the body towards the bar."
Small-side games and size pitch in elite female soccer players: A short narrative review,2021-01-01,,,,"Introduction: In recent years, in the soccer training have found widespread diffusion the games modified by rules, use of wildcard players, configuration field, players' number, size of the playing area, defined as smallsided games or SSG.Methodology: For the bibliographic search PubMed and Sport Discuss databases were used selecting articles published between 01/01/2016 and 01/12/2020.Two keyword groups were identified, using synonyms and similar terms, using the operator ""OR"":1) ""small-sided games"" OR ""elite female soccer players"" OR ""field size"" 2) ""small-sided games"" OR ""elite female football players"" OR ""field size"".Subsequently, all the categories were combined together using the ""AND"" operator.Results: The initial database search produced 77 results.After removing the duplicates (3), study on injury incidence (21), amateur soccer players (3), endocrine and biomechanical aspects (20), assessment preventive issue (12) and other aspects not related to performances (15), three studies were selected, analysed, and included in the narrative review.Discussion and conclusions: The physiological responses of female soccer players during SSGs have only been investigated relative to the players' number.The field size is considered a key factor in soccer training because the players' density conditions internal and external load.The studies analysed suggest that the most suitable format for achieving a high intensity of exercise with female soccer players, is precisely the medium filed size, that is, in the case observed for 4vs4, a size equal to 24.5m x 24.5m.The load control of specific sport exercises is useful for the injury's prevention and for relevant training organization to respond to the competitions' demands.","This paper reviews the impact of small-sided games (SSGs) and pitch size on elite female soccer players, emphasizing the importance of field size in influencing players' physiological responses and exercise intensity.

The role of pre-season health characteristics as injury risk factors in female adolescent soccer players,2021-01-01,,,,"[Purpose] Determine if female adolescent soccer players with a history of concussion, impaired K-D scores, and pre-season subjective complaints of neck pain, dizziness, and headache were predisposed to additional risk of musculoskeletal or concussive injury during 10-weeks of competitive play. [Participants and Methods] Twenty-three female high school soccer athletes provided concussion history and reported pre-season subjective complaints. K-D testing was performed pre and postseason. During the 10-week season, all injuries, preventing participation in practice or game, were recorded. [Results] Six reported a history of concussion. Of those six, three injuries were reported, including two concussions and a hamstring strain. Baseline K-D scores were worse in athletes that had two or more pre-season subjective factors compared to those that did not have any. Moderate positive correlations were found between a history of concussion and the number of injuries and a history of concussion and K-D post-test scores. [Conclusion] Findings indicate that pre-season subjective factors of neck pain, dizziness and headache, history of concussion, and K-D potentially increased injury risk. Combining pre-season metrics both at baseline and during the course of the season may assist in better injury risk screening in-season or indicate suboptimal function due to cumulative effects.","This paper investigates the relationship between pre-season health characteristics—specifically concussion history, K-D scores, and subjective complaints like neck pain and dizziness—and their impact on injury risk in female adolescent soccer players during a competitive season. The study finds that athletes with multiple pre-season complaints and a history of concussion have worse K-D scores and a higher likelihood of sustaining injuries, suggesting the importance of incorporating these metrics for injury risk screening."
Validity of an Inertial Measurement Unit System to Assess Lower-limb Kinematics during a Maximal Linear Deceleration,2021-01-01,,,,"This study examined the validity of an inertial measurement unit system for measuring lower-limb joint kinematics during linear decelerations. A male team athlete (age 36 years, stature 1.75 m, mass 80.0 kg) performed multiple linear decelerations, following 20 m runs at 50%, 75% and 100% self-perceived effort. Inertial measurement unit sensors were strapped to lower-limb segments and retroreflective markers were adhered to the lower-limbs for 3D optical motion analysis. Ground contact time, foot to centre of mass displacement (foot-COM), peak and minimum angle, mean angular velocity and range of motion at the ankle, knee and hip during the contact phases of each deceleration were determined. Measures were valid if a very large correlation (r ≥ 0.7) and small bias (effect size < 0.6) were evident. Following 50% effort, ground contact time, foot-COM and most hip and knee kinematics were valid. Ground contact time, foot-COM and knee flexion velocity and range of motion were valid following 75% efforts. Ground contact time and knee flexion velocity were valid following 100% effort. Therefore, the inertial measurement unit system tested can be used to assess temporal-spatial parameters during a deceleration regardless of the preceding effort, and hip and knee kinematics following low intensity running.","This study investigates the validity of an inertial measurement unit system for assessing lower-limb joint kinematics during linear deceleration in team athletes. The results indicate strong correlations and small biases in measurements of ground contact time, foot-COM displacement, and knee flexion across varying effort levels, supporting the system's effectiveness for analyzing kinematics in deceleration scenarios."

The impact of the foot contact position and cutting angle during cutting on the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury,2021-01-01,,,,"[Purpose] This study aimed to clarify the impact of the foot contact position and cutting angle on the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury during cutting. [Participants and Methods] Seven healthy males performed cuttings under four tasks by changing the foot contact position and cutting angle. A three-dimensional motion analysis system and force plates were used for taking measurements. The peak vertical ground reaction force and loading rate were calculated. The pelvic, hip, and knee joint angles were measured at the peak vertical ground reaction force. [Results] The loading rate was significantly higher in the lateral foot contact than in the anterior foot contact when the cutting angle was large. The knee flexion angle at the peak vertical ground reaction force was significantly smaller in the lateral foot contact than in the anterior foot contact when the cutting angle was large, similar to the pelvic forward inclination angle, regardless of the foot contact position. [Conclusion] As the cutting angle increased, the knee flexion and pelvic forward inclination angles decreased, resulting in an increase in the loading rate during cutting with the lateral foot contact. Therefore, an increase in the cutting angle can increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury.","This study examines how foot contact position and cutting angle influence the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries during cutting maneuvers. The findings indicate that a lateral foot contact position at larger cutting angles significantly raises the loading rate and alters knee joint dynamics, heightening ACL injury risk."

"Peak Speeds of Professional Football Players During Bouts of Non-curved, Manual Treadmill Sprints",2021-01-01,,,,"Purpose: Speed training and short distance sprints have become an essential component of preparation for professional football players. Current trends in speed training have included the application of non-curved, manual treadmills, as they may enhance peak speeds with less biomechanical stress. A lack of data currently exists in regards to the effectiveness of different settings and peak speed response. Therefore, we proposed to compare peak speeds during different settings of non-curved, manual treadmills. It was hypothesized that as resistance/incline increased, peak sprinting speeds would decrease and vice versa. Methods: Fourteen male professional football players (27.14 ± 3.11 yrs., 183.93 ± 8.52 cm, 100.36 ± 15.60 kg) sprinted at peak speeds during four different incline/resistance bouts. Paired samples T-tests examined differences between bouts, and significance was set at p ≤ 0.008. Results: A significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) existed for peak speeds between each incline/resistance bout (i.e. INC15R8, INC15R5, INC20R3, INC20R1). Conclusions: The observed data differences existed between all bouts, indicating that as resistance and/or incline increased, peak speed decreased. This also indicated that as resistance and/or incline decreased, peak speed increased during sprint bouts in professional football players.","This paper investigates the impact of different incline and resistance settings on the peak sprinting speeds of professional football players using non-curved, manual treadmills. The results indicate that increasing resistance and incline negatively affects peak speed, while decreasing these factors enhances sprint performance."

Disordered Eating in Collegiate Athletes,2019-12-30,,,,"Performance pressures and emphasis on body weight and shape put collegiate athletes at risk for disordered eating. If not identified early, disordered eating behaviors could develop into a clinical eating disorder. While such behaviors are a known problem, prevalence rates are not well established in collegiate athletes. Disordered eating may also relate to physiological changes in athletes, such as body composition and performance, although this relationship is not well understood. The aims of this research were to 1) determine the prevalence of disordered eating risk in NCAA Division I student-athletes and 2) determine if such behaviors are related to baseline and changes in body composition over a competitive season. Athletes (n=58) competing in eight different sports (football, men’s and women’s soccer, women’s basketball, gymnastics, men’s and women’s track and field, and women’s diving), from an urban university, completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) questionnaire and two dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body composition scans, one at preseason and another at postseason. While no risk for disordered eating was found in this sample, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was positively correlated with EAT-26 scores (r=0.661, p=0.038) among female gymnasts. Reasons for these findings are unclear; however, it is thought that the ethnic diversity of the sample played a role in the absence of disordered eating risk in this study. Further research is needed to better understand if ethnicity plays a role in disordered eating risk.","This paper investigates the prevalence and correlation of disordered eating behaviors among NCAA Division I student-athletes, focusing on the relationship between these behaviors and body composition across a competitive season. While the study found no significant risk for disordered eating in the sample, a notable positive correlation was observed between visceral adipose tissue and eating attitudes in female gymnasts, suggesting potential underlying factors, including ethnic diversity, warranting further exploration."
Ultrasound elastography as a potential method to evaluate entrapment neuropathies in elite athletes: a mini-review,2019-12-28,,,,"Entrapment neuropathies constitute a significant albeit still neglected problem in athletes. Currently available diagnostic options in patients with suspected neuropathies, nerve conduction studies, and magnetic resonance imaging have some drawbacks, mostly related to their invasive character, high cost, and limited availability. This paper reviews published articles documenting the use of ultrasound elastography, a novel technique to determine tissue strain, in the evaluation of nerve stiffness in entrapment neuropathy, and it discusses potential pros and cons of this method in the examination of elite athletes. Based on the review of literature, ultrasound elastography – especially shear wave elastography – seems suitable for the evaluation of entrapment neuropathies in elite athletes. Published evidence from the general population suggests that most common entrapment neuropathies (carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy of the elbow, ulnar tunnel syndrome) are associated with a significant increase in the stiffness of affected nerves, which can be accurately detected with ultrasound elastography. Before adding ultrasound elastography to the armamentarium of diagnostic tests used routinely in athletes, its accuracy in the detection of entrapment neuropathies needs to be verified in this specific group, and the reference values for peripheral nerve strain in sportspersons need to be determined.","This paper reviews the potential of ultrasound elastography, particularly shear wave elastography, as a diagnostic tool for evaluating entrapment neuropathies in elite athletes. It highlights the advantages of this non-invasive technique over traditional methods and emphasizes the need for further validation of its accuracy and establishment of reference values for this specific athlete population."
Rehabilitation of Lateral Ankle Sprains in Sports,2019-12-02,,,,"Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries in athletes. The rate of injury is as high as 70%. The most commonly involved ligament is the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), followed by the calcaneofibular (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL). The common mechanism of injury is inversion with excessive ankle supination in forced plantarflexion when the ankle joint is in its most unstable position. There are three grades of ankle sprains: Grade I, mild with an incomplete tear of ATFL; Grade II, moderate with a complete tear of ATFL with or without an incomplete tear of CFL; and Grade III, severe with complete tear of ATFL and CFL. Grades I and II respond well to functional treatment. Functional treatment includes RICE protocol, i.e., rest, ice, compression, and elevation. It also includes range of motion and strengthening exercises, proprioceptive training, and sports-specific exercises. Bracing and taping of the ankle joint help in preventing the sprains and also reduce the recurrence of the injury. Grade III ankle injury may be treated with surgery if the symptoms persist post functional treatment. The guidelines provided for the treatment of ankle sprains are of general validity, but each athlete is different with different needs. Hence, a personalized exercise protocol should be followed to achieve best results.","This paper discusses the prevalence and treatment of lateral ankle sprains in athletes, highlighting the mechanisms of injury and the classification of sprains into three grades. It emphasizes the effectiveness of functional treatment methods, including the RICE protocol, bracing, and tailored exercise programs for optimal recovery and prevention of recurrence."
HUMAN FACTORS AT WORK: OWAS APPLICATION FOR IDENTIFICATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS IN A MAINTENANCE ASSISTANT,2019-11-18,,,,"The activities of maintenance and cleaning of swimming pools require several efforts and postures that could cause discomfort and injuries. In this way, this research aimed to identify, applying the OWAS method, the musculoskeletal disorders that affect these workers. The results obtained have made it possible to identify the risks and consequently actions to reduce or eliminate them. The most critical posture identified was the kneeling pose when he is brushing the sides of the swimming pool. To eliminate this posture, it is proposed to change a manual brush to a brush with telescopic stick, designed with an angle that allows the worker to stand upright without flexed his trunk while cleaning the pool. This change improves the working conditions, providing well-being and reducing as negative consequences.","This paper examines the identification of musculoskeletal disorders among maintenance assistants in swimming pool environments using the OWAS method.

How to Evaluate and Improve Foot Strength in Athletes: An Update,2019-10-11,,,,"The foot is a complex system with multiple degrees of freedom that play an essential role in running or sprinting. The intrinsic foot muscles (IFM) are the main local stabilizers of the foot and are part of the active and neural subsystems that constitute the foot core. These muscles lengthen eccentrically during the stance phase of running before shortening at the propulsion phase, as the arch recoils in parallel to the plantar fascia. They play a key role in supporting the medial longitudinal arch, providing flexibility, stability and shock absorption to the foot, whilst partially controlling pronation. Much of the foot rigidity in late stance has been attributed to the windlass mechanism - the dorsiflexion of the toes building tension up in the plantar aponeurosis and stiffening the foot. In addition, recent studies have shown that the IFM provide a necessary active contribution in late stance, in order to develop sufficient impedance in the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. This in turn facilitates the propulsive forces at push-off. These factors support the critical role of the foot in providing rigidity and an efficient lever at push-off. During sprinting, athletes need to generate and maintain the highest (linear) running velocity during a single effort in a sprinting lane. Acceleration and sprinting performance requires forces to be transmitted efficiently to the ground. It may be of particular interest to strengthen foot muscles to maintain and improve an optimal capacity to generate and absorb these forces. The current evidence supports multiple exercises to achieve higher strength in the foot, such as the ""short foot exercise"", toes curl, toes extension or even minimalist running. Their real impact on foot muscle strength remains unclear and data related to its assessment remains scarce, despite a recognized need for this, especially before and after a strengthening intervention. It would be optimal to be able to assess it. In this article, we aim to provide the track and field community with an updated review on the current modalities available for foot strength assessment and training. We present recommendations for the incorporation of foot muscles training for performance and injury prevention.","This paper reviews the importance of foot strength in athletes, particularly in relation to running and sprinting performance. It discusses the role of intrinsic foot muscles in stabilizing the foot, their impact on propulsion, and provides recommendations for training and assessing foot muscle strength to enhance athletic performance and prevent injuries."
A Comparison of Football and Rugby Tackling During Spring Ball,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The study examined the effects tackling style has on forces translated to the brain in football and rugby. <h3>Background</h3> Tackling is linked to concussion due to high or repetitive impact forces. A small number of NFL teams are incorporating the rugby tackle mechanics due to keeping the head out of the way. Rugby style tackle use is increasing in football. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A convenient sample of 30 male football and rugby participants from two universities participated in this observational study. 20 football participants (20 ± 1.61 YO, 71.63 ± 2.71 in, 210.84 ± 45.52 lbs.) had impact sensors placed in the helmet (CUE™ Sports Sensor, Athlete Intelligence, Kirkland, WA) and 10 rugby participants (20.22 ± 3.31 YO, 70.78 ± 2.11 in, 211.78 ± 40.62 lbs.) were fitted with an instrumented mouthguard (VECTOR™ Sports Sensor, Athlete Intelligence, Kirkland, WA) during their respective spring seasons. Participants practiced without intervention. Devices were returned to researchers after activity, and the data was uploaded. Welch's ANOVA with a Games-Howell post-hoc analyzed the data with significance set at 0.05. <h3>Results</h3> Football participants tallied 3921 impacts over the course of 12 practices, compared to 1868 impacts over 9 practices received by rugby participants. Welch's ANOVA determined that there is a difference in the frequency of impacts between football and rugby participants (<i>Welch's F</i> (1, 4119.84) = 29.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Football participants encountered linear impacts at 62.95 ± 36.57g. Rugby participants sustained impacts 20.59 ± 15.79g.

Reduced cognitive resiliency ofattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder against subconcussive head impacts,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this study was to determine the subconcussive head impacts (SHI) effects on neurocognitive function in individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). <h3>Background</h3> Athletes diagnosed with ADHD have a heightened risk (2 to 4-fold) for sustaining concussion. However, their response to repetitive SHI remain unclear. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> In this case-control intervention study, 17 soccer players clinically diagnosed with ADHD who take their prescribed medication daily, were assigned a heading intervention (ADHD-Heading group),individuals who met the ADHD criteria but were non-soccer players, were assigned into a kicking group, (ADHD-Kicking group, n = 15). Whereas 34 soccer players without ADHD diagnosis were randomized into either a heading or kicking intervention, yielding Non-ADHD-Heading group (n = 17) or Non-ADHD-Kicking group (n = 17). To implement SHI, the heading groups executed 10 headers with a standard soccer ball projected at a velocity of 25 mph (equivalent to a long throw-in) over 10 minutes by a JUGS soccer machine, while the kicking groups performed 10 kicks. Neurocognitive function was measured via the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) at pre-intervention baseline, 0h, 2h, and 24h post-intervention. <h3>Results</h3> The vulnerability to SHI was notable in subjects diagnosed with ADHD particularly in memory, as illustrated by a significant group × time interaction, F(6,96) = 3.796, <i>p</i> = 0.002. Both Kicking groups improved verbal memory over time indicating the brain's ability to learn, whereas the Non-ADHD-Heading group showed no improvement. The ADHD-Heading group showed a significant decline at 0h and 2h post-heading compared to other groups. As for visual memory, the ADHD-Heading group showed a significant decline at 24h post; however, all other groups displayed improvement. There were no group differences in remaining domains. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Data suggests neurocognitive vulnerability in athletes diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing SHI, specifically in memory performance. These outcomes can better inform clinicians; overall, promoting a better personalized care in athletes diagnosed with ADHD.","This study investigates the effects of subconcussive head impacts (SHI) on neurocognitive function in athletes diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to non-ADHD athletes.

Association of physiological variables with subconcussive head impacts in high school American football,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationships between subconcussive head impact frequency and magnitude and measures of physical exertion and muscle damage. <h3>Background</h3> Subconcussive head impacts, or impacts that do not present with concussion symptoms, are gaining traction as a major public health concern. However, there is a gap in knowledge about the contribution of physiological variables, such as muscle damage and physical exertion, to neurological measures used to assess subconcussive impact-dependent changes. The unknown contribution of physical exertion and strenuous exercise is often listed as a limitation in field studies of subconcussive head impacts. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Fifteen high school football players wore mouthguards installed with triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes in order to quantify the linear and rotational accelerations of every head impact sustained throughout one season (practices and games). Additionally, serum samples were collected at twelve time points (pre-season, pre- and post-competition for five in-season games, and post-season) and assayed for CK-MM, the skeletal muscle-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase. Subjects wore heart rate monitors during the five games, and heart rate data were used to estimate physical exertion in terms of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). <h3>Results</h3> Mixed-effect regression modeling (MRM) showed significant and positive associations between CK-MM and subconcussive head impact kinematic variables, in addition to a significant and positive association between CK-MM and EPOC. The models were adjusted for cumulative head impact exposures up to each game and the pre-season serum CK-MM levels, when applicable. <h3>Conclusions</h3> When investigating subconcussive head impacts, the effects of muscle damage should be considered when using correlated outcome measures, such as inflammatory biomarkers and vestibular assessments.","This paper investigates the relationship between subconcussive head impacts in high school American football players and physiological variables such as muscle damage and physical exertion. It finds significant positive associations between the levels of muscle damage, indicated by CK-MM, and head impact kinematic variables, as well as physical exertion, suggesting that muscle damage should be considered in assessments of subconcussive impacts."

Participants experienced a visual stimulus at 0.2 Hz, a ±1 mA binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulus (GVS) at 0.36 Hz, and a vibratory stimulus to their bilateral Achilles tendons at 0.28 Hz during standing. The visual stimulus was presented at different amplitudes (0.2, 0.8 m translation in the anterior-posterior direction) to measure the change in leg gain to vision, gain to vibration, and gain to GVS. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare sensory reweighting between groups. <h3>Results</h3> There were group differences in sensory reweighting for leg gain to GVS (i.e. condition X group effect; F<sub>3,54</sub> = 5.068, <i>p</i> = 0.004, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.220), whereby the high-RHI group did not reweight gain to GVS across conditions, and gain to vision (F<sub>3,54</sub> = 3.397, <i>p</i> = 0.024, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.159), whereby the high-RHI group had higher gains than the low-RHI group in the 0.2 m visual stimulus condition. There were no group differences in sensory reweighting for gain to vibration (F<sub>1,18</sub> = 0.045, <i>p</i> = 0.834, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.003). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Routine soccer heading is associated with relatively high head accelerations. These results suggest that exposure to frequent RHI may induce adaptation that diminishes reliance on vestibular function. Consequently, visual feedback is upweighted to maintain balance during upright stance.","This paper investigates the differences in sensory reweighting between soccer players with varying levels of exposure to repetitive head impacts from heading the ball. Results indicate that players with higher exposure exhibit altered sensory reweighting, relying more on visual stimuli and less on vestibular function for maintaining balance."
Concussion-like symptoms Induced by Heat and Dehydration in a Varsity College Soccer Player: A Case Report,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> Show light on confounding presentations of heat and environmental related illnesses &amp; mild TBI symptomatology. Identify overlapping symptomatology of heat illness &amp; mild TBI. <h3>Background</h3> Heat illnesses, mostly heat exhaustion, tends to go under reported and many times, due to the nature of the activity, may be confused with a concussion despite the individual not experiencing any identifiable concussive event. Heat related illnesses are caused when the body is unable to regulate the cooling of itself. Normal physiological mechanisms such as sweating may not be sufficient to respond to the severe increase and change in temperature. As a result, the body temperature will raise to dangerous levels and cause damage to vital organs, including the brain. Today, there is very limited literature available that compares the symptoms of concussion vs heat illnesses. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Case obtained from a Barrow Neurological Institute Concussion and Brain Injury patient. Case will reported from available history and clinic follow up visit. Overlapping symptoms of heat and concussion will demostrated in table format. No HIPPA information will be disclosed. <h3>Results</h3> The Soccer player was prevented from play due to a ""Concussion"" according to the Athletic trainer. No identifiable event was reported. Patient did experience Migranious headaches that were triggered by dehydration and execisseve heat exposure. <h3>Conclusions</h3> There is a significant overlap in concussion and heat related symptoms. Family history of migraines is a predisposing factor for both concussion and heat illness. Heat illness is noticeable underreported and may be confused as a concussion in high impact /collision activities; which, provides a challenge in itself due to nature of sports and exercise. Education about heat illness is important. More research is require to determine how much these two process overlap in symptomatology, are confounded &amp; misdiagnosed, and occur concomitantly.","The paper examines the overlapping symptoms of heat-related illnesses and mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in a college soccer player, highlighting the challenges of misdiagnosing heat exhaustion as a concussion. It emphasizes the need for increased awareness and research into the symptomatology overlap and the importance of educating athletes and staff about heat illnesses."
Does the Concussion Clinican Examination Predict Post-Concussion Subsequent Musculoskeletal Injury?,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> To identify post-concussion subsequent lower extermity musculoskeletal injury predictors from a clinical concussion assessment. <h3>Background</h3> Emerging evidence has identified an elevated risk of subsequent lower extremity musculoskeletal injury (LE-MSK) in the year post-concussion. This approximately 2-fold elevated risk has been identified in diverse populations including high school, college, professional sports and military populations. While persistent impairments in postural control are a speculated mechanism, these assessments require instrumented biomechanical measures; thus, there are currently no clinically feasible predictors which have been identified. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Eighty three NCAA Division I student-athletes (51.8% female, ht: 1.75 +/− 0.12 m, wt: 76.2 +/− 20.1 kg) who had suffered a sports related concussion (LOC: 7.5%, PTA: 12.2%) with baseline data were assessed within 72 hours post-concussion were included in this retrospectic study. The clinical examination consisted of the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Clinical Reaction Time (CRT), King-Devick (KD) and the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitve Test (ImPACT) composite values. Change scores (Δ) from baseline to acute post-concussion served as predictors to identify subsequent LE-MSK with a step wise binary logistic regression. <h3>Results</h3> The subsequent LE-MSK rate was 72.3% (60/83). The overall model failed to identify a predictive relationship between change scores and subsequent injury risk (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.242, <i>p</i> = 0.458). Exploratory testing failed to identify any significant individual predictors of subsequent LE-MSK: BESS: Δ = −0.35 errs, <i>p</i> = 0.964; SAC: Δ = −0.55, <i>p</i> = 0.239; ImPACT Verbal Memory: Δ = −0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.324; ImPACT Visual Memory: Δ = −5.6, <i>p</i> = 0.750; ImPACT Motor Speed: Δ = −2.81, <i>p</i> = 0.070; ImPACT Reaction Time: Δ = 0.042 sec, <i>p</i> = 0.164; CRT: Δ = 12.2 ms, <i>p</i> = 0.564; and KD: Δ = 2.8 sec, <i>p</i> = 0.607. <h3>Conclusions</h3> None of the common clinical concussion assessments were a significant predictor of subsequent LE-MSK potentially due to a high injury rate (72.3%). Future research should continue attempts to idenify clinically feasible predictors to allow clinicians to identify at-risk athletes to engage injury prevention strategies to reduce subsequent LE-MSK.","The paper investigates the effectiveness of clinical concussion assessments in predicting subsequent lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries in NCAA Division I student-athletes post-concussion. Despite the elevated risk of such injuries being established, the study found that none of the examined clinical assessments significantly predicted subsequent lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries, highlighting a need for further research to identify effective predictors for injury prevention strategies."
Nonverbal hand movement durations indicate post-concussion symptoms of athletes,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> Concussions are common in sports and appear to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and mental health problems. Methods of post-concussion diagnosis are still of debate, regarding sensitivity, objectivity, reliability, and costs. Spontaneous displays of nonverbal hand movement behavior during interaction are indicative of psychopathology and relatively simple to record and analyze. <h3>Background</h3> Increased durations of continuous (/irregular) body-focused hand movement activity in particular indicates psychopathology that overlaps in symptomatology with that of sport related concussions (SRC). We therefore hypothesized that the duration of irregular, on body, and act on each other hand movements is increased in athletes with SRC who suffer from post-concussion symptoms. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Three matched groups were investigated: 14 symptomatic athletes with a concussion, 14 asymptomatic athletes with a concussion, and 12 non-concussed athletes. Four certified raters analyzed with the NEUROGES analysis system all nonverbal hand movements that were displayed during a videotaped standardized anamnesis about concussion history, incidence, course of action, and post-concussion symptoms. <h3>Results</h3> Irregular Structure units of symptomatic athletes are significantly longer when compared to asymptomatic athletes. Hand movement durations of irregular, on body, and act on each other correlate positively with post-concussion symptoms. The duration of irregular units significantly predicts the PCS score. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Increased durations of irregular hand movement units indicate post-concussion symptoms in athletes with sport-related concussions. Because the recording of spontaneous displays of nonverbal hand movement behavior is relatively simple and cost-efficient, we suggest using the neuropsychological analysis of hand movement behavior as a future diagnostic parameter of concussion management protocols.","This paper investigates the relationship between nonverbal hand movement durations and post-concussion symptoms in athletes. It finds that symptomatic athletes show longer durations of irregular hand movements, indicating that such behaviors could serve as simple and cost-effective diagnostic parameters in concussion management protocols."
An objective method to assess and recommend exertion and exercise targets for return to play post concussion,2019-10-01,,,,"<h3>Objective</h3> The object of this presentation is to supply the athletic trainer with data concerning a methodology that can be used to aid in designing a cardio conditioning regimen postconcussion as well as an exercise or lifting program postconcussion. This objective measure does not rely on subjective patient reports of symptoms and utilizes a reflex based assessment method. <h3>Background</h3> Sports concussion is a substantial concern for athletic trainers and there is a critical need to objectively and safely allow an athlete to return to play as soon as safely possible. Being able to make cogent recommendations as opposed to empirically trying something that has an intrinsic risk of eliciting symptoms or causing setbacks is urgently needed. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We present data concerning 65 athletes (mean age 20.8 years) who were assessed. This was done while on an exercise bike going through a progression of exertion levels. The TERC Murmur was listened for every 2 minutes at the traditional carotid artery position. <h3>Results</h3> Results for cardio assessment. 73% of the cardio assessment subjects had a TERC Murmur at a heart rate of 127.2 bpm (± 16 SD). The transient exertion related carotid (TERC) murmur is a murmur that is heard at the carotid arteries during exercise. It normally is heard at around a heart rate of 150, but is heard a lower heart rates in concussion patients. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The clinical advantages of the use of the TERC murmur is that it can be applied by an athletic trainer with the training to listen for a blood pressure. It provides objective information concerning safe heart rates and target heart rate. Being able to safely recommend a means by which an athlete can condition (cardio and or lifting) will accelerate return to play as well as aid in keeping the athlete happy, healthy and engaged.","This paper presents a methodology to assist athletic trainers in designing cardio conditioning and exercise programs for athletes recovering from concussions, relying on objective measures rather than subjective symptom reports. The study highlights the use of the transient exertion related carotid (TERC) murmur as a clinical indicator for safe heart rates during recovery, ultimately aiming to facilitate a timely and safe return to play for concussed athletes."
"Thoracic spine mobility, an essential link in upper limb kinetic chains in athletes: A systematic review",2019-09-23,,,,"Knowledge of the contribution of the thoracic spine movement, a requisite for UL functional movement, offers the potential for novel directions for research and management in rehabilitation. This systematic reviewed synthesized evidence of thoracic spine mobility during UL movement in athletes. Using three reviewers at each stage, key databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up to 30/6/18. Eligibility criteria: adults age 18-40 (reflecting athletic population) and studies assessing thoracic spine and UL movement. Quality assessment was evaluated using AXIS tool and GRADE for overall quality of evidence. Seven studies were included (n = 168, mean age 26.4 years, 33% males) with n = 20 in an athlete population. Main findings were: Unilateral and bilateral UL flexion resulted in 6.7-8.0 and 12.0-12.8° thoracic extension, respectively. Unilateral and bilateral UL abduction resulted in 3.0-4.0 and 9.0-15.0 and degrees, respectively. Other thoracic spine movement (lower and upper, rotation and lateral flexion) was variable across movement planes. Overall there was unequivocal evidence of thoracic spine movement, mainly extension during UL movement and notably at the end of elevation across all planes. Findings support further targeted high-quality research and examination of thoracic mobility, an essential link in the kinetic chain, in practice.","This systematic review investigates the role of thoracic spine mobility in upper limb (UL) movements among athletes, highlighting its significance in functional movement and rehabilitation. The findings indicate specific degrees of thoracic extension during unilateral and bilateral UL flexion and abduction, stressing the need for further research on thoracic mobility as a critical component of the kinetic chain."
Post-activation potentiation effect of eccentric overload and traditional weightlifting exercise on jumping and sprinting performance in male athletes,2019-09-12,,,,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the post-activation potentiation (PAP) effects following eccentric overload (EOL) and traditional weightlifting (TW) exercise on standing long jump (SLJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and 5 m sprint acceleration performance. Ten male athletes were involved in a randomized, crossover study. The subjects performed 3 sets of 6 repetitions of EOL or TW half squat exercise followed by SLJ, CMJ, and 5 m sprint tests at 1 min, 3 min and 7 min, in separate sessions using a randomized order. Bayes factor (BF10) was reported to show the strength of the evidence. Differences were found using EOL for SLJ distance at 3 min (BF10 = 7.24, +8%), and 7 min (BF10 = 19.5, +7%), for CMJ at 3 min (BF10 = 3.25, +9%), and 7 min (BF10 = 4.12, +10.5%). Differences were found using TW exercise for SLJ at 3 min (BF10 = 3.88, +9%), and 7 min (BF10 = 12.4, +9%), CMJ at 3 min (BF10 = 7.42, +9.5%), and 7 min (BF10 = 12.4, +12%). No meaningful differences were found between EOL and TW exercises for SLJ (BF10 = 0.33), CMJ (BF10 = 0.27), and 5 m sprint (BF10 = 0.22). In conclusion, EOL and TW exercises acutely increase SLJ and CMJ, but not 5 m sprint performance. The PAP time window was found between 3 min and 7 min using both protocols. This study did not find differences between EOL and TW exercises, and so both methodologies can be used to stimulate a PAP response.","This study investigates the post-activation potentiation (PAP) effects of eccentric overload (EOL) and traditional weightlifting (TW) exercises on jump and sprint performance in male athletes. Results indicate that both EOL and TW exercises enhance standing long jump and countermovement jump performance at specific time intervals post-exercise, but no significant differences were found between the two methods, suggesting either can effectively elicit a PAP response."
Multiple Concussions Increase Odds and Rate of Lower Extremity Injury in National Collegiate Athletic Association Athletes After Return to Play,2019-09-12,,,,"Background: Concussion in collegiate athletics is one of the most prevalent sport-related injuries in the United States, with recent studies suggesting persistent deficits in neuromuscular control after a concussion and an associated increase in risk of lower extremity injury. Purpose: To expand on the relationship between concussion and lower extremity injury by examining the effect of multiple concussions (MC) on rate and odds of future lower extremity injury in collegiate athletes after return to play (RTP) compared with matched controls. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: From 2001 to 2016, 48 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes sustaining multiple concussions at a single institution were identified. Athletes with multiple concussions (MC) were matched directly to athletes with a single concussion (SC) and to athletes with no concussion history (NC) by sex, sport, position, and games played. Incidence of, time to, and location of lower extremity injury were recorded for each group after RTP from their first reported concussion until completion of their collegiate career. Logistic regression was used to analyze odds ratios (ORs) for sustaining lower extremity injury, whereas time to injury was summarized by use of Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test analysis. Results: The incidence of lower extremity injury after RTP was significantly greater ( P = .049) in the MC cohort (36/48, 75%) than in SC athletes (25/48 = 52%) and NC athletes (27/48 = 56%). Similarly, odds of lower extremity injury were significantly greater in the MC cohort than in SC athletes (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.26-7.12; P = .01) and NC athletes (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07-2.56; P = .02). Time to lower extremity injury was significantly shorter in the MC group compared with matched controls ( P = .01). No difference was found in odds of lower extremity injury or time to lower extremity injury between SC and NC athletes. Conclusion: Collegiate athletes with MC were more likely to sustain a lower extremity injury after RTP in a shorter time frame than were the matched SC and NC athletes. This may suggest the presence of a cohort more susceptible to neuromuscular deficits after concussion or more injury prone due to player behavior, and it may imply the need for more stringent RTP protocols for athletes experiencing MC.","The paper investigates the relationship between multiple concussions and the increased incidence and odds of lower extremity injuries in collegiate athletes after returning to play. Findings indicate that athletes with multiple concussions are significantly more likely to sustain lower extremity injuries and do so in a shorter timeframe compared to those with a single concussion or no concussion history, suggesting a need for revised return-to-play protocols."
High-Intensity Acceleration and Deceleration Demands in Elite Team Sports Competitive Match Play: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies,2019-09-10,,,,"The external movement loads imposed on players during competitive team sports are commonly measured using global positioning system devices. Information gleaned from analyses is employed to calibrate physical conditioning and injury prevention strategies with the external loads imposed during match play. Intense accelerations and decelerations are considered particularly important indicators of external load. However, to date, no prior meta-analysis has compared high and very high intensity acceleration and deceleration demands in elite team sports during competitive match play.","This paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies focusing on the high-intensity acceleration and deceleration demands placed on players in elite team sports during competitive match play. The research highlights the significance of these intense movements as indicators of external load, which are crucial for informing physical conditioning and injury prevention strategies."
Evaluation of Adjustable Loop Suspensory Anterior Cruciate Ligament Fixation Devices,2019-09-01,,,,"Abstract Along with increasing enthusiasm for sports comes an increase of sport related injuries. One of the most common injuries in the human knee is the tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The selection of a graft fixation device is an important factor that determines the outcome of an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Before the healing process is completed, the graft is dependent on tibial and femoral fixation devices to maintain normal ACL graft tension. Among various devices, the use of an adjustable loop suspensory fixation device (ALD) in soft-tissue graft reconstruction attracts current interest. An advantage of the ALD is the ability to draw the graft to the depth of the bone tunnel to achieve adequate graft tension while minimizing the empty space in the tunnel. In this study a comprehensive controlled laboratory investigation is performed to examine the biomechanical properties of commonly used cortical fixation devices, with the aim of implementing a standard testing procedure for adjustable loop devices. The procedure consists of three test series, a loop shortening test and two different stability test series (singe device and tendon device test). Those test series are used to compare the performance of a new ALD from Arthrex (Naples, USA) with five competitor devices already on the market. In order to obtain representative results eight samples of each device are tested. In comparison to the previously performed studies, a complete unloading is applied in the stability tests, which allows for a detailed examination of the ALDs locking mechanisms in dynamically loaded test situations. Furthermore, the performed loop shortening tests reveal important aspects, such as the shortening accuracy and settling effects of the loops, that are not found in previous studies. Therefore, the used test protocol can be recommended for further testing.","The paper investigates the biomechanical properties of adjustable loop suspensory fixation devices (ALD) used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, emphasizing their ability to maintain graft tension during the healing process. A comprehensive controlled laboratory study compares a new ALD from Arthrex with five existing devices, using a standardized testing protocol to evaluate the devices’ stability and performance under dynamic loads."

"Comparison of Peak Ground Reaction Force, Joint Kinetics and Kinematics, and Muscle Activity Between a Flexible and Steel Barbell During the Back Squat Exercise",2019-08-21,,,,"The flexible barbell is purported to improve training gains compared with an Olympic steel barbell (SB) during the back squat exercise with Division I collegiate American football programs. The two bars loaded at 30% 1-repetition maximum were compared with ten trained Division I American football players (n = 10; age = 19.5 years; body mass = 89.4 kg; body height = 182.0 cm) completing 10 repetitions of the back squat exercise. Analysis included integrated-peak values of electromyography of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, rectus abdominis, erector spinae, external oblique, vastus lateralis, ground reaction forces, and joint kinematics and kinetics of the hip, knee, and ankle. The flexible bar elicited significant increases in peak joint kinetics (Hip Moment: 229 ± 54 Nm vs. 209 ± 52 Nm; Hip Power: 494 ± 151 W vs. 382 ± 134 W; Knee Power: 305 ± 108 W vs. 241 ± 63 W), peak vertical ground reaction forces (1195 ± 209 N vs. 1120 ± 203 N), and muscle activity (Vastus Lateralis: 75.7 vs. 66.5%, Rectus Abdominis: 190 vs. 115%, Rectus Femoris: 69.8 vs. 59.9%, External Oblique: 115 vs. 69.0%). Greater vertical ground reaction forces, hip moment, hip power, knee power, and muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, and external oblique suggest the FB provides biomechanical and physiological mechanisms for training gains over the SB for 30% of 1-repetition maximum loads.","This paper investigates the differences in peak ground reaction force, joint kinetics, kinematics, and muscle activity between a flexible barbell and a steel barbell during the back squat exercise in trained Division I American football players. The findings indicate that the flexible barbell leads to significantly greater peak joint kinetics, peak vertical ground reaction forces, and muscle activity, suggesting its potential benefits for enhancing training outcomes compared to the steel barbell at 30% of 1-repetition maximum loads."
Design of Ergonomic Assault Vest for Indonesian Army with Modular Concept,2019-08-01,,,,"Abstract Assault vest is one of crucial products for Indonesian army infantry soldiers to support their activities in the battlefield. Despite its importance, however, the design of the assault vest of Indonesian army was not considered Ergonomics aspects. Based on the deep interview and questionnaries distributed to 30 Indonesian Army infantry soldiers, the current design was not really comfortable and limit the freedom of movement in the battlefield. Because of this, this research aims to design a modular assault vest for Indonesian army infantry that considering Ergonomics aspects. The object of this study was the 411 Infantry Batalyon / Pandawa located in Salatiga City, Central Java Province, with a total sample of 30 active infantry soldiers involve in this study.

Performance-based outcomes following patellar tendon repair in professional athletes,2019-07-10,,,,"Objectives: There are limited data on the impact of a patellar tendon repair to a professional athlete's career. The purpose of this study was to determine differences return to play (RTP) rate, career length, and performance-based outcomes after a patellar tendon repair in professional athletes of four different sports.Methods: Participants met inclusion criteria if initial reports of the date and type of surgery were corroborated by at least two independent sources of information through a well-established protocol of public newspaper archives, team injury reports, and player profiles. Players with other concomitant injuries of the knee or treated nonoperatively were excluded. One hundred and three athletes across professional baseball, basketball, American football, and soccer athletes were identified and met inclusion criteria. RTP rate, career length, and sports-specific performance statistics (i.e. player efficiency rating (PER) for professional basketball players) before and after surgery were collected for each athlete.Results: Seventy-nine (76.7%) professional athletes successfully RTP. American football athletes had the lowest RTP rate and the largest drop in performance in post-operative season 1 (P < 0.001). These athletes also experienced the shortest adjusted career lengths (P = 0.003) compared to players in the other sports. Basketball athletes played significantly less games through post-operative seasons 1 to 3 (P < 0.05). Soccer athletes had less goals and assists per game and played fewer games (P < 0.05) in post-operative season 1 that recovered to baseline by seasons 2 and 3.Conclusion: A patellar tendon rupture is a potentially devastating injury for the professional athlete. American football players appeared to have the worst postoperative outcome with the lowest RTP rate and a most significant decrease in performance in the first postoperative season. This procedure also had a significant short-term impact on soccer athletes who sustained decreases in short-term game performance. These findings are likely explained by the unique physical demands imposed by each sport.","The paper analyzes the impact of patellar tendon repair on the career outcomes of professional athletes across four sports: baseball, basketball, American football, and soccer. It highlights that American football athletes experienced the lowest return to play rates and significant declines in performance, while soccer athletes showed a reduction in game performance in the first postoperative season but recovered by seasons two and three."
"Correlations Between Vertical Ground Reaction Force, Sagittal Joint Angles, and the Muscle Co-Contraction Index During Single-Leg Jump-Landing",2019-07-10,,,,"Background: Impact and lower extremity joint angles during landing are factors that can increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. However, the correlations between these factors and lower extremity muscle activation during the flight phase, which may affect these factors, are unknown. Objectives: The present study aimed to clarify the correlations between the peak vertical ground reaction force (pVGRF), sagittal joint angles during the landing phase, and the vastus medialis (VM) and semitendinosus (ST) muscle co-contraction index (CCI) during the flight phase in single-leg jump-landing. Methods: Fourteen healthy, physically active volunteers (age, 22.6 ± 2.7 years; height, 164.4 ± 7.6 cm; body weight, 58.9 ± 8.9 kg; body mass index, 21.7 ± 2.3 kg/m2) participated. All subjects performed a single-leg jump-landing task. The pVGRF variables and the sagittal joint angles during the landing phase were measured. The CCI between the VM and ST during the flight phase was measured. The correlations between the VGRF variables, sagittal joint angles, and CCI were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The knee flexion angle at the pVGRF was negatively correlated with the magnitude of pVGRF (ρ = -0.609, P = 0.021). The knee flexion angle at the pVGRF was negatively correlated with the CCI during the flight phase in single-leg jump-landing (ρ = -0.627, P = 0.016). Conclusions: An excessive CCI between the VM and ST during the flight phase might be indirectly related to a greater landing impact after a single-leg jump.","This study investigates the relationships between peak vertical ground reaction force (pVGRF), sagittal joint angles, and the muscle co-contraction index (CCI) of the vastus medialis and semitendinosus during single-leg jump-landings. The findings indicate that a higher muscle co-contraction during the flight phase may be associated with increased landing impact, highlighting potential implications for injury risk in athletes."
Effectiveness of Active Rehabilitation Program on Sports Hernia: Randomized Control Trial,2019-06-28,,,,"Objective To determine whether an active rehabilitation program that involves repetitive effortful muscle contractions, including core stability, balancing exercises, progressive resistance exercises, and running activities, after a sports hernia, is effective. Methods Forty soccer players with sports hernias were randomly divided into two equal groups: group A (active rehabilitation program) and group B (conventional treatment). The methods of assessment included a visual analog scale (VAS) and hip internal and external range of motion assessments. Group A received conventional treatment (heat, massage, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and mobilization) plus an active rehabilitation program, while group B received only conventional treatment. Three treatment sessions were given each week for 2 months. Evaluations were performed pre- and post-treatment. Results A decrease in VAS was seen in both groups at the end of treatment, 80.25% in group A and 41.93% in group B. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p=0.0001), whereas there were no statistical differences in internal and external rotation between the groups at the end of treatment (p>0.05). After treatment, an improvement in outcome measures of group A compared to group B (p=0.01) was seen. Thirteen patients in group A and only three patients in group B returned to sports activities without groin pain. Conclusion Active rehabilitation was effective for sports hernia management measured by a decrease in pain and the return to sports. Keywords: Sport hernia, Visual analog scale (VAS), Active rehabilitation",This paper investigates the effectiveness of an active rehabilitation program for soccer players suffering from sports hernias compared to conventional treatment. The findings demonstrate that the active rehabilitation approach resulted in significantly greater pain reduction and a higher return rate to sports activities without groin pain.
Cognitive Disorders Among Incoming College Football Athletes: Legal and Medical Implications of Undisclosed Inclusion in Concussion Research,2019-06-06,,,,"Concussion research in the United States commonly relies on collegiate athletes as study subjects. Such research recognizes learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders (LD/ADHD) as co-morbidities that should be addressed in concussion research and management. This forensic study has three objectives: 1) to investigate the prevalence of such diagnoses and examine neuropsychological test results among incoming college football players at a major US university 2) to examine how LD/ADHD diagnoses were addressed in concussion research that included such athletes, and 3) to address the implication of these results for ongoing concussion litigation. This study observed LD/ADHD rates among football athletes exceeding 50% in multiple cohort-years, a degree of magnitude greater than the rate among general college student populations. Neuropsychological testing revealed scores among some incoming freshman college football players consistent with those of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Evidence of cognitive impairment among incoming college football players raises concern over the potential effects of cumulative exposure to head trauma and the increased risk associated with continued participation in collision sports. We discuss the implications of our findings for concussion litigation and research ethics.","The paper investigates the prevalence of learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders (LD/ADHD) among incoming college football players, highlighting that rates exceed 50% in several cohorts. It also discusses the implications of these findings for concussion research, particularly regarding the assessment of neuropsychological test results and the potential link to cognitive impairment and concussion litigation."
Surface Electromyography Analysis of Three Squat Exercises,2019-06-01,,,,"Abstract The aim of this study was to perform an electromyography comparison of three commonly used lower limb injury prevention exercises: a single-leg squat on a bench (SLSB), a double-leg squat (DLS) and a double-leg squat on a BOSU® balance trainer (DLSB). After determining the maximum isometric voluntary contraction of the hamstring and quadriceps, eight female athletes performed 3 repetitions of each exercise, while electromyography activity of the biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) was monitored. Comparisons between exercises revealed higher activation in BF (descending phase: p = 0.016, d = 1.36; ascending phase: p = 0.046, d = 1.11), ST (descending phase: p = 0.04, d = 1.87; ascending phase: p = 0.04, d = 1.87), VL (ascending phase: p = 0.04, d = 1.17) and VM (descending phase: p = 0.05, d = 1.11; ascending phase: p = 0.021, d = 1.133) muscles for the SLSB compared to the DLSQ. Furthermore, higher muscular activation of the ST (ascending phase: p = 0.01, d = 1.51; descending phase: p = 0.09, d = 0.96) and VM (ascending phase: p = 0.065, d = 1.03; descending phase: p = 0.062, d = 1.05) during the SLSB with respect to the DLSB was observed. In conclusion, the SLSB elicits higher neuromuscular activation in both hamstring and quadriceps muscles compared to the other two analysed exercises. Additionally, the higher muscle activation of both medial muscles (ST and VM) during the SLSB suggests that single leg squatting exercises may enhance lower limb medial to lateral balance, and improve knee stability in the frontal plane.","This paper investigates the electromyographic activity of the hamstring and quadriceps muscles during three squat exercises: the single-leg squat on a bench, double-leg squat, and double-leg squat on a BOSU balance trainer. The findings indicate that the single-leg squat on a bench elicited higher muscle activation in key lower limb muscles, suggesting it may be beneficial for improving knee stability and balance."
Soccer Sonification: Enhancing Viewer Experience,2019-06-01,,,,"We present multiple approaches to soccer soniﬁcation, focusing on enhancing the experience for a general audience. For this work, we developed our own soccer data set through computer vision analysis of footage from a tactical overhead camera. This data set included X, Y, coordinates for the ball and players throughout, as well as passes, steals and goals. After a divergent creation process, we developed four main methods of sports soniﬁcation for entertainment. For the Tempo Variation and Pitch Variation methods, tempo or pitch is operationalized to demonstrate ball and player movement data. The Key Moments method features only pass, steal and goal data, while the Musical Moments method takes ex-isting music and attempts to align the track with important data points. Evaluation was done using a combination of qualitative focus groups and quantitative surveys, with 36 participants completing hour long sessions. Results indicated an overall preference for the Pitch Variation and Musical Moments methods, and revealed a robust trade-off between usability and enjoyability.","The paper discusses various approaches to soccer sonification aimed at enhancing viewer experience by translating soccer data into auditory feedback through methods such as Tempo Variation and Musical Moments. A dataset generated from computer vision analysis allows for the evaluation of these sonification techniques, with participants expressing a preference for certain methods that balance usability and enjoyment."
Clinical outcome 5 years after Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization of acute ACL ruptures,2019-06-01,,,,"Aims and Objectives: Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilisation (DIS) is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) preserving surgical procedure for acute ACL injuries. A braided suture and a threaded sleeve containing a preloaded spring fixed into the proximal tibia provides continuous biomechanical stability. In combination with mircofracturing, self-healing of the ACL is promoted. Materials and Methods: Between January and November 2013 65 patients with an acute ACL rupture treated by Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilisation (DIS) were included in this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were acute ACL injury, a positive Lachman test compared to the healthy contralateral side and closed growth plates. The following demographic patient data was preoperatively recorded: age, gender, weight, activity scores (Tegner, Lysholm, IKDC), type of injury, ap-translation of both knees measured by KT-1000 or Rolimeter, knee function and prior surgeries to the knees. Furthermore pivot shift test, acl rupture type, days until surgery, operating time, pre-existing pathologies and concomitant injuries were detected during surgery. The result of the reconstruction was assessed by rating it as anatomical, almost anatomical or non-anatomical. Patients were followed-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after surgery. Patient satisfaction was detected recorded on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale from 0-10. Results: 34 men and 31 women were included. Mean age was 32.6 years (range 15 to 62 years). More than 70% of the injuries were soccer or handball associated. In 24 patients meniscal tears had to be repaired and in 4 patients cartilage damages had to be treated. All patients could be examinated 5 years after surgery. Within the follow up period 8 reruptures occured which were treated by one-step ACL reconstruction using an ipsilateral semitendinosus autograft. 4 patients had to be revised performing an arthrolysis due to extension deficit. At 5 years, Tegner Score averaged at 4.9 (compared to 5.5 pre-operatively). IKDC had an average of 90 (98). Lysholm score was at 95 (99). Patient satisfaction was 8.5. Conclusion: With the use of DIS, ACL preserving restoration of knee joint kinematics and mid-term survival of the repaired ACL after acute acl rupture can be achieved. Perioperative morbidity is reduced since harvesting of tendon grafts is not required. In case of recurrent instability or rerupture, conventional ACL reconstruction can still be performed. Knee function scores have shown a good rehabilitation and return to pre-trauma activity levels. However, long-term results are required to confirm safety and effectivity of the presented technique.","The paper evaluates the clinical outcomes of Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization (DIS) for acute ACL injuries over a five-year follow-up period. Key findings indicate that DIS promotes knee joint kinematics restoration and patient satisfaction, reduces perioperative morbidity by avoiding tendon graft harvesting, and allows for further ACL reconstruction if needed due to instability or rerupture."
Evaluation Of A Novel Acl Injury Prevention Technique:can Martial Arts Fall Training (break-falling And Rolling) Alter The Lower Extremity At-risk Biomechanics In Soccer Athletes?,2019-06-01,,,,"PURPOSE: We propose that by introducing martial arts fall training (specifically break-falling and rolling), the neuropathways in these athletes will be trained to recognize and avoid at risk postures by having an alternative response. Given the absence of research utilizing martial arts falling techniques in other sports, this study aims to compare lower extremity biomechanics and risk factors in soccer athletes with fall training compared to those without. METHODS: 5 youth premier soccer athletes between the ages of 9 and 16 were recruited for participation. Subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. All subjects continued their usual soccer training. The intervention group completed a twice weekly 10-week training program in addition to their usual training, taught by a karate and aikido expert at the level of 3rdthdegree black belt. At baseline and after the 10 week program was completed, all subjects underwent a biomechanical evaluation that measured hip and knee movement/position in frontal, transverse, and sagittal planes at 4 different time points during a drop fall. A mixed factorial ANOVA model was used to determine the effects of the intervention training on the kinematic variables of interest. The between subjects' factor was treatment group (intervention and control) and the within subjects factor was time point (pre-intervention and post-intervention). The test of the interaction between group and time point was used to determine if the intervention produced change in the variables of interest. The alpha level of significance for this study is set at the 0.05 level. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in knee flexion in the sagittal plane at initial contact when comparing pre and post-intervention (-4.802 degrees, P <0.001). There was also a significant decrease in knee flexion in the sagittal plane at heel strike 33ms (-7.384 degrees, P<0.001). There was no significant change in any of the other motion points examined. CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant change in body mechanics when comparing pre and post-break falling intervention.Pprior research has shown that neuromuscular programs decrease ACL injury rates when they are started at an early age and continued with strong compliance.","This paper investigates the impact of martial arts fall training on the lower extremity biomechanics of soccer athletes to identify potential risk factors for ACL injuries. The study found that the intervention significantly decreased knee flexion at initial contact and heel strike, suggesting that incorporating break-falling techniques may improve body mechanics and contribute to injury prevention in youth soccer players."
Use Of A Clinic-Based ACL Prediction Algorithm In Division III Female Soccer And Basketball Players,2019-06-01,,,,"During landing and pivoting movements female athletes have an increased lower extremity valgus alignment and knee abduction moment (KAM) making them four to six times more likely than males to sustain a sports-related, non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. PURPOSE: To utilize a clinic-based ACL prediction algorithm developed by Myer, Ford and Hewett (2011) that determines the probability of high knee abduction moment (KAM) in Division III female soccer and basketball players. METHODS: Twenty female athletes were recruited (n = 10 basketball, n = 10 soccer). Five measures were obtained and utilized in the prediction algorithm, namely tibial length, body mass, knee valgus, knee flexion range of motion, and quadriceps-to-hamstring isokinetic strength ratio. A prediction nomogram was applied to award a point value for each variable, which when summed generated a probability of high knee abduction moment (KAM). High KAM is associated with a higher risk of ACL injury. In each group a dependent t-test was used to compare KAM in the left and right leg. Significance was tested at p <0.05. RESULTS: The probability of high KAM in basketball and soccer players was higher in the left leg compared to the right leg. In soccer players, this difference in KAM between the left and right leg was significant (basketball: L = 0.76 ± 0.27, R = 0.71 ± 0.24, t(9) = 0.82, p = 0.43; soccer: L = 0.64 ± 0.31, R = 0.49 ± 0.31, t(9) = 2.65, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The higher KAM scores for the basketball players suggest that they may be at a greater risk for ACL injury compared to the soccer players. The significant difference in bilateral KAM scores in the legs of the soccer players suggests a greater risk of ACL injury in the left leg compared to the right leg. This difference may be attributed to leg dominance, although leg dominance was not measured in this study. The current study supports the use of a clinic-based ACL prediction algorithm to evaluate ACL injury risk of athletes when advanced biomechanical equipment is unavailable. Identification of risk of ACL injury allows for potential implementation of injury prevention training.","This paper investigates the use of a clinic-based ACL prediction algorithm to assess the likelihood of high knee abduction moment (KAM) among Division III female soccer and basketball players, both of whom are at increased risk for ACL injuries. The study finds elevated KAM in basketball players compared to soccer players, with a significant difference noted in left leg KAM among soccer players, indicating varying injury risk profiles linked to leg dominance."
Landing Biomechanics Following Patellar And Hamstring Tendon Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2019-06-01,,,,"Individuals with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) have different landing adaptations depending if they received patellar (PG) or hamstring tendon (HG) graft reconstruction. No study has evaluated landing biomechanics following these procedures in soccer players. PURPOSE: To compare landing biomechanics between soccer players following PG or HG ACLR during planned and unplanned landing tasks. METHODS: Six soccer players with a PG ACLR (age, 25.83 ± 4.44 years; height, 1.73 ± 0.04 m; weight, 70.91 ± 8.00 kg, BMI, 23.64 ± 3.29 kg/m2, time since surgery, 4 ± 3.38 years) and 6 soccer players with a HG ACLR (age, 26.83 ± 3.25 years; height, 1.69 ± 0.08 m; weight, 67 ± 6.16 kg, BMI, 23.40 ± 2.08 kg/m2 time since surgery, 5 ± 2.89 years) participated in the study. Planned landing (PL) included jumping forward and landing on two force plates, whereas unplanned landing (UL) included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force plates. Participants performed 4 trials of each landing task. Outcome measures included peak flexion angles and extension moments of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, and electromyography of gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles. A 2×2 ANOVA (group × landing) was performed for each measure. RESULTS: There were no significant group × landing interactions for any of the outcomes. Significant main effects of landing were found. The UL showed smaller hip flexion (F1,10 = 48.77, p < 0.001), smaller knee flexion (F1,10 = 28.02, p < 0.001), and lower ankle platarflexion moments (F1,10 = 26.48, p < 0.001). Significant main effects for group for quadriceps muscle and hip extension moments were found showing that the PG group landed with reduced quadriceps activity (F1,10 = 11.72, p = 0.007), and greater hip extension moments (F1,10 = 14.69, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The UL showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with the PL. Although the PG group showed nearly similar landing biomechanics to the HG group during both maneuvers, they (PG) demonstrated a protective landing pattern by reducing quadriceps activity and increasing the demand on the hip extensors. These findings reinforce the clinical emphasis on improving the use of hip and knee joints during landing to reduce the risk of consequent injuries in soccer players following PG ACLR.","This paper investigates the differences in landing biomechanics between soccer players who underwent patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon graft ACL reconstruction. The findings reveal that while both groups exhibit similar landing techniques, the patellar group demonstrates a protective landing pattern with reduced quadriceps activity and increased hip extension moments, emphasizing the need for improved hip and knee joint usage to mitigate injury risk."
Appropriate Medical Care Standards for Organizations Sponsoring Athletic Activity for the Secondary School–Aged Athlete: A Summary Statement,2019-05-28,,,,"Objective To present the appropriate medical care standards for organizations that sponsor athletic activities for secondary school–aged athletes. Data Sources To develop the current standards and identify current best-practices evidence, the task force used a multistep process that included reviewing the existing 2004 Appropriate Medical Care for Secondary School–Aged Athletes consensus points and cross-referencing of National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) statements and official documents from the strategic alliance (the NATA, NATA Foundation, Board of Certification, and Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education). Gaps in the recommendations from the 2004 Appropriate Medical Care for Secondary School–Aged Athletes document were identified by the task force, and the new appropriate medical care standards were developed and refined. Conclusions and Recommendations Twelve standards, with supporting substandards, were developed that encompassed readiness to participate in activity; facilities; equipment; protective materials; environmental policies; nutrition, hydration, and dietary supplementation; wellness and long-term health; comprehensive emergency action plans; on-site immediate care; on-site therapeutic interventions; psychological concerns; and athletic health care administration. Collectively, these standards describe a comprehensive approach to providing appropriate health care to secondary school–aged athletes and should serve as a framework with which organizations can evaluate and improve the medical care supplied to adolescent athletes.","This paper presents a comprehensive set of medical care standards for organizations sponsoring athletic activities for secondary school-aged athletes. It identifies gaps in previous recommendations and outlines twelve key standards related to athlete readiness, facilities, nutrition, emergency care, and overall health care administration to enhance the quality of medical care provided to adolescent athletes."
"Effect of Graft Type on Thigh Circumference, Knee Range of Motion, and Lower-Extremity Strength in Pediatric and Adolescent Males Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction",2019-05-16,,,,"Context : To treat anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery is currently a standard of the care. However, effect of graft type including bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB), hamstring tendon, or iliotibial band (ITB) on thigh size, knee range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength are understudied. Objective : To compare postoperative thigh circumference, knee ROM, and hip and thigh muscle strength in adolescent males who underwent ACLR, based on the 3 different autograft types: BTB, hamstring (HS), and ITB. Setting : Biomechanical laboratory. Participants : Male ACLR patients who are younger than 22 years of age (total N = 164). Intervention : At 6- to 9-month postoperative visits, thigh circumference, knee ROM, and hip and thigh muscle strength were measured. Main Outcome Measures : Deficits of each variable between the uninvolved and ACLR limb were compared for pediatric and adolescent ACLR males in the BTB, HS, and ITB cohorts. Baseline characteristics, including physical demographics and meniscus tear status, were compared, and differences identified were treated as covariates and incorporated in analysis of covariance. Results : Data were from 164 adolescent male ACLR patients [mean age 15.7 (1.2) years]. There were no statistical differences in thigh circumference, knee ROM, hip abductor, and hip-extensor strength among the 3 autografts. However, patients with BTB demonstrated 12.2% deficits in quadriceps strength compared with 0.5% surplus in HS patients ( P = .002) and 1.2% deficits in ITB patients ( P = .03). Patients with HS showed 31.7% deficits in hamstring strength compared with 5.4% deficits in BTB ( P = .001) and 7.7% deficits in ITB ( P = .001) groups at 6- to 9-month postoperative visits. Conclusion : Adolescent male ACLR patients with BTB and HS autografts demonstrated significant deficits in quadriceps and hamstring strength, respectively, at 6 to 9 months postoperatively. Minimal lower-extremity strength deficits were demonstrated in pediatric male ACLR patients undergoing ITB harvest.","This study investigates the impact of different graft types (bone–patellar tendon–bone, hamstring tendon, and iliotibial band) on postoperative recovery in terms of thigh circumference, knee range of motion (ROM), and lower-extremity strength in adolescent males following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The results indicate that patients with bone–patellar tendon–bone and hamstring tendon grafts exhibited significant deficits in specific muscle strengths compared to those with iliotibial band grafts, highlighting important considerations for surgical graft selection in this population."
Winning at all costs: a review of risk-taking behaviour and sporting injury from an occupational safety and health perspective,2019-05-02,,,,"Professional athletes involved in high-performance sport are at a high injury risk, which may lead to long-term health consequences. Professional athletes often expose themselves to risky behaviours, resulting in a higher acceptance level of occupational risk compared to other occupations. To date, many studies have focused on elite athletes' specific injury prevention techniques. The objective of this narrative review is to (1) summarise elite athletes' attitudes towards important occupational safety and health (OSH) practices, including injury reporting, medicine usage and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and (2) explore factors that may influence elite athletes' injury awareness. If injury awareness were given a similar weighting in elite sports as in any other highly physical occupation, the potential benefits to elite athletes and their long-term health could be highly significant. This review identifies that most elite athletes are not aware that sporting injuries are occupational injuries requiring behaviours determined by OSH rules. All the 39 studies identified met the moderate methodological quality criteria according to the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The factors impeding athletes' injury awareness from achieving occupational health standards are discussed from three safety management perspectives: organisational, societal and individual. This review contributes to a better understanding of how to build a positive safety culture, one that could reduce elite athletes' injury rate and improve their long-term wellbeing. Further research is required to develop a quantitative measurement instrument to evaluate occupational health awareness in the sport context. Based on the papers reviewed, the study population was categorised as elite, professional, high-performance amateur and student-athletes.","This paper reviews risk-taking behavior in professional athletes and its implications for injury and long-term health from an occupational safety and health perspective. It highlights the need for greater injury awareness among elite athletes regarding the occupational nature of sports injuries and discusses factors influencing their attitudes toward safety practices, with an aim to foster a positive safety culture in high-performance sports."
Patellar and hamstring autografts are associated with different jump task loading asymmetries after ACL reconstruction,2019-05-01,,,,"Abstract After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), there is a higher re‐injury rate to the contralateral limb in athletes who undergo surgery using a bone‐patellar‐tendon‐bone (BPTB) autograft than using a semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. This may be influenced by differing lower‐limb loading asymmetries present when athletes of each graft type return to play (RTP). The aim of this study was to compare bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) phase‐specific impulse asymmetries between athletes with BPTB and HT autografts 9 months post‐ACLR, and to identify the relationship between impulse and isokinetic strength asymmetries. Male field sport athletes with a BPTB (n = 22) or HT (n = 22) autograft were tested approximately 9 months post‐ACLR. An uninjured control group (n = 22) was also tested on a single occasion. Phase‐specific bilateral absolute impulse asymmetries were calculated during the CMJ and compared between groups using Kruskal‐Wallis and post‐hoc testing. A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between impulse asymmetries and isokinetic concentric knee extensor strength asymmetries. BPTB athletes demonstrated greater impulse asymmetries than HT athletes during the eccentric ( P = 0.01) and concentric ( P = 0.008) phases of the jump. Isokinetic strength asymmetry was a significant predictor of CMJ concentric impulse asymmetry in both BPTB ( r 2 = 0.39) and HT athletes ( r 2 = 0.18) but not eccentric impulse asymmetry in any group. The greater loading asymmetries demonstrated by BPTB than HT athletes 9 months after ACLR may contribute to the differing incidence rates of contralateral ACL injury. The findings suggest that graft‐specific loading asymmetries should be targeted during rehabilitation prior to RTP.","This paper examines the differences in bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) loading asymmetries between athletes undergoing ACL reconstruction with either bone-patellar-tendon (BPTB) or hamstring tendon (HT) autografts. The study finds that athletes with BPTB autografts exhibit greater impulse asymmetries compared to those with HT autografts, which may influence re-injury rates and suggests the importance of addressing graft-specific loading asymmetries during rehabilitation."
Technology in Sports Biomechanics,2019-05-01,,,,"Biomechanics is defined as the study of the structure and function of biological systems by the methods of mechanics. The range of applications and methodologies in biomechanics is varied, from gait analysis to manufacturing of implants, orthotics or prosthetics devices, rehabilitation technology, fluid dynamics analysis in biological systems, and tissue and cellular biomechanics. An underlying understanding of fundamental applied mechanics principles is required to understand the stresses and strains the body components cause, or are subject to, under different activities. However, it is also necessary to know which biological components are put in place to absorb shock and protect the living systems. Motion-capture technology, material mechanical testing, medical imaging, computer-aided design, and computational fluid dynamics are some of the methodologies required to work in the field. All of these areas come together when biomechanics applications are used in the analysis of sports performance.","The paper discusses the application of biomechanics in sports, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of mechanics in biological systems to analyze sports performance. Key methodologies such as motion-capture technology, medical imaging, and material testing are highlighted as essential tools for investigating the structure and function of the body during athletic activities."
Exploring the Role of Wearable Technology in Sport Kinematics and Kinetics: A Systematic Review,2019-04-02,,,,"The aim of this review was to understand the use of wearable technology in sport in order to enhance performance and prevent injury. Understanding sports biomechanics is important for injury prevention and performance enhancement and is traditionally assessed using optical motion capture. However, such approaches are limited by capture volume restricting assessment to a laboratory environment, a factor that can be overcome by wearable technology. A systematic search was carried out across seven databases where wearable technology was employed to assess kinetic and kinematic variables in sport. Articles were excluded if they focused on sensor design and did not measure kinetic or kinematic variables or apply the technology on targeted participants. A total of 33 articles were included for full-text analysis where participants took part in a sport and performed dynamic movements relating to performance monitored by wearable technologies. Inertial measurement units, flex sensors and magnetic field and angular rate sensors were among the devices used in over 15 sports to quantify motion. Wearable technology usage is still in an exploratory phase, but there is potential for this technology to positively influence coaching practice and athletes' technique.","The paper reviews the application of wearable technology in sports to improve performance and prevent injury, highlighting its role in assessing kinetic and kinematic variables outside laboratory settings. It analyzes 33 studies that utilized various wearable devices across different sports, emphasizing the potential of this technology to enhance coaching and athlete techniques."
The FIFA 11+ does not alter physical performance of amateur futsal players,2019-04-01,,,,"The ability of the FIFA 11+ to enhance performance has demonstrated controversial results. Hence, we examined the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on performance in male amateur futsal players.Seventy-one male futsal players from six amateur clubs were recruited and randomized to an intervention (N.=37, age: 27.0±5.1 years) or a control group (N.=34, age: 26.0±5.1 years). The intervention group was submitted to 10 weeks of FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, 2 sessions/week, followed by a 10-week follow-up period, while the control group performed regular futsal warm-ups during the training sessions. During the follow-up period both groups performed only regular warm-ups during their training sessions. Physical performance was assessed by measuring agility (T-test), sprint (30 m sprint), flexibility (sit-and-reach test) and vertical jump performance (squat jump).Differences between groups were found at baseline for training exposure, body mass index, body weight, flexibility, and sprint. The results of the effect of the FIFA 11+ on the sit-and-reach test, speed and agility did not show differences pre-post intervention, as well as for the 10-week follow-up. Jump performance, showed a significant difference in favor of the control group for the intervention period and the follow-up (crude β: -0.04 [95% CI: -0.06; -0.01]; -0.03 [95% CI: -0.06; -0.00], respectively), however after adjustment for the baseline differences the confidence interval fell out of the range of significance for the intervention and follow-up period (adjusted β, -0.05 [95% CI: -0.10; 0.00]; -0.05 [95% CI: -0.10; 0.04]).The present study has shown no short and long-term performance enhancement in sprint, flexibility, agility and jump performance after the FIFA 11+ in male amateur futsal players.","This paper investigates the effectiveness of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program on the physical performance of male amateur futsal players. The study found no significant improvements in agility, sprint, flexibility, or jump performance after the intervention compared to a control group performing regular warm-ups."
5 Frontal plane femoral adduction during single-leg landing and low back pain in young athletes: a prospective profits cohort study,2019-04-01,,,,"<h3>Introduction</h3> Prospective studies investigating risk factors for low back pain (LBP) in young athletes are limited. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the association between LBP and selected biomechanical factors and postural stability during dynamic movement tasks in young athletes. <h3>Materials and methods</h3> 396 young floorball and basketball players (mean age 15.8±1.9) were included and followed prospectively for 1–3 years (2011–2014). In the beginning of every study year the players were tested. The physical tests included single-leg squat (SLS), single-leg vertical drop jump (SLVDJ), vertical drop jump (VDJ) and Star Reach Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Individual exposure time and LBP resulting in time-loss were recorded prospectively. Cox's proportional hazard models with mixed effects and time-varying risk factors were used. <h3>Results</h3> In SLVDJ landing with non-dominant leg, the risk for general LBP and non-traumatic LBP in specific, was significantly higher with increased femoral adduction (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.19 and HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.22, respectively) and significantly lower with increased in femur-pelvic angle (FPA; angle-between pelvis and femur) (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88–0.99 and HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.99, respectively). However, the ROC analysis revealed poor combined sensitivity and specificity for femoral adduction and for FPA. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Increased femoral adduction and decreased FPA during SLVDJ landing are associated with risk of LBP in young team ball players. However, the identified risk factors do not discriminate players with or without future LBP well enough and therefore further studies on effect of neuromuscular training on lumbo-pelvic control and LBP incidence are warranted.","This study investigates the relationship between low back pain (LBP) and specific biomechanical factors, such as frontal plane femoral adduction and femur-pelvic angle, during dynamic movements in young athletes. The findings indicate that increased femoral adduction is associated with a higher risk of LBP, but the identified risk factors lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict future LBP, suggesting a need for further research on neuromuscular training interventions."
Turn Characteristics During Gait Differ With and Without a Cognitive Demand Among College Athletes,2019-03-12,,,,"Context : Sports often involve complex movement patterns, such as turning. Although cognitive load effects on gait patterns are well known, little is known on how it affects biomechanics of turning gait among athletes. Such information could help evaluate how concussion affects turning gait required for daily living and sports. Objective : To determine the effect of a dual task on biomechanics of turning while walking among college athletes. Design : Cross-sectional study. Setting : University laboratory. Participants : Fifty-three participants performed 5 trials of a 20-m walk under single- and dual-task conditions at self-selected speed with a 180° turn at 10-m mark. The cognitive load included subtraction, spelling words backward, or reciting the months backward. Interventions : Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures : Turn duration, turning velocity, number of steps, SD of turn duration and velocity, and coefficient of variation of turn duration and velocity. Results : Participants turned significantly slower (155.99 [3.71] cm/s vs 183.52 [4.17] cm/s; P &lt; .001) and took longer time to complete the turn (2.63 [0.05] s vs 2.33 [0.04] s; P &lt; .001) while dual tasking, albeit taking similar number of steps to complete the turn. Participants also showed more variability in turning time under the dual-task condition (SD of turn duration = 0.39 vs 0.31 s; P = .004). Conclusions : Overall, college athletes turned slower and showed more variability during turning gait while performing a concurrent cognitive dual-task turning compared with single-task turning. The slower velocity increased variability may be representative of specific strategy of turning gait while dual tasking, which may be a result of the split attention to perform the cognitive task. The current study provides descriptive values of absolute and variability turning gait parameters for sports medicine personnel to use while they perform their concussion assessments on their college athletes.","This study investigates the effects of cognitive load on the biomechanics of turning gait among college athletes. Findings reveal that dual-tasking significantly slows turning velocity, increases turn completion time, and introduces variability in turning dynamics, highlighting the implications for concussion assessments in sports medicine."
Effects of Short-term Plyometric Training on Countermovement Vertical Jump Height and Kinematics of Take-Off,2020-12-09,,,,"Background: Countermovement vertical jump is a crucial skill in many sports. Plyometric training is a prevalent method to improve athletes' jumping ability. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a 6-week plyometric training on the kinematics of take-off and countermovement vertical jump height. Methods: Fifteen young, healthy male subjects performed plyometric exercises in three sessions per week for six weeks. Digital videos of pre-training and post-training jumps were captured. The Kinovea software was used to measure the kinematic parameters of take-off in the sagittal plane. Pre and post-training values were compared by paired sample t-test with the statistical significance level of P &lt; 0.05. Results: Post-training results showed a higher jump height (P &lt; 0.05), more flexed shoulder, and more extensive hip and knee at take-off (P &lt; 0.05). Also, while hip extension velocity was decreased, shoulder flexion and knee extension velocities were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The 6-week plyometric training, including 720 jumps, improved shoulder flexion, and hip and knee extensions at take-off, resulting in high CMJ height. We employed plyometric training to improve the shoulder flexion and hip and knee extension velocities and increase CMJ height.","This study investigates the impact of a 6-week plyometric training regimen on the kinematics of take-off and countermovement vertical jump height among young male athletes. Results indicate significant improvements in jump height and variations in take-off kinematics, such as increased shoulder flexion and hip and knee extension velocities."
The 2019 International Society of Hip Preservation (ISHA) physiotherapy agreement on assessment and treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS): an international consensus statement,2020-12-01,,,,"Abstract The 2019 International Society of Hip Preservation (ISHA) physiotherapy agreement on femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) was intended to build an international physiotherapy consensus on the assessment, non-surgical physiotherapy treatment, pre-/post-operative management, and return to sport decisions for those patients with FAIS. The panel consisted of 11 physiotherapists and 8 orthopaedic surgeons. There is limited evidence regarding the use of physiotherapy in the overall management of those with FAIS. Therefore, a group of ISHA member physiotherapists, who treat large numbers of FAIS patients and have extensive experience in this area, constructed a consensus statement to guide physiotherapy-related decisions in the overall management of those with FAIS. The consensus was conducted using a modified Delphi technique. Six major topics were the focus of the consensus statement: (i) hip assessment, (ii) non-surgical physiotherapy management, (iii) pre-habilitation prior to hip arthroscopy, (iv) post-operative physiotherapy rehabilitation, (v) stages of post-operative rehabilitation and (vi) return to sports criteria/guidelines after surgery.","The paper presents the 2019 ISHA agreement on physiotherapy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS), aiming to establish an international consensus on assessment and treatment strategies in managing FAIS patients. Key focus areas include non-surgical physiotherapy, pre- and post-operative management, rehabilitation stages, and guidelines for returning to sports, developed through a consensus of experienced physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons."
Semi-Rigid Cast versus Elastic Bandage in Grade II Lateral Ankle Sprain Treatment,2020-12-01,,,,"Background.Treatment options for lateral ankle sprains continue to evolve as advances are made in terms of techniques and materials.Objectives.This study was performed to evaluate clinical outcomes and satisfaction between two immobilization materials, semi-rigid cast, and elastic bandages.Methods.This study was a non-randomized controlled study.Fifty-four patients have undergone immobilization for their sprained ankle and divided into two groups according to the material selection.There were 27 patients in each group.VAS score, Karlsson score, satisfaction scale, and presence of later ankle instability was obtained.Standard descriptive measurement, independent samples t-test, and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.Results.The mean age was 25.29 ± 6.04 years old.Sports injury was accounted for 27 patients (50%), followed by internal damage (24 patients; 44.4%).VAS and Karlsson's scores were taken and validated by authors and significantly better in semi-rigid cast groups compared with the elastic bandage group in the first week and second-week follow-up.No significant differences in overall satisfaction and ankle stability after one year.Conclusion.This study showed that the application of semi-rigid cast yielded quicker recovery in patients with ankle sprain without any decline in satisfaction scale.Therefore, a semi-rigid cast could be preferred over elastic bandage for acute ankle sprains.","The paper evaluates the clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction between semi-rigid casts and elastic bandages for treating Grade II lateral ankle sprains. Results indicate that the semi-rigid cast group experienced quicker recovery in the first two weeks, making it a preferable option for acute ankle sprains without compromising long-term satisfaction or stability."
Combinations of trabecular and cortical bone properties distinguish various loading modalities between athletes and controls,2020-11-27,,,,"Abstract Objectives Variation in trabecular and cortical bone properties is often used to infer habitual behavior in the past. However, the structures of both types of bone are rarely considered together and may even contradict each other in functional interpretations. We examine trabecular and cortical bone properties in various athletes and sedentary controls to clarify the associations between combinations of cortical and trabecular bone properties and various loading modalities. Materials and methods We compare trabecular and cortical bone properties using peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of the tibia between groups of 83 male athletes (running, hockey, swimming, cricket) and sedentary controls using Bayesian multilevel models. We quantify midshaft cortical bone rigidity and area (J, CA), midshaft shape index (Imax/Imin), and mean trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in the distal tibia. Results All groups show unique combinations of biomechanical properties. Cortical bone rigidity is high in sports that involve impact loading (cricket, running, hockey) and low in nonimpact loaded swimmers and controls. Runners have more anteroposteriorly elliptical midshafts compared to other groups. Interestingly, all athletes have greater trabecular BMD compared to controls, but do not differ credibly among each other. Discussion Results suggest that cortical midshaft hypertrophy is associated with impact loading while trabecular BMD is positively associated with both impact and nonimpact loading. Midshaft shape is associated with directionality of loading. Individuals from the different categories overlap substantially, but group means differ credibly, suggesting that nuanced group‐level inferences of habitual behavior are possible when combinations of trabecular and cortical bone are analyzed.","The paper investigates the variations in trabecular and cortical bone properties among different athlete groups and sedentary controls to better understand the relationship between these bone structures and various loading modalities. It finds that athletes exhibit unique combinations of biomechanical properties correlated with their sport's loading type, with notable differences in cortical bone rigidity and trabecular bone mineral density across the groups studied."
Talent Research in Sport 1990–2018: A Scoping Review,2020-11-25,,,,"Several recent systematic and targeted reviews have highlighted limitations in our understanding of talent in sport. However, a comprehensive profile of where the scientific research has focused would help identify gaps in current knowledge. Our goal in this scoping review was (a) to better understand what others have done in the field of research (e.g., what groups have been examined using what research designs and in what areas), (b) to summarize the constituent areas of research in a meaningful way, (c) to help identify gaps in the research, and (d) to encourage future research to address these gaps. Peer-reviewed articles written in English that met several inclusion criteria were analyzed. A total of 1,899 articles were identified, and the descriptive findings revealed a relatively narrow focus of research on talent in sport. Specifically, the majority of examined articles focused on (a) males only, (b) the sport of soccer, (c) perceptual cognitive variables, (d) developing athletes, (e) adult samples, and (f) cross-sectional designs. For better or worse, the concept of talent remains a central element of how coaches, practitioners, and scientists think about athlete development. Findings from this scoping review highlight the continued need to explore issues related to talent identification, selection, and development in more diverse samples (e.g., female athletes and younger ages) and contexts (e.g., from Africa, Asia, and South America). There is also a clear necessity to focus on under-researched areas using alternative methodologies.","This paper conducts a scoping review of talent research in sport from 1990 to 2018, highlighting the limited focus primarily on male athletes, soccer, and perceptual cognitive variables in adult samples. It identifies significant gaps in the literature and emphasizes the need for diverse research on talent identification, selection, and development, particularly concerning female athletes and younger age groups across various global contexts."
Predictors for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Re-injury after Successful Primary ACL Reconstruction (ACLR),2020-11-01,,,,"Few authors have addressed risk factors related to an ipsilateral graft rupture and contralateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury after return to sports (RTS) following primary ACL reconstruction.Patients with ACL re-injury to either knee after successful primary ACLR were included in Group I and those with no further re-injury were included in Group II. Variables including age, gender, side, body mass index (BMI), thigh atrophy, anterior knee laxity difference between both knees measured by KT-1000 arthrometer, mean time of return to sports (RTS), graft type, type of game, mode of injury, Tegner Activity Score, hormone levels, femoral tunnel length (FTL), posterior tibial slope (PTS) and notch width index (NWI) were studied. Binary logistic regression was used to measure the relative association.A total of 128 athletes were included with 64 in each group. Mean age in Group I and II were 24.90 and 26.47 years respectively. Mean follow-up of Group I and Group II were 24.5 and 20.11 months respectively. Significant correlation was present between ACL re-injury and following risk factors; PTS of >10º, KT difference of >3.0mm, thigh atrophy of >2.50cm and time to RTS <9.50 months P value <0.05). No correlation was found with age, sex, BMI, type of game, Tegner Activity Score, mode of injury, NWI, size of graft, FTL and hormone levels.Possible risk factors include PTS of ≥ 10º, KT difference of ≥ 3.0mm at 1 year follow-up, thigh atrophy of ≥ 2.50cm at 1 year follow-up and RTS <9.5 months after primary ACLR.","This paper investigates risk factors for re-injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in athletes following primary ACL reconstruction. It identifies significant predictors including posterior tibial slope, knee laxity difference, thigh atrophy, and time to return to sports, while noting that age, sex, body mass index, and other variables did not show a correlation with re-injury."
Rehabilitation interventions need more than methodological standardisation: an individualised approach,2020-11-01,,,,"Objectives: The main aim in the current study was to use a single-subject analysis to profile the physical performance characteristics of individuals within an injured group and a between-group approach to profile the group as a whole. These profiles were then used to inform single-subject and between-group rehabilitation interventions. Methods: Fifty-three (28 with athletic groin pain and 25 non-injured) Gaelic football players (24.8 years±7.1 years; 179 cm±5.5 cm; 79.7 kg±9.2 kg) underwent 3D biomechanical analysis, which was used to measure a series of physical performance characteristics. The non-injured group was used to create a ‘performance database’ to compare the injured individuals, and a between-group analysis was also conducted. The scores from each analysis were used to inform the targets of interventions. Results: The analysis highlighted the variety of profiles that existed across the tested individuals and that these profiles differed from that of the between-group analysis. By analysing individuals in a single-subject approach, detail can be seen that is lost with between-group analysis.","The paper emphasizes the necessity for individualized rehabilitation strategies in sports, particularly through a single-subject analysis of physical performance in injured Gaelic football players compared to a non-injured group. It illustrates how detailed profiling can reveal significant variations among individuals that are obscured in broader group analyses, thereby informing targeted rehabilitation interventions."
Safe Return to Play Following ACL Reconstruction in Young Athletes,2020-11-01,,,,"In order to reduce the risk of a second ACL injury following primary ACL reconstruction in young athletes, return to play (RTP) strategies are implemented that utilize temporal, psychological, and functional benchmarks. This strategy should be discussed with patients and their social support group prior to surgery in order to set proper expectations. Physiologically, time is needed for both graft maturation and incorporation as well as neuromuscular recovery. To monitor readiness for return to sport, validated measurement tools should be utilized along with functional assessments to address neuromuscular deficiencies. Patient reported outcome measures and psychological readiness should also be taken into account when assessing athletes’ readiness to return to play.&nbsp; As athletes transition back to sport, ACL injury prevention training programs should be implemented on an ongoing basis. There remains insufficient evidence to support the routine use of functional ACL bracing to prevent ACL re-injury.","This paper discusses strategies for the safe return to play (RTP) for young athletes after ACL reconstruction, emphasizing the importance of temporal, psychological, and functional benchmarks. It highlights the necessity of validated measurement tools and functional assessments to monitor readiness, as well as the ongoing implementation of ACL injury prevention training programs to reduce the risk of re-injury."
"Factors Influencing Base of Gait During Running: Consideration of Sex, Speed, Kinematics, and Anthropometrics",2020-10-16,,,,"Context A narrow base of gait (BOG), the mediolateral distance between the foot and the body's line of gravity at midstance, during running is a suggested cause of injuries such as iliotibial band syndrome and tibial stress injury. However, an understanding of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that influence BOG is lacking, which limits the development of corrective strategies. Objective To determine if BOG varies by sex and running speed and the influence of running kinematics and anthropometrics on BOG. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Record review of routinely collected performance data from a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I intercollegiate athletic program. Patients or Other Participants A total of 166 Division I collegiate athletes (basketball, cross-country, football, soccer). Main Outcome Measure(s) Running biomechanics (N = 166) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived anthropometric data (n = 68) were extracted. Running variables were BOG, step rate, stride length, foot-inclination angle, center-of-mass vertical displacement, heel-to-center of mass anteroposterior distance, and peak stance-phase angles: hip flexion, hip adduction, pelvic drop, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion. Extracted anthropometric variables were height; leg, femur, and tibia length; and anterior-superior iliac spine, hip-joint, and greater trochanter width. We calculated linear mixed-effects models to assess the influence of sex and running speed on BOG and identify the kinematic and anthropometric variables most associated with BOG. Results A significant interaction between sex and running speed on BOG was observed, with males demonstrating a smaller BOG than females at faster speeds and BOG decreasing overall with speed. The kinematic measures most associated with BOG at preferred running speed were foot-inclination angle at initial contact and peak stance-phase hip adduction and ankle dorsiflexion. Anterior-superior iliac spine width was the anthropometric variable most associated with BOG at preferred running speed. Conclusions Sex and running speed must be considered when determining the appropriateness of an individual's BOG. Additionally, BOG was associated with several potentially modifiable kinematic parameters.","The paper investigates how sex and running speed influence the base of gait (BOG) during running, which is linked to various running-related injuries. The findings reveal significant interactions between sex and speed affecting BOG, with males exhibiting a narrower BOG than females at higher speeds, while highlighting key kinematic and anthropometric factors associated with BOG."
Perceptual–Cognitive Function and Unplanned Athletic Movement Task Performance: A Systematic Review,2020-10-14,,,,"The performance of choice-reaction tasks during athletic movement has been demonstrated to evoke unfavorable biomechanics in the lower limb. However, the mechanism of this observation is unknown. We conducted a systematic review examining the association between (1) the biomechanical and functional safety of unplanned sports-related movements (e.g., jumps/runs with a spontaneously indicated landing leg/cutting direction) and (2) markers of perceptual–cognitive function (PCF). A literature search in three databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) identified five relevant articles. The study quality, rated by means of a modified Downs and Black checklist, was moderate to high (average: 13/16 points). Four of five papers, in at least one parameter, found either an association of PCF with task safety or significantly reduced task safety in low vs. high PCF performers. However, as (a) the outcomes, populations and statistical methods of the included trials were highly heterogeneous and (b) only two out of five studies had an adequate control condition (pre-planned movement task), the evidence was classified as conflicting. In summary, PCF may represent a factor affecting injury risk and performance during unplanned sports-related movements, but future research strengthening the evidence for this association is warranted.","This paper reviews the relationship between perceptual-cognitive function (PCF) and the safety of unplanned athletic movements, highlighting evidence that suggests PCF may impact injury risk and performance. The review identified a moderate to high quality of studies, yet due to heterogeneous outcomes and limited control conditions in the literature, the conclusions on the association between PCF and task safety remain conflicting and call for further research."
The biomechanical changes during sport-specific tasks and different commercially available footwear in individuals following meniscectomy,2020-09-20,,,,"Injuries to the meniscus are common particularly in sporting individuals. Traumatic meniscal tears typically occur due to a high impact twisting action on a planted foot, which can be seen in sports such as basketball, football and skiing. Competitive athletes generally agree to having a meniscectomy surgery with the objective of returning to the same level of activity as was considered normal before the injury, however the effect of returning to sport and performing sport-specific tasks has not been researched in depth following meniscectomy. Altered knee mechanics and increased knee loading, like those seen in knee osteoarthritis (OA), have been observed following a meniscectomy, therefore identifying ways to reduce knee loading and slow the progression of OA are a priority. Individuals following meniscectomy have been reported to be 15 times more likely to develop knee OA compared to the general healthy population. Whilst it is well researched that medial partial meniscectomies result in the onset of medial (OA), little is known about the biomechanical effects following lateral meniscectomy in comparison to individuals following medial meniscectomy. Therefore, an improved understanding of biomechanical changes following medial and lateral meniscectomy, specifically during both functional and sport-specific tasks is vital and whether approaches such as the use of different footwear have an influence to aid in offloading the knee. 

To develop a robust and reliable test protocol for the investigation of the biomechanical outcomes in individuals following meniscectomy, a repeatability study was performed, which enabled the development of a protocol that was applied in the following studies of the thesis. The BOOM study investigated biomechanical and clinical outcomes following meniscectomy surgery in 29 individuals following both medial and lateral meniscectomy in comparison to 20 healthy controls. It was found that there were few differences when comparing individuals following medial and lateral meniscectomy, therefore the sub-groups were combined to analyse the knee joint loading. Knee loading was increased in the early stages of rehabilitation during walking, running and landing, highlighting initial effects of non-effective rehabilitation with muscle weakness, stiffness in joint motion and kinesiophobia, which may have the potential to lead on to knee joint degeneration.

Lastly, the Meni-Foot study looked at the use of three different types of footwear including cushioning footwear, stability footwear and lateral wedge footwear in comparison to neutral footwear, to find a way to offload the affected compartment of the knee and slow the risk of OA progression, specifically in a young active population. Lateral wedge footwear was found to offload the medial compartment of the knee and aid individuals following medial meniscectomy, however further research needs to be done looking at a more comfortable shoe with a lateral wedge to offload the medial compartment and a greater medial arch support to offload the lateral compartment whilst considering pain and motion during dynamic tasks.

To summarise the findings in this thesis, other than greater trunk lean in the lateral meniscectomy during walking, there were no significant differences in knee loading between individuals following a medial meniscectomy and individuals following a lateral meniscectomy. The lack of differences in knee loading between medial and lateral meniscectomy groups was unexpected, however it suggested combining groups in the short-term period following surgery was applicable. Individuals on average 6 months post-meniscectomy showed reduced balance, isometric strength and self-reported function. Individuals showed a quadriceps avoidance strategy, with altered muscle activation, stiffer movement patterns and greater kinesiophobia compared to healthy controls. Non-invasive interventions such as lateral wedge footwear can be used to offload the medial compartment of the knee during walking and therefore, could be beneficial for individuals following medial meniscectomy. Further research needs to be done on sport specific tasks and different footwear conditions depending on which compartment of the knee it aims to offload.","This paper investigates the biomechanical changes in individuals following meniscectomy surgery, focusing on the impact of different types of footwear during sport-specific tasks. It highlights the increased knee loading during early rehabilitation and the potential of lateral wedge footwear to reduce this loading, particularly for those with medial meniscectomy, while also emphasizing the need for further research on footwear and functional outcomes in this population."
Adaptation of Design Modules to First-year Engineering Courses and K-12 Outreach: Update on IDEAS Project,2020-09-10,,,,"Abstract Adaptation of Design Modules to K-12 Outreach and First-Year Engineering Courses – Update on ________ ProjectAbstractDesign modules from the ______ Project (NSF #####) developed for a two-semester coursesequence, have been customized for use in other first-year engineering courses and K-12outreach. This paper will discuss the adaptations from the original projects to a one-semestercourse and to various outreach activities.Students enrolled at our university who are pre-calculus ready follow a three-course sequencethrough the first-year engineering program (COURSE numbers). As part of the ______ project,design modules were created in biomechanics, wind, and aquaculture for these courses (~200students). For the biomechanics module, students designed, built, and analyzed a prosthetic leg.They used a force plate to record the forces generated from a simple kicking motion. Students inthe wind turbine module built and analyzed a lab-scale wind turbine constructed from recycledmaterials for their first course and used 3-D modeling software to design turbine blades for asecond semester project. These blades were printed on a 3-D printer and attached to an existingstand for a performance analysis. In the aquaculture project, students designed, built, andanalyzed a small-scale aerator for an aquaculture facility in their first semester. In the secondsemester, students developed the layout of the facility and evaluated the current pumping system.Results from the initial implementation in the 2010-2011 academic year indicated that themajority of students recognized the engineering applications of these projects and enjoyed thebuilding and analysis components. All teams felt that they would like to see more of this type ofproject in their first-year engineering courses. The success of these projects motivated first-yearinstructors in the two-course, calculus-ready sequence (COURSE numbers) to implementportions of the projects. In August 2011, the co-PIs from the PROJECT hosted a workshop for the faculty and instructorsin the first-year engineering department. The workshop covered the aquaculture and wind turbineprojects from the pre-calculus courses and provided implementation recommendations for thecalculus sequence. The wind energy project was selected for implementation into the calculus-ready sequence. The general deliverables for the pre-calculus and calculus courses are listedbelow in Table 1. Most of the necessary adaptations involved integrating and combining thedesign activities from the two-course sequence into a single course. The original design projects,the integration aspects and challenge, and recommendations for further integration will bediscussed in the paper.For 9 of the 13 calculus –ready courses, instructors used the first four deliverables from theCourse 1 wind turbine project and the ethics analysis. The testing and analysis component of theproject was taken from the Course 2 project. During the testing of the wind turbine, a motiondetector recorded the blade position. The data set was filtered and analyzed using MATLAB.Table 1.

Final Report MemoThe wind energy and biomechanics projects greatly interested the University Outreach Office.The design and construction aspects of the two projects were used in summer outreach programsthat targeted underrepresented groups in engineering. Students in these programs had only tenhours to construct and analyze their designs. As such, modifications of the construction andtesting procedures were used from pre-calculus Course 1.During the summer outreach programs, middle and high school students constructed an artificiallimb using PVC piping for the “bones” and a knee joint using a variety of materials (hinges,paint rollers, etc.). Their designs were tested using a two-step method. The first test was to verifythat their design had the correct range of motion. They compared measurements from their ownlegs to the design using a goniometer. The next step was to determine the force exerted during akick as measured on a force plate and also using a soccer ball.Students building wind turbines had to create blades for an existing hub and stand. The bladeswere constructed from different materials (plastic bottles, paper maché, cardboard, etc.). Oncethe blades were installed, the students tested them using a photo tachometer to record RPMs anda multimeter to determine how much voltage was generated. The following paper will describethe projects, and include an assessment of the implementation process.","The paper discusses the adaptation of design modules from the ______ Project for first-year engineering courses and K-12 outreach programs, specifically focusing on three areas: biomechanics, wind energy, and aquaculture. Key points include the implementation of a biomechanics module where students designed and analyzed a prosthetic leg, measured forces during a kicking motion, and engaged in hands-on projects that highlighted engineering applications and increased student interest in practical design and analysis."
Using the Entrepreneurial Mindset to Master Kinematics and Human Body Motion in a Biomechanics Course,2020-09-08,,,,"Abstract Engineering analysis of the human body through kinematics and dynamic motion can be a challenging task that is daunting to undergraduate students. The analysis process starts by creating a framework of understanding in dynamics, calculus and anatomy and physiology. Most critically, students must develop a concrete knowledge of joint movement, gait and current technologies used to analyze human body motion characterized by locomotion or kinematics [1]. Students then must combine this knowledge with understanding of forces and muscle mechanics to understand how the body generates power or kinetics [2], all working succinctly to perform locomotion. By using a semester-long project to introduce engineers to the entrepreneurial mindset, students are given the chance to engage in difficult technical material in an impactful way while learning new skills not typically taught in the engineering classroom. A major key to the module's success was to allow students to choose their own topic, which allowed them to foster their curiosity and engage more genuinely with the content. Mavromatti et. al also demonstrated the importance of student-selected projects to help with motivation and personal interest with the subject matter [3]. Student feedback on the ability to select the project was observed: “I liked how we had freedom to decide what we wanted to do for our human performance project, it makes the work more fun and felt more like a personal success once it was done.” Above all, this demonstrated the ability of students to make deep connections with the course material, and finding value in their own curiosity driven biomechanics project. The module was designed to be a project based learning (PBL) application of human body motion. Students developed projects that used digital goniometers recorded by PowerLab in ADInstruments LabChart software (ADInstruments, Co, Colorado Springs CO), and video analysis for joint angle, position, veloicty and acceleration of body segments using Kinovea software (Open Source, Kinovea.org). Students designed their own study and executed an experimental setup for collecting human subject data and completed statistical analysis on the data. In addition to the technical content, students were required to think entrepreneurially to develop entrepreneurial minded learning (EML) skills. For project completion, they had to submit an IRB for human subject testing considering the ethical concerns of performing human subject testing. They completed a market analysis report, used scientific data to present technical content in an elevator pitch to stakeholders and delivered a non-technical brief to the CEO of their company. Engineers had to identify a reimbursement strategy to make human body motion data lucrative for their organization. The introduction of business content in a technical course provided an opportunity for engineers to learn how they could become a part of real-world business and organizational teams once they enter the workforce. The data collection tool, to assess the efficacy of this module, was comprised of a student survey delivered before the start of the project and at the conclusion of the work. Surveys were approved by the university's Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to their use. To maintain confidentiality, students were randomly assigned a 6-digit code that was used to pair responses on the pre- and post-module surveys. The surveys consisted of both short answer and multiple choice technical questions regarding the field of biomechanics, as well as 5-choice Likert-scale questions that prompted students to rate their current level of knowledge/ability regarding various EML skills. The greatest improvements in entrepreneurial skills was in investigating the market, and creating a preliminary business model with 94, and 154 increase on Likert-scores, respectively (Student’s t-test: pre- vs. post-survey, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, the student’s sense of ability at evaluating the technical feasibility, customer value and societal benefits or economic feasibility increased by 43% (p&lt;0.001). Students also improved on their ability to identify an opportunity, assess policy and regulatory issues, communicate engineering solutions in economic terms and validate market interest with 29, 44, 56 and 51% increase in Likert-scores, respectively (Student’s t-test: pre- and post-survey scores: p&lt;0.05). In general, the project was well received by the students and demonstrated improved awareness and ability to think with an entrepreneurial mindset. Keys to successful implementation of this module include providing a fast-paced curriculum in the first 6 weeks of class to get all students up to speed on core course material, the laboratory equipment and motion analysis technology, as well as thorough introduction to the project requirements. The faculty member had to be willing to research and develop competencies in several areas including sports performance, injury biomechanics, and clinical assessments of gait and human movement to provide technical feedback throughout the semester. Each project required individualized feedback for design of experiments, statistical analysis, experimental setup and scientific writing. To allow enough student-faculty interaction, the project was run during a 4-hour lab block that met weekly, and was associated with the biomechanics course. The students were given at least 6 weeks of open lab time to specifically work on the project. It was critical to provide rubrics, concrete deadlines and rapid feedback on deliverables throughout the semester to keep students on track and engaged with the material. Overall, students preferred this style of learning and found the project tremendously helpful in creating connections with the course content. This work could serve as a learning opportunity for professors trying to introduce entrepreneurship in a course with rigorous engineering content.","This paper discusses the integration of an entrepreneurial mindset into a biomechanics course focused on kinematics and human motion analysis. It highlights the effectiveness of project-based learning, where students selected their own topics, engaged in hands-on data collection using motion analysis technology, and developed entrepreneurial skills alongside technical knowledge, leading to improvements in their understanding of biomechanics and business concepts."
Development of a Video Analysis Software for Biomechanics Education,2020-09-08,,,,"Abstract A standard biomechanics course ought to cover both 1) tissue mechanics that requires a mechanical testing on biological tissue (in-vitro test) and 2) biomechanics of body motion that requires body motion analysis (in-vivo test). These requirements can lead to a significant financial investment in laboratory space, material testing machine, and motion analysis system. As a result, courses of biomechanics often result in a “chalk and board” lecture without hands-on experiments for students. To resolve the challenge confronting the expenses for biomechanics courses, we have modified the previously developed virtual mechanics laboratory (VML) software, which allows users to analyze digital video images captured from a moving body and/or deforming tissues, with a well-developed digital image analysis algorithm. Originally, VML was developed to as the supplemental virtual experimental tool for Dynamics and Mechanics of material courses. A new data matching module is created and added for the application of biomechanics education. In addition to the software modification, we have created new experiment protocols to achieve both mechanical testing on biological tissue and body motion analysis with the software. The VML software consists of following four modules: 1) Video edit module: User will be able edit the length of captured video to a proper length. 2) Dynamics module: User will be able to conduct motion/pixel tracking with an algorithm termed “Digital Image Correlation”. Measured data (displacement and angle change) can be exported as a EXCEL format data for analysis. 3) Mechanics of material module: User will be able to select a region of interest (ROI) in a video image (digital camera video or medical ultrasound video) captured from the deforming tissue. This module will evaluate the tissue deformation (strains). The measured data (strains) can be exported for analysis. 4) Data matching module: User will be able to match (synchronize) the data collected from different testing devices with a technique termed “least square correlation”. The data matching module makes the in-vivo analysis possible. For example, user can simultaneously video record 1) the body motion with a digital camera and 2) in-vivo tissue deformation with a medical ultrasound (B mode ultrasound video) at the time of experiment. Subsequently, user will be able to match two data deduced from two different modules, e.g. angle changes of a foot and tissue strain of Achilles tendon for further analysis. Following the development of VML software, three types of experiment protocols have been drafted. a). Motion analysis protocol: 1) Capture video images of the body motion with a digital camera. 2) Edit the video length in edit module and conduct motion tracking to evaluate the displacement/angle of body parts and export data. 3) Complete the motion analysis utilizing the collected data. b). In vitro tissue mechanical testing protocol: 1) Mount a tissue sample on the tester and capture a video image of a deforming tissue with a digital camera or an ultrasound. 2) Conduct ROI tracking to evaluate tissue deformation 3) Synchronize tissue deformation and applied-force recorded from tester and export data. 4) Evaluate tissue properties using collected data. c). In vivo tissue properties evaluation test protocol: 1) Capture a video image of a body motion to ultrasound image of a deforming tissue. 2) Conduct motion analysis and tissue deformation analysis by using dynamics and mechanical of material module. 3) Synchronize two data deduced in step 2) and export data. 4) Evaluate tissue properties. The VML software and the new experiment protocols will be tested in the brand-new biomechanics course at University of XXXXXX starting in Fall-semester 2020. Because Biomechanics course has never been offered at our university, the efficacy of new software and experiment protocols cannot be examined by conducting statistical analysis on grades of past and new students. Instead, we plan to 1) compare the scores of the quizzes administered at pre- (post- lecture) and post- laboratory and 2) conduct survey among students to check the efficacy of the VML software and experiment protocol.","This paper discusses the development of the Virtual Mechanics Laboratory (VML) software to enhance biomechanics education by providing a cost-effective solution for practical hands-on experiments in a standard biomechanics course. Key features of the software include modules for video editing, motion tracking, and tissue deformation analysis, along with new experimental protocols for in-vitro and in-vivo testing, aiming to improve the educational experience for students in biomechanics."
Clinical Observations of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Lesions in Patients with Chronic Fatigue,2020-09-03,,,,"Abstract Purpose To explore how chronic fatigue impacts on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion and observe related clinical characteristics. Methods A retrospective study conducted from December 2015 to December 2019, includes 86 males who involved chronic fatigue （determined by the fatigue self-assessment scale ）and present symptoms of knee pain with no trauma. For those who diagnosed with ACL lesion, we recorded their basic characteristics such as age, BMI（kg/m 2 ）, daily training time, etc. and carried out some tests on them to evaluate their clinical performance and observed their manifestations under X-ray, MRI and arthroscopy around the treatment procedure. Results Of all 86 males with ACL lesion, 59 patients were injured in the left knee while 27 in the right knee. Age, weekly training intensity, BMI, and knee hyperextension are independent influence factors for ACL lesion through multivariate analysis. Physical examinations and radiologic features included resting pain(23[26.7%]); standing pain(56[65.1%]); exercising pain(86[100%]); “powerless knee”(34[39.5%]); anterior patellar pain(41[47.7%]); knee axis tenderness(38[44.2%]); first degree positive in ADT test(34[39.5%]); second to third degree positive in ADT test(23[26.7%]); positive in Lachman test(73[84.9%]); positive in pivot shift test(5[5.8%]); ACL cyst(15[17.4%]); ACL thickness change(75[87.2%]); PCL tortuosity(35[40.7%]); synovitis(80[93.0%]); intra-articular effusion(79[91.9%]). Conclusion The main risk factor of ACL lesion is patients’ training experience time. Knee pain, mild anterior instability of knee joint, synovitis and intra-articular effusion are the most typical clinical manifestations of ACL patients.","This paper investigates the impact of chronic fatigue on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesions, focusing on clinical characteristics in a cohort of 86 male patients experiencing knee pain without trauma. Key findings indicate that training experience, BMI, and knee hyperextension are independent risk factors for ACL lesions, with common clinical manifestations including various types of knee pain and radiological signs such as synovitis and intra-articular effusion."
"Injury to the posterior cruciate ligament: biomechanics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of secondary osteoarthritis",2020-09-01,,,,"The literature was reviewed for reports on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).PCL is the largest intra-articular ligament in the knee joint and has good tensile mechanical properties.Optimal diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategies for PCL injury are discussed.Nonoperative treatment of isolated PCL injuries is associated with a significant risk of degeneration of the knee structures and impaired function.A comprehensive line of PCL reconstruction options are offered for the surgical approach to PCL reconstruction to restore functional joint stability in the knee.Literature data on protective effect of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate in the prevention of secondary knee osteoarthritis caused by PCL ruptures were reviewed.","This paper reviews the current understanding of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), focusing on its biomechanics, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and strategies to prevent secondary osteoarthritis following PCL injuries. Key findings emphasize the importance of timely and appropriate treatment, including a range of surgical approaches for reconstruction, to restore knee function and mitigate degeneration."
The conservative treatment of longstanding adductor-related groin pain syndrome: a critical and systematic review,2020-08-26,,,,"Longstanding (chronic) adductor-related groin pain syndrome is a widely common problem for athletes in many sports activities which often drastically reduces player activity and performance. The first choice in therapeutic treatment is conservative therapy. The objective of this study is to provide a systematic review regarding conservative treatment for longstanding adductor-related groin pain syndrome present in literature today. Furthermore, this study aims to give a critical vision of the current state of the art of the considered topic. After screening 234 articles, 19 studies following the inclusion criteria were included and summarized in this current systematic review and seven different types of therapeutic interventions were described. Compression clothing therapy, manual therapy together with strengthening exercise and prolotherapy were the therapeutic interventions which showed both the greatest level of strength of evidence (Moderate) and grade of recommendation (D). The remaining four types of therapeutic interventions i.e.: corticoid injection, platelet rich plasma therapy, intra-tissue percutaneous electrolysis and pulse-dose radiofrequency, showed both lower levels of strength of evidence (Conflicting) and grade of recommendation (C). In conclusion the literature available on the conservative treatment for longstanding adductor-related groin pain syndrome is limited and characterized by a low level of evidence. Therefore, our recommendation is to refer only to the few studies with higher level of evidence and at the same time to encourage further research in this area. The intervention showing the greater level of strength of evidence, and the greater grade of recommendation are compression clothing therapy, manual therapy and strengthening exercise, and prolotherapy. Other therapeutic interventions such as intra-tissue percutaneous electrolysis and pulse-dose radiofrequency seem promising but require further studies to confirm their efficacy.","This paper is a systematic review focusing on conservative treatments for longstanding adductor-related groin pain syndrome in athletes. It evaluates 19 studies, highlighting that interventions like compression clothing therapy, manual therapy with strengthening exercises, and prolotherapy have moderate evidence supporting their efficacy, while other methods require further investigation due to lower levels of evidence."
Biomechanical and metabolic aspects of backward (and forward) running on uphill gradients: another clue towards an almost inelastic rebound,2020-08-25,,,,"On level, the metabolic cost (C) of backward running is higher than forward running probably due to a lower elastic energy recoil. On positive gradient, the ability to store and release elastic energy is impaired in forward running. We studied running on level and on gradient to test the hypothesis that the higher metabolic cost and lower efficiency in backward than forward running was due to the impairment in the elastic energy utilisation.Eight subjects ran forward and backward on a treadmill on level and on gradient (from 0 to + 25%, with 5% step). The mechanical work, computed from kinematic data, C and efficiency (the ratio between total mechanical work and C) were calculated in each condition.Backward running C was higher than forward running at each condition (on average + 35%) and increased linearly with gradient. Total mechanical work was higher in forward running only at the steepest gradients, thus efficiency was lower in backward running at each gradient.Efficiency decreased by increasing gradient in both running modalities highlighting the impairment in the elastic contribution on positive gradient. The lower efficiency values calculated in backward running in all conditions pointed out that backward running was performed with an almost inelastic rebound; thus, muscles performed most of the mechanical work with a high metabolic cost. These new backward running C data permit, by applying the recently introduced 'equivalent slope' concept for running acceleration, to obtain the predictive equation of metabolic power during level backward running acceleration.","This paper investigates the metabolic costs and mechanical efficiency of backward versus forward running on various gradients, revealing that backward running is consistently more metabolically demanding. The study finds that efficiency decreases with increasing gradient for both modalities, highlighting the impaired ability to utilize elastic energy during backward running, which is characterized by a near inelastic rebound."
"Common Origin Tendon of the Biceps Femoris and Semitendinosus Muscles, Functional and Clinical Relevance",2020-08-25,,,,"The injury of Biceps Femoris long head (BFlh) and Semitendinosus (ST) is caused by over-stretch of the muscles at the back of the thigh. This condition encompasses almost one third of sports-related injuries and has severe consequences, such as pain and weakness of the muscles. This injury is related namely to quick and demanding activities, such as short distance sprinting in a limited time period. The Common Origin Tendon (COT) for these two muscles is affected in these injuries. This tendon is formed by the BFlh and ST muscles which together have a common origin in the ischial tuberosity. Given the lack of complete knowledge about the detailed structure of the COT, we dissected cadaveric limbs, describing their morphological characteristics, and discussing its functional and clinical implications.: Thirty-five human cadaveric lower limbs were dissected after fixation to analyze the morphology of the COT, focusing on their volume and muscular/tendinous proportion. We identified two subtypes of COT. The most frequent was the musculotendinous type, in which the origin of the BFlh was mainly tendinous, while the ST muscle was mainly muscular (91.4%). In the tendinous type both muscles had a tendinous origin (8.6%). In the musculotendinous type, the ST muscle ends with a microscopic connective tissue that extend into the ischial tuberosity. We conclude that there is a variability in the anatomical presentations of the COT, and we propose that this will correspond with biomechanical differences in the risks and the response to regional injuries. The connective tissue between the COT and the neighbouring structures could be a risk factor for adhesion tearing.","This paper investigates the anatomical variability of the Common Origin Tendon (COT) of the Biceps Femoris and Semitendinosus muscles and its clinical implications related to sports injuries. Through dissection of cadaveric limbs, the study identifies two subtypes of the COT, highlighting the functional significance of these variations in the context of injury risk and anatomical response in athletic activities."
Do knee abduction kinematics and kinetics predict future anterior cruciate ligament injury risk? A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies,2020-08-20,,,,"Abstract Background To systematically review the association between knee abduction kinematics and kinetics during weight-bearing activities at baseline and the risk of future anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. A search in the databases MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, EMBASE and Scopus was performed. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies including people of any age, assessing baseline knee abduction kinematics and/or kinetics during any weight-bearing activity for the lower extremity in individuals sustaining a future ACL injury and in those who did not. Results Nine articles were included in this review. Neither 3D knee abduction angle at initial contact (Mean diff: -1.68, 95%CI: − 4.49 to 1.14, ACL injury n = 66, controls n = 1369), peak 3D knee abduction angle (Mean diff: -2.17, 95%CI: − 7.22 to 2.89, ACL injury n = 25, controls n = 563), 2D peak knee abduction angle (Mean diff: -3.25, 95%CI: − 9.86 to 3.36, ACL injury n = 8, controls n = 302), 2D medial knee displacement (cm; Mean diff:: -0.19, 95%CI: − 0,96 to 0.38, ACL injury n = 72, controls n = 967) or peak knee abduction moment (Mean diff:-10.61, 95%CI: - 26.73 to 5.50, ACL injury n = 54, controls n = 1330) predicted future ACL injury. Conclusion Contrary to clinical opinion, our findings indicate that knee abduction kinematics and kinetics during weight-bearing activities may not be risk factors for future ACL injury. Knee abduction of greater magnitude than that observed in the included studies as well as factors other than knee abduction angle or moment, as possible screening measures for knee injury risk should be evaluated in future studies.","This paper systematically reviews the relationship between knee abduction kinematics and kinetics during weight-bearing activities and the risk of future anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The findings indicate that neither specific knee abduction angles nor moments effectively predict future ACL injury risk, suggesting the need to explore alternative risk factors and screening measures."
Perceptual-cognitive Function and Unplanned Athletic Movement Task Performance: A Systematic Review,2020-08-18,,,,"The performance of choice-reaction tasks during athletic movement has been demonstrated to evoke unfavorable lower limb biomechanics. However, the mechanism of this observation is unknown. We conducted a systematic review examining the association between 1) the biomechanical and functional safety of unplanned sports-related movements (e.g. jumps/runs with spontaneously indicated landing leg/cutting direction) and 2) markers of perceptual-cognitive function (PGF). A literature search in three databases (Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar) identified five relevant articles. Study quality, rated by means of a modified Downs &amp;amp; Black checklist, was moderate to high (average: 13.5/16 points). Four of five papers, in at least one parameter, found either an association of lower PGF and reduced task safety or significantly reduced task safety in low vs. high PGF performers. Yet, as a) the outcomes, populations and statistical methods of the included trials were highly heterogeneous and b) only two out of five studies had an adequate control condition (pre-planned movement task), evidence was classified as conflicting. In sum, PGF may represent a factor increasing injury risk during unplanned sports-related movements but future research strengthening the evidence of this association is warranted.","The paper conducts a systematic review to explore the relationship between perceptual-cognitive function (PGF) and the biomechanics of unplanned athletic movements, such as jumps and direction changes. It finds conflicting evidence regarding the association between lower PGF and increased injury risk during these movements, highlighting the need for further research to clarify these relationships."
Pediatric Obesity and Sports Medicine: A Narrative Review and Clinical Recommendations,2020-08-17,,,,"Objective: To review what is known about sports medicine and pediatric obesity, with a focus on injuries and MSK concerns. Data Sources: Systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed) for all years, using search combinations to best identify potential publications. Manuscripts were reviewed, summarized, and discussed in detail. Experienced clinicians in sports medicine and pediatric obesity reviewed the final searches for substantive content. Inclusion criteria include English language publications, children ≤18 years old, related to the practice of sports medicine and pediatric obesity. Publications excluded that dealt with non-sports medicine aspects of pediatric obesity, such as increasing physical activity or exercise, or the prevention or treatment of obesity. Main Results: Twenty-eight publications were included for review. Papers fell into 5 groupings: (1) MSK—increased incidence of MSK injury in children with obesity, hypothesized to be a result of changes in biomechanics; (2) weight management—gradual loss while maintaining proper hydration and nutrition for sports performance; (3) fitness/conditioning—children with overweight/obese showed decreased fitness measures and cardiopulmonary conditioning; (4) exertional heat illness—a concern for adolescent athletes with obesity, specifically in football; and (5) differential diagnoses—3 key differential diagnoses were identified for increased awareness: slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Blount's disease, and pes planus. Clinical topics pertinent to sports medicine and pediatric obesity were discussed. Conclusions: Sports medicine clinicians should be aware of the common MSK and sports-related conditions in children with obesity. Few studies have focused investigations on issues related to children with obesity participating in sports and other physical activities.","The paper reviews the intersection of sports medicine and pediatric obesity, emphasizing the increased incidence of musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries in children with obesity due to altered biomechanics, along with other health concerns such as fitness deficits and exertional heat illness. It highlights the need for sports medicine clinicians to be informed about specific MSK conditions and the limited research on obese children participating in sports."
Effects of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment on Sleep Quality in Student Athletes After Concussion: A Pilot Study,2020-08-11,,,,"Abstract Context Impaired sleep quality is among many symptoms observed in patients with a concussion and may predispose a patient to a prolonged recovery course and a later return to their daily activities. Studies have suggested that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may play a role in improving sleep quality. Objective To investigate how OMT may play a role in the management and overall healing process in patients with a concussion by improving sleep quality. Methods Data were collected from a randomized, controlled study on OMT and concussion (of which this study represents 1 arm) to investigate the effects of OMT vs concussion education counseling on sleep quality in student athletes with a concussion. Student athletes with no medical history of neurodegenerative disease who presented to the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine Academic Healthcare Center with a concussion following a sport-related injury were enrolled in the study. Participants received OMT intervention or standard counseling on how to care for a concussion during their first and second visits. Participants rated their symptoms, including sleep quality, on the validated scale Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5th Edition at 3 consecutive visits during 1 week. The mean sleep quality score within and between the OMT and education groups before each of 2 interventions and at the third visit were compared and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Thirty participants were enrolled in the study. Total symptom data showed a stronger, significant correlation with sleep scores than with other symptoms. Participants receiving OMT (n=16) reported overall 80% and 76% improvement in sleep quality from pre-OMT values to their second and third visits, respectively. Participants who had an educational intervention (n=14) reported a 36% and 46% improvement from pre-OMT values to their second and third visits, respectively. Conclusion The beneficial relationship trend between OMT and sleep quality in patients with a concussion was not statistically significant. Owing to the limitations of this study, further research with a larger population and sham control participants is warranted. (Clinicaltrials.gov No. NCT02750566)","This pilot study examines the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on sleep quality in student athletes recovering from concussions. The findings indicate that participants receiving OMT reported a significant improvement in sleep quality compared to those receiving standard counseling, suggesting a potential role for OMT in the management of concussion symptoms, though further research is needed to confirm these results."
Classifying Elite From Novice Athletes Using Simulated Wearable Sensor Data,2020-08-04,,,,"Movement screens are frequently used to identify differences in movement patterns such as pathological abnormalities or skill related differences in sport; however, abnormalities are often visually detected by a human assessor resulting in poor reliability. Therefore, our previous research has focused on the development of an objective movement assessment tool to classify elite and novice athletes' kinematic data using machine learning algorithms. Classifying elite and novice athletes can be beneficial to objectively detect differences in movement patterns between the athletes, which can then be used to provide higher quality feedback to athletes and their coaches. Currently, the method requires optical motion capture, which is expensive and time-consuming to use, creating a barrier for adoption within industry. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether machine learning could classify athletes as elite or novice using data that can be collected easily and inexpensively in the field using inertial measurement units (IMUs). A secondary purpose of this study was to refine the architecture of the tool to optimize classification rates. Motion capture data from 542 athletes performing seven dynamic screening movements were analyzed. A principal component analysis (PCA)-based pattern recognition technique and machine learning algorithms with the Euclidean norm of the segment linear accelerations and angular velocities as inputs were used to classify athletes based on skill level. Depending on the movement, using metrics achievable with IMUs and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA), 75.1-84.7% of athletes were accurately classified as elite or novice. We have provided evidence that suggests our objective, data-driven method can detect meaningful differences during a movement screening battery when using data that can be collected using IMUs, thus providing a large methodological advance as these can be collected in the field using sensors. This method offers an objective, inexpensive tool that can be easily implemented in the field to potentially enhance screening, assessment, and rehabilitation in sport and clinical settings.","This paper discusses the development of an objective movement assessment tool that utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify athletes as elite or novice based on kinematic data obtained from inertial measurement units (IMUs). The study demonstrates that this method can accurately classify skill levels while addressing the limitations of traditional optical motion capture, highlighting its potential for practical application in field settings for movement screening and rehabilitation."
Muscle force interacts with stature to influence functionally related polar second moments of area in the lower limb among adult women,2020-07-31,,,,"Abstract Objectives We sought to determine the relationships between muscle size, function, and polar second moments of area (J) at the midshaft femur, proximal tibia, and midshaft tibia. Materials and Methods We used peripheral quantitative computed tomography to quantify right femoral and tibial J and soft tissue cross‐sectional areas, and force plate mechanography to quantify peak power output and maximum force of the right limb, among athletic women and control subjects. Results Lower limb bone J exhibited strong relationships with estimated force but not power between both groups. Among controls, the strongest relationships between force and J were found at the midshaft femur. Among athletes, these relationships shifted to the tibia, regardless of body size, likely reflecting functional strain related to the major knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors. Together, muscle force and stature explained as much as 82 and 48% of the variance in lower limb bone J among controls and athletes, respectively. Discussion Results highlight the importance of considering relevant muscle function variables (e.g., force and lever arm lengths) when interpreting behavioral signatures from skeletal remains. Future work to improve the estimation of muscle force from skeletal remains, and incorporate it with lever arm length into analyses, is warranted. Results also suggest that, in doing so, functional relationships between a given section location and musculature should be considered.","This paper investigates the relationship between muscle size, function, and polar second moments of area in the lower limb among adult women. It finds significant correlations between muscle force and bone structure, particularly noting that muscle force and stature can explain a substantial variance in bone properties, emphasizing the need for incorporating muscle function variables in biomechanical analyses."
Recreational Sports and Intra-articular Hip Injuries in Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroscopy for Femoroacetabular Impingement,2020-07-29,,,,"We aimed to determine the relationship between recreational sports and intra-articular hip injuries in an active population that had undergone hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.A retrospective review was performed of prospectively collected data from patients undergoing hip arthroscopy between January 2015 and December 2016. Inclusion criteria included patients between 18 and 50 years of age who had participated in recreational sports prior to surgery and had a minimum of a 2-year follow-up. Labral injury was evaluated using the Multicenter Arthroscopic Hip Outcome Research Network classification, and rim chondral injuries were evaluated using the Acetabular Labral Articular Disruptions system. Ligamentum teres tear and psoas impingement were also recorded. Sports were classified as rotational running (soccer, basketball, handball), flexibility (martial arts, dance), asymmetric-overhead (racquet), or endurance (running, swimming, cycling). Primary univariate analysis of sports' independent associations, demographic characteristics, intra-articular hip injuries, and outcomes was performed.Patients included 185 people with a mean age of 36.7 years. Patients participating in rotational running sports and flexibility sports had a significantly greater proportion of rim chondral injuries than those participating in endurance sports or asymmetric overhead sports (P = 0.02). Ligamentum teres tears were significantly associated with flexibility sports (P < 0.001). A total of 84.7%, 67.7%, 67.2%, and 71.2% of patients met minimal clinically important difference levels for the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), the Hip Outcome Score (HOS)10 questionnaire with activities of daily living (HOS-ADL), the sports subscale (HOS-SSS), and the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), respectively; 94.9%, 66.2% and 62.7% met the patient acceptable symptom state for mHHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS, respectively; 86.7%, 48.5%, 47.8%, and 32.4% found substantial clinical benefit for mHHS, HOS-ADL, HOS-SSS, and iHOT-12, respectively.Rotational running sports were significantly associated with rim chondral injuries. Flexibility sports were significantly associated with rim chondral injuries and ligamentum teres tears. Athletes participating in these sports are more likely to have intra-articular hip injuries than those in the other sports categories.Level IV, prognostic case series.","The paper investigates the relationship between recreational sports and intra-articular hip injuries in individuals undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement. It highlights that participants in rotational running and flexibility sports are significantly more prone to specific hip injuries, particularly rim chondral injuries and ligamentum teres tears, compared to those engaged in endurance or asymmetric overhead sports."
Sex Differences In Lower Extremity Kinematics During Overhead And Single Leg Squat Tests,2020-07-01,,,,"The Overhead Squat (OHS) and Single-Leg Squat (SLS) are two clinical tests commonly used by sports medicine practitioners to identify high-risk biomechanical movement patterns. Traditional scoring of these tests requires subjective judgement whereas new technology has allowed for automatic scoring and additional objective data. To date, few studies have examined sex differences in OHS and SLS performance and none measured with a marker-less motion capture system. PURPOSE: To determine if biomechanical differences exist between male and female collegiate athletes during performance of an OHS and SLS. METHODS: 75 female (18.1±0.4y; 166.9±6.5cm; 64.1±10.2kg) and 58 male (18.7±1.2y; 184.4±7.1cm; 86.9±15.2kg) collegiate athletes completed OHS and SLS testing as part of their pre-participation exam. Men’s sports included football (n=24), baseball (n=19), lacrosse (n=10), and swimming (n=5); women’s sports included track and field (n=23), field hockey (n=12), softball (n=12), lacrosse (n=9), swimming (n=7), soccer (n=6), golf (n=3), tennis (n=2), and gymnastics (n=1). Participants completed 4 OHSs followed by 4 SLSs on each leg. A Microsoft Kinect sensor using Athletic Movement Assessment software (PhysiMax®) was used to measure all kinematic variables. Differences between males and females were assessed with independent t-tests. RESULTS: For the OHS, males displayed greater peak knee varus (M: 25.7°±9.6°, F: 19.8°±8.2°; P<0.001), peak hip flexion (M: -93.6°±-14.41°, F: -86.9°±-14.5°; P<0.05), and peak trunk flexion angles (M: 11.5°±10.9°, F: 6.3°±9.2°; P<0.01). Females displayed greater peak ankle dorsiflexion angles (F: -28.7°±-5.8°, M: -26.5°±-6.3°; P<0.05). For the SLS (dominant limb), males displayed greater peak trunk flexion (M: 32.2°±5.6°, F: 27.6°±6.6°; P <0.001) and lateral pelvic angles (M: 4.2°±3.9°, F: 2.9°±2.7°; P<0.05). For the non-dominant limb, females displayed greater peak knee valgus angles (F: -12.5°±-9.1°, M: -8.9°±-9.1°; P<0.05) whereas males displayed greater peak trunk flexion angles (M: 31.7°±5.5°, F: 27.5°±6.9°; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Male and female collegiate athletes displayed different movement strategies during performance of an OHS and SLS. Injury prevention programs may need to target sex-specific biomechanical patterns to improve movement capacity.","This paper investigates sex differences in lower extremity kinematics during Overhead Squat (OHS) and Single-Leg Squat (SLS) tests among collegiate athletes, utilizing a marker-less motion capture system. The findings indicate distinct biomechanical movement patterns between male and female athletes, suggesting the need for tailored injury prevention programs that address these sex-specific differences."
Lower Limb Asymmetry After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Adolescent Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020-06-30,,,,"Objectives To identify reported (1) common biomechanical asymmetries in the literature after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in adolescents during landing and (2) timescales for asymmetry to persist postsurgery. Data Sources We identified sources by searching the CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus electronic databases using the following search terms: asymmetry OR symmetry AND landing AND biomechanics OR kinematics OR kinetics. Study Selection We screened the titles and abstracts of 85 articles using our inclusion criteria. A total of 13 articles were selected for further analysis. Data Extraction Three reviewers independently assessed the methodologic quality of each study. We extracted the effect sizes directly from studies or calculated them for biomechanical variables assessing asymmetry between limbs of participants with ACL reconstruction. We conducted meta-analyses on variables that were assessed in multiple studies for both double- and single-limb landings. Data Synthesis Asymmetry was more commonly identified in kinetic than kinematic variables. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction appeared to have a large effect on asymmetry between limbs for peak vertical ground reaction force, peak knee-extension moment, and loading rate during double-limb landings, as well as mean knee-extension moment and knee energy absorption during both double- and single-limb landings. Conclusions Our findings suggested that return-to-sport criteria after ACL reconstruction should incorporate analysis of the asymmetry in loading experienced by each limb rather than movement patterns alone.","This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess biomechanical asymmetries in adolescent athletes following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, focusing on landing mechanics. It finds that asymmetries, particularly in kinetic variables, are prevalent post-surgery and emphasizes the importance of evaluating limb loading asymmetry in return-to-sport criteria."
Mechanical and Material Tendon Properties in Patients With Proximal Patellar Tendinopathy,2020-06-24,,,,"The effect of chronic patellar tendinopathy on tissue function and integrity is currently unclear and underinvestigated. The aim of this cohort comparison was to examine morphological, material, and mechanical properties of the patellar tendon and to extend earlier findings by measuring the ability to store and return elastic energy in symptomatic tendons.Seventeen patients with chronic (>3 months, VISA-P < 80), inferior pole patellar tendinopathy (24 ± 4 years; male = 12, female = 5) were carefully matched to controls (25 ± 3 years) for training status, pattern, and history of loading of the patellar tendon. Individual knee extension force, patellar tendon stiffness, stress, strain, Young's modulus, hysteresis, and energy storage capacity, were obtained with combined dynamometry, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyography.Anthropometric parameters did not differ between groups. VISA-P scores ranged from 28 to 78 points, and symptoms had lasted from 10 to 120 months before testing. Tendon proximal cross-sectional area was 61% larger in the patellar tendinopathy group than in the control group. There were no differences between groups in maximal voluntary isometric knee extension torque (p = 0.216; d < -0.31) nor in tensile tendon force produced during isometric ramp contractions (p = 0.185; d < -0.34). Similarly, tendon strain (p = 0.634; d < 0.12), hysteresis (p = 0.461; d < 0.18), and strain energy storage (p = 0.656; d < 0.36) did not differ between groups. However, patellar tendon stiffness (-19%; p = 0.007; d < -0.74), stress (-27%; p< 0.002; d < -0.90) and Young's modulus (-32%; p = 0.001; d < -0.94) were significantly lower in tendinopathic patients compared to healthy controls.In this study, we observed lower stiffness in affected tendons. However, despite the substantial structural and histological changes occurring with tendinopathy, the tendon capacity to store and dissipate energy did not differ significantly.","This paper investigates the mechanical and material properties of the patellar tendon in patients with chronic proximal patellar tendinopathy, comparing them to healthy controls. Key findings include lower stiffness, stress, and Young's modulus in affected tendons, while the ability to store and return elastic energy remained similar between groups, highlighting the complexities of tendon function in tendinopathy."
Features Observed Using Multiple Inertial Sensors for Running Track and Hard-Soft Sand Running: A Comparison Study,2020-06-15,,,,"Variability in the running surface can cause an athlete to alter their gait. Most literature report running on grass, a treadmill or athletics running tracks using inertial sensors. This study compares the signals obtained by 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) inertial-magnetic sensors incorporating an accelerometer (±16 g), gyroscope (±2000°/s) and magnetometer (±8 gauss). The sensors were placed on the participant's shank, knee, lower spine and upper spine, and the participants were asked to run on three different surfaces (running track, hard sand and soft sand). The calculated player loads for a 400 m run on each surface type was very similar. The mean and standard deviation values were 577 ± 130, 581 ± 128, 568 ± 124 for soft sand, hard sand and the running track, respectively. This did not correlate with the participant's self-assessment RPE (Rate of perceived exertion), which demonstrated running on soft sand to be significantly more challenging, yielding a mean and standard deviation of 5.3 ± 2.5 (Hard to Very Hard). Soft sand running had a decreased swing time duration but increased variability (0.44 ± 0.02 s—Swing Time, 6.5 ± 1.1%—CV), hard sand running had the longest swing and intermediate variability duration (0.46 ± 0.02 s—Swing Time, 3.30 ± 2.58 %—CV) and running track running had the medium swing time but lowest variability (0.45 ± 0.02 s, 2.7 ± 0.9%—CV). Gait dominance was not consistent across the surfaces for each participant and remained below a ratio of 0.4. These results provide an insight into how athletes modify their gait mechanics to accommodate different running surfaces.","This study investigates how running on different surfaces—running track, hard sand, and soft sand—affects athletes' gait mechanics and perceived exertion. Using 9 degrees of freedom inertial sensors, the research reveals that while player loads are similar across surfaces, participants reported greater difficulty running on soft sand, which also exhibited altered swing time and variability in gait."
Assessing Technical Skills in Talented Youth Athletes: A Systematic Review,2020-06-03,,,,"Abstract Background Talent identification and development (TID) programs aim to identify players with the greatest potential for long-term success. Previous research suggests that the assessment of sport-specific technical skills is valuable for discriminating between more and less skilled individuals and/or for predicting future performance. Objective This review aims to provide an overview on both the instruments used to assess sport-specific technical skills and their discriminatory, explanatory and/or predictive findings in the context of TID. Methods Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Knowledge, SPORTDiscus, SURF and Scopus (January 1990–October 2019). Search terms covered the areas of sport, technical skills assessment, performance, skill level and youth. In the end, 59 relevant studies were identified and evaluated. Results The results highlight the widespread and important role of technical skills in TID; almost all studies (93%) reported discriminatory, explanatory and/or predictive benefits for the assessment of sport-specific technical skills. Analyzing and categorizing the number of assessment methods applied in the studies ( n = 69) according to their method type (‘technique-related’ or ‘outcome-related’ variables) and method set-up (‘experimental’ or ‘competition’ data acquisition environment) indicated a clear tendency towards ‘outcome-related’ (73%) and ‘experimental’ (75%) assessment methods. We also found a strong overrepresentation of studies assessing cross-sectional data (75%) in soccer (53%) in male samples (74% of studies reporting subjects’ sex) from European countries (64%). Conclusions On the one hand, our findings demonstrate the great capability of sport-specific technical skills assessments to discriminate different performance levels and predict future performance in TID activities. On the other hand, this review highlights the focus on ‘outcome-related’ and ‘experimental’ methods in specific populations and, consequently, the limited knowledge in other areas. Here, the application of ‘technique-related’ and ‘competition’ methods appears promising for adding new knowledge, especially in the light of technological advances.","This systematic review examines the assessment of sport-specific technical skills in talent identification and development (TID) programs for youth athletes. It highlights 59 studies demonstrating that these assessments effectively discriminate skill levels and predict future performance, while also noting a predominance of outcome-related and experimental assessment methods in soccer, particularly among male subjects from European countries, indicating a gap in knowledge in other assessment areas."
Bracing versus non-bracing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery,2020-06-01,,,,"Background and objectives: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a common procedure which can allow patients to return to their active lifestyle. Knee braces have been prescribed frequently to protect the anterior cruciate ligament graft after reconstruction. The aim of this study was to see the effect of postoperative bracing with non-bracing after one year follow-up. Methods: Thirty consecutive patients with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture were reconstructed. The first 15 patients were supplied postoperatively with a knee brace for 6 weeks. The next 15 patients were not supplied with a brace. The follow-up was based on the Lysholm functional score, Tegner activity level, manual Lachman test and pain by visual analog scale, each variable were recorded before surgery, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and one year after the surgery. Results: After one year follow up, the results of this study showed no statistically significant differences between the brace and non-brace groups with regard to Lysholm score (mean with brace was 87.26, with- out brace was 87.80), Tegner activity level (mean with brace was 6.26, without brace was 6.40 ) and manual Lachman test; however, the pain score was less with brace group in the short term follow up (at 12th postoperative week) but no statistically significant differences was found between the groups after 1 year follow up. Conclusions: Weather using functional brace or not after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction depends on the orthopedic surgeon and the psychology and pain threshold of the patient.","This study investigates the effects of postoperative bracing compared to non-bracing in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The findings indicate no significant differences in functional outcomes or activity levels between the two groups one year post-surgery, though the brace group reported lower pain levels in the early postoperative period."
Navigating the Complex Pathway of Youth Athletic Development: Challenges and Solutions to Managing the Training Load of Youth Team Sport Athletes,2020-05-19,,,,"ABSTRACT The development of a youth team sport athlete is a complex process. This article outlines challenges that may restrict the optimal balance between training and recovery and provide solutions to help practitioners overcome these challenges. To facilitate positive youth athletic development, training aims must be aligned between stakeholders to synchronize periods of intensified training and recovery. Within- and between-athlete variations in weekly training load must be managed and practitioners should attempt to ensure the intended load of training equals the load perceived by the athlete. Furthermore, practitioners should be cognizant of the athletes' nonsport-related stressors to enable both academic and sporting pursuits. Although each of these challenges adds intricacy, they may be overcome through collaboration, monitoring, and, if necessary, the modification of the athletes' training load.","This paper discusses the complexities involved in the development of youth team sport athletes, emphasizing the importance of balancing training and recovery. It highlights key challenges in managing training loads and suggests collaborative solutions to align training goals among stakeholders, while also considering athletes' non-sport-related stressors."
Changes of Material Elastic Properties during Healing of Ruptured Achilles Tendons Measured with Shear Wave Elastography: A Pilot Study,2020-05-12,,,,"Therapy options for ruptured Achilles tendons need to take into account the right balance of timing, amount and intensity of loading to ensure a sufficient biomechanical resilience of the healing tendon on the one hand, and to enable an adequate tensile stimulus on the other hand. However, biomechanical data of human Achilles tendons after rupture during the separate healing stages are unknown. Shear wave elastography is an ultrasound technique that measures material elastic properties non-invasively, and was proven to have a very good correlation to biomechanical studies. Taking advantage of this technology, 12 patients who suffered from an acute Achilles tendon rupture were acquired and monitored through the course of one year after rupture. Nine of these patients were treated non-operatively and were included for the analysis of biomechanical behaviour. A significant increase of material elastic properties was observed within the first six weeks after trauma (up to 80% of baseline value), where it reached a plateau phase. A second significant increase occurred three to six months after injury. This pilot study suggests a time correlation of biomechanical properties with the biological healing phases of tendon tissue. In the reparative phase, a substantial amount of biomechanical resilience is restored already, but the final stage of biomechanical stability is reached in the maturation phase. These findings can potentially be implemented into treatment and aftercare protocols.","The paper investigates the changes in material elastic properties of ruptured Achilles tendons during the healing process using shear wave elastography. Key findings indicate a significant increase in elasticity within the first six weeks post-injury and further improvements three to six months later, highlighting a correlation between biomechanical properties and the biological healing phases, which could inform treatment protocols."
Head Impact Telemetry System’s Video-based Impact Detection and Location Accuracy,2020-04-22,,,,"ABSTRACT Purpose This study aimed to quantify the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System’s impact detection and location measurement accuracy using an impact biomechanics data set paired with video of high school football special teams plays. Methods The head impact biomechanics data set and video were collected from 22 high school football players, wearing HIT System instrumented helmets, competing in 218 special teams plays over a single high school football season. We used two separate video analysis approaches. To quantify the impact detection accuracy, we evaluated the video for head impacts independently of the impact data collection triggers collected by the HIT System. Video-observed impacts matched to valid and invalid head impacts by the HIT System algorithm were categorized as true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. To quantify impact location accuracy, we analyzed video-synchronized head impacts for impact location independent of the HIT System’s impact location measurement and quantified the estimated percent agreement of impact location between the HIT System recorded impact location and the impact location observed on video. Results The HIT System’s impact-filtering algorithm had 69% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 70% accuracy in categorizing true and non–head impact data collection triggers. The HIT System agreed with video-observed impact locations on 64% of the 129 impacts we analyzed (unweighted k = 0.43, 95% confidence interval = 0.31–0.54). Conclusion This work provides data on the HIT System’s impact detection and location accuracy during high school football special teams plays using game video analysis that has not been previously published. Based on our data, we believe that the HIT System is useful for estimating population-based impact location distributions for special teams plays.","This study evaluates the accuracy of the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System in detecting and locating impacts during high school football special teams plays using video analysis of collected biomechanics data. Results indicate that while the HIT System demonstrated moderate sensitivity and specificity in impact detection, it achieved 64% agreement in impact location accuracy when compared to video observations."
The Effect of Training Experience and Leg Dominance on the Prevalence of Asymptomatic Intraarticular Changes of the Knee Joints in Adult Professional Male Soccer Players,2020-04-19,,,,"Abstract Background Currently, no data is available regarding the association between professional experience or limb dominance and the prevalence of asymptomatic knee joint lesions in adult professional male soccer players. Hypothesis The prevalence of the accumulated changes increases with training experience. This is especially true for the dominant leg, which is involved in a large proportion of the athletes’ movements. Study Design Level 2 cross-sectional cohort study Methods MRI was used to assess the condition of 94 knee joints in 47 adult professional male soccer players (mean age 25.7 ± 4.6 years, BMI 22.8 ± 1.4). Previous surgery on joints was an exclusion criterion. No football player had knee injuries (including fresh bruises) for at least 3 months before the examination. All the scans were performed using a 1.5T MRI scanner and a slice thickness of 3 mm. The images were blindly analyzed by two experienced radiologists. We analyzed all the three compartments of the knee joint. We consider a chondral lesion already from grade I in modified Noyes and Stabler classification system. To assess the influence of soccer training experience, all players were divided into two groups: group 1 formed from players with less than 20 years of experience and group 2 with more than 20 years of experience. Results One hundred percent of the soccer players had at least one chondral and meniscal lesion. In both legs, the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (95.6%) was the most frequent site of injury. Most of the injuries were classified as grade II injuries (73.3% for the dominant and 75.6% for the non-dominant leg). Experience and age of the athletes significantly increased the probability of subcortical bone lesions. They were significantly positively correlated with the grades of patellar lesions and lesions of the patellar surface of the femur and significantly negatively correlated with the grades of lesions of posterior horn of lateral meniscus and anterior horn of medial meniscus. No statistically significant differences in the prevalence and grades of cartilage and meniscal lesions in the dominant and non-dominant limb were observed. Conclusion Soccer practice is associated with the increased prevalence of asymptomatic chondral and meniscal lesions. The probability of subcortical bone lesions significantly increases with training experience and age. These factors are also positively correlated with the grades of patellar lesions and lesions of the patellar surface of the femur. The prevalence and grade of asymptomatic chondral and meniscal lesions is independent of leg dominance.","This paper investigates the prevalence of asymptomatic knee joint lesions in adult male professional soccer players, focusing on the impact of training experience and leg dominance. It finds that all players have at least one chondral or meniscal lesion, with training experience and age significantly increasing the likelihood of subcortical bone lesions, while the prevalence and severity of these lesions are independent of limb dominance."
Predicting Concussion Outcome by Integrating Finite Element Modeling and Network Analysis,2020-04-15,,,,"Concussion is a significant public health problem affecting 1.6-2.4 million Americans annually. An alternative to reducing the burden of concussion is to reduce its incidence with improved protective equipment and injury mitigation systems. Finite element (FE) models of the brain response to blunt trauma are often used to estimate injury potential and can lead to improved helmet designs. However, these models have yet to incorporate how the patterns of brain connectivity disruption after impact affects the relay of information in the injured brain. Furthermore, FE brain models typically do not consider the differences in individual brain structural connectivities and their purported role in concussion risk. Here, we use graph theory techniques to integrate brain deformations predicted from FE modeling with measurements of network efficiency to identify brain regions whose connectivity characteristics may influence concussion risk. We computed maximum principal strain in 129 brain regions using head kinematics measured from 53 professional football impact reconstructions that included concussive and non-concussive cases. In parallel, using diffusion spectrum imaging data from 30 healthy subjects, we simulated structural lesioning of each of the same 129 brain regions. We simulated lesioning by removing each region one at a time along with all its connections. In turn, we computed the resultant change in global efficiency to identify regions important for network communication. We found that brain regions that deformed the most during an impact did not overlap with regions most important for network communication (Pearson's correlation, ρ = 0.07; p = 0.45). Despite this dissimilarity, we found that predicting concussion incidence was equally accurate when considering either areas of high strain or of high importance to global efficiency. Interestingly, accuracy for concussion prediction varied considerably across the 30 healthy connectomes. These results suggest that individual network structure is an important confounding variable in concussion prediction and that further investigation of its role may improve concussion prediction and lead to the development of more effective protective equipment.","The paper investigates concussion prediction by integrating finite element modeling with network analysis of brain connectivity. It highlights that while regions most deformed during impacts do not coincide with those crucial for network communication, individual differences in brain connectivity significantly influence concussion risk and predictive accuracy, suggesting a need for improved protective gear based on these insights."
Relationship between length of leg and strength of leg muscle to frequency of straight kicks,2020-03-18,,,,"To be able to increase kick frequency requires anthropometric factors and adequate physical conditions. Anthropometry that is very important is the length of the leg and a very important physical condition is the strength of the leg muscles. For this reason, the length of leg and strength of leg muscles which is related to the frequency of straight kicks need further investigation. This study aims to determine the relationship between the length of the leg and strength of leg muscle to the frequency of straight kicks. This research is a correlation study with data collection using tests and measurements. The population of this research is 70 male pencak silat at Junior High School of PGRI-1. From this population, 33 peoples were chosen by random sample selection. The test is a measurement of leg length using an antrophometer (cm). Measurement of leg muscle strength with leg dynamometer (kg), and frequency of straight kick measurement using a hand box and stopwatch by measuring the number of kicks in one minute. Data analysis was performed using Pearson correlation and multiples regression.","This paper investigates the relationship between leg length and leg muscle strength and their effects on the frequency of straight kicks in male pencak silat participants.

Irrational beliefs and choking under pressure: A preliminary investigation,2020-03-03,,,,"Researchers who examine existing models of choking under pressure are beginning to explore the antecedents that predispose individuals to increased anxiety. Irrational beliefs (IBs) may be one such antecedent to ""choking"", given that irrational beliefs are closely associated with anxiety intensity. This study aimed to investigate whether IBs influenced anxiety and performance under pressure. Experienced Australian football players (N = 35) completed an IBs questionnaire prior to an Australian football set shot experiment with low- and high-pressure. During both pressure conditions, participants completed a state anxiety questionnaire prior to completing 15 set shots on goal. Results indicated that cognitive and somatic anxiety increased from low- to high-pressure. For somatic anxiety, an IBs main effect approached significance, indicating higher somatic anxiety with increases in IBs. A marginally significant Condition main effect was found for performance, which decreased from low- to high-pressure, with no other effects for performance evident. Follow-up correlation analysis of seven athletes who likely experienced choking (i.e., greater than 15-point performance decrease) indicated a strong negative correlation between IBs and change in performance from low- to high-pressure. Further analyses for ""chokers"" indicated a significant IBs × Condition interaction, with performance tending to increase with increasing IBs under low-pressure and decrease with increasing IBs under high-pressure. This study provides initial, tentative support that IBs associated with performance trends of ""chokers"" under different pressure conditions may be dissimilar to those of ""underperformers"" or ""clutch"" performers. Applied implications for sport psychologists working with athletes are discussed.Lay summary: This paper investigated whether inflexible thoughts (i.e., irrational beliefs- IBs) led to increased anxiety and ""choking"". Athletes completed an IBs questionnaire, then an anxiety survey during a football kicking task under low- and high-pressure. Results indicated IBs may affect ""chokers"" response to pressure differently to other groups.","This paper explores the relationship between irrational beliefs (IBs) and anxiety in athletes facing pressure, specifically investigating their influence on performance in Australian football set shots. Results suggest that IBs contribute to increased somatic anxiety under high-pressure conditions and may distinctly affect ""chokers"" compared to other performers, highlighting potential implications for sport psychology."
Lower-Limb Biomechanics in Football Players with and without Hip-related Pain,2020-02-20,,,,"ABSTRACT Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the differences in lower-limb biomechanics between adult subelite competitive football players with and without hip-related pain during two contrasting tasks—walking and single-leg drop jump (SLDJ)—and to determine whether potential differences, if present, are sex dependent. Methods Eighty-eight football players with hip-related pain (23 women, 65 men) and 30 asymptomatic control football players (13 women, 17 men) who were currently participating in competitive sport were recruited. Biomechanical data were collected for the stance phase of walking and SLDJ. Pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle angles, as well as the impulse of the external joint moments, were calculated. Differences between groups and sex-specific effects were calculated using linear regression models. Results Compared with their asymptomatic counterparts, football players with hip-related pain displayed a lower average pelvic drop angle during walking ( P = 0.03) and a greater average pelvic hike angle during SLDJ ( P &lt; 0.05). Men with hip-related pain displayed a smaller total range of motion (excursion) for the transverse plane pelvis angle ( P = 0.03) and a smaller impulse of the hip external rotation moment ( P &lt; 0.01) during walking compared with asymptomatic men. Women with hip-related pain displayed a greater total range of motion (excursion) for the sagittal plane knee angle ( P = 0.01) during walking compared with asymptomatic women. Conclusion Overall, few differences were observed in lower-limb biomechanics between football players with and without hip-related pain, irrespective of the task. This outcome suggests that, despite the presence of symptoms, impairments in lower-limb biomechanics during function do not appear to be a prominent feature of people with hip-related pain who are still participating in sport.","This study investigates the differences in lower-limb biomechanics between competitive football players with hip-related pain and asymptomatic controls during walking and a single-leg drop jump task. The findings indicate minimal differences in biomechanics regardless of the presence of pain, suggesting that lower-limb biomechanical impairments may not be a significant feature for those actively participating in sport."
The Psychological Parameters of Athletic Injuries in Female Collegiate Athletes,2020-02-01,,,,"The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a difference in the psychological parameters of life stress and anxiety as risk factors to injury.Methods: Participants in this study are female athletes [n=51, (36 injured, 15 non-injured)] from four various sports teams (basketball, golf, soccer, and softball) at an NCAA Division I college.The participants completed four different questionnaires: an injury report, the Life Events Coping Scale for Collegiate Athletes (LESCA), the Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT).Results: Results indicated that injured athletes experienced more life stress than non-injured athletes and this difference was statistically significant.Results also showed that in personality competitive anxiety and sport competitive anxiety, non-injured athletes have lower anxiety than injured athletes.Conclusion: This study sought to examine the differences in injured and non-injured athletes between psychological parameters that may lead to injury.The difference in life events between injured and non-injured athletes was statistically significant while the difference in personality competitive anxiety and sport competitive anxiety was not statistically significant.","This study investigates the psychological factors, specifically life stress and anxiety, as potential risk factors for injuries among female collegiate athletes. Findings reveal that injured athletes report significantly higher levels of life stress compared to non-injured athletes, but differences in competitive anxiety levels were not statistically significant."
A novel repetitive head impact exposure measurement tool differentiates player position in National Football League,2020-01-28,,,,"Abstract American-style football participation poses a high risk of repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure leading to acute and chronic brain injury. The complex nature of symptom expression, human predisposition, and neurological consequences of RHI limits our understanding of what constitutes as an injurious impact affecting the integrity of brain tissue. Video footage of professional football games was reviewed and documentation made of all head contact. Frequency of impact, tissue strain magnitude, and time interval between impacts was used to quantify RHI exposure, specific to player field position. Differences in exposure characteristics were found between eight different positions; where three unique profiles can be observed. Exposure profiles provide interpretation of the relationship between the traumatic event(s) and how tissue injury is manifested and expressed. This study illustrates and captures an objective measurement of RHI on the field, a critical component in guiding public policy and guidelines for managing exposure.","The paper presents a novel tool for measuring repetitive head impact exposure in American football, focusing on how these impacts differ by player position. It identifies three distinct exposure profiles that link the frequency and magnitude of head impacts to potential brain injury, providing critical data for public policy and safety guidelines."
Identification of internal loads at the selected joints during performance of a backward somersault,2020-01-22,,,,"A backward tucked somersault from the standing position is analyzed in this study.The used computations were based on a three-dimensional model of the human body defined in natural coordinates.The net torques and internal reactions occurring at the ankle, knee, hip, upper trunk-neck and neck-head joints were obtained by inverse dynamics.The achieved results confirmed the significant loads at the joints at the beginning of the landing phase and revealed the way the analyzed stunt was controlled.It was also shown that the natural coordinates provide a useful environment for modeling spatial biomechanical structures.",The paper analyzes the internal loads experienced at various joints during the execution of a backward tucked somersault using a three-dimensional model of the human body. Key findings indicate significant joint loads at the landing phase and highlight the effectiveness of natural coordinates for modeling spatial biomechanical structures.
Identifying Muscle Strength Imbalances in Athletes using Motion Analysis Incorporated with Sensory Inputs,2020-01-01,,,,"Movement analysis is one of the commonly used methods in the context of physiotherapy to identify dysfunctions in the human musculoskeletal system. The overhead squat is a popular movement pattern that is also approved by NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine of USA) among the various movement patterns that are used to identify muscle dysfunctions. It is commonly used to draw conclusions on an athlete's muscle imbalance in the clinical field based on observed compensations of the movement pattern. It is used by trainers as well as fitness enthusiasts to routinely assess their movement patterns. The correct execution of movements in every athlete is crucial since the incorrect bio-mechanics can result in injuries that would take a considerable amount of time to recover through rehabilitation. Thus, there is a need to evaluate injury risks accurately. The primary purpose of this research is to propose a method of detecting muscle imbalances in collegiate athletes with the aid of a low-cost motion tracking device. This proposed method facilitates the detection of muscle imbalances in both upper-body as well as lower-body during the execution of the overhead squat.","The paper focuses on identifying muscle strength imbalances in collegiate athletes through the use of motion analysis combined with sensory inputs, specifically evaluating the overhead squat movement pattern. It highlights the significance of accurate movement assessment to detect upper- and lower-body muscle imbalances and potential injury risks associated with improper biomechanics."
Spine Injuries in Sport,2020-01-01,,,,"The energy that is transferred through the collisions that occur in sports has the result of a number of critically harmed players every year. In the studies that have been made regarding to contact and noncontact sports it was showed that the most of sport related injuries of the spine are both soft-tissue injuries and self-limiting. The athletic injuries of the spine in a limited quantity have the outcome of significant neurological compromise. The result that appears after a soft tissue injury is the immobilization and the decrease of the performance. In the category of sports that are reported as „collision sports” are encountered the following: football, wrestling, and boxing, which can have results of acute traumatic lesions of the spine. These lesions have a distinct implication because of the common involvement of the cervical spine, that can cause a neurological deficit which targets all four members. Compressive type of stress injury is most commonly encountered in sports where the following elements are found: high body weight and important muscle contraction, such as football and weight lifting.The stress caused by the torsion appears in the throwing action, for example the javelin throwers, baseball players and golfers.","The paper discusses the prevalence and implications of spine injuries in contact sports, particularly highlighting acute traumatic lesions and soft tissue injuries that can lead to neurological deficits. It emphasizes the role of high body weight and muscle contraction in exacerbating these injuries, with a focus on sports like football, wrestling, and boxing."
An Investigation into Kicking in Women’s Australian Football,2020-01-01,,,,"In Australian Rules football (AF), kick skill performance involvements, notably the drop
punt, are statistically strong contributors towards team match success. The start of a National
women’s AF competition (AFLW) in 2017 created opportunity for new knowledge to be
established around the characteristics of AFLW athletes’ skilled performances. Using
developments in inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology and analytical methods, this
thesis takes a multi-disciplinary approach to analysing AFLW skilled performances and
subsequently proposes a concept of a semi-automated AF kick type classification system for
skill monitoring in an applied environment. Specifically, the thesis: 1) evaluates the research
literature on machine learning for sport-specific movement recognition, 2) determines the
importance of AFLW athlete skilled performance indicator contributions during match play,
3) defines AFLW drop punt kick kinematics, and 4) evaluates AF kick type classification
models using IMUs as a proof-of-concept to support further developments in the area.
Understanding analytical methods previously implemented with IMU or computer vision
data and the evaluated capacity of these models in sport-specific movement recognition
literature, is important in the adaptation for, and application towards new problems in sport.
The first part of this thesis focuses on the experimental set-up, data pre-processing, and
model development methods in the relevant literature on recognition of sport-specific
movements in-field using IMU or computer vision technology. Of the 52 studies identified,
29 used IMUs, 22 used vision data and one study integrated both technologies. Supervised
machine learning models were the dominant approach for developing sport specific
movements recognition systems. Although nine studies implemented deep learning algorithms which comparatively indicated superior results to machine learning models, and
demonstrated the advantages and potential of these model types. This study also highlights
the importance of considering the model and overall system development in relation to the
targeted sports movement(s) when progressing future research in the field.
The applications of IMUs for sport skill recognition and subsequently performance analysis
in-situation demonstrated in the literature may be beneficial in AF. As AF matches are
technically skilled in nature, this thesis sought to investigate relationships of AFLW athlete
skill performances in explaining team quarter and match success which knowledge was
previously limited. Performance indicator distributions in explaining match quarter
outcomes show the strongest skilled contributions from key high performing athletes, and
the overall team strongest features related to kick performance indicators. Considering the
importance of the kick in AF, the thesis then continued to define the kinematics of AFLW
athlete’s drop punt kicks across leg preferences which was unknown. Several key
differences from men’s AF kicks were found, also, women’s kick movement patterns
quantified which is beneficial for specific coaching practices. Developments in IMU use for
sport-specific movement recognition through machine learning models demonstrate
advantages in sporting performance analysis applications. In the final section, these
technological developments are investigated for the concept of a semi-automated AF kick
monitoring system using IMUs. The work is applied in an AFLW training environment as a
unique study for capturing the importance kick skill performance towards team match
success and differentiation from men’s AF kick biomechanics. The findings indicate that
kick types can be sufficiently distinguished from one another which creates scope for further
applied work in AF training sessions. Overall, the work in this thesis is the first to establish
the biomechanical characteristics of elite women’s AF kicks and enhances the knowledge
of skilled performances in the AFLW. Furthermore, it is the first to implement IMUs for on-field AF kick recognition. Increasing automation in sport-specific movement recognition
can be applied in AF kick skill monitoring; particularly as a unique forefront in AFLW sport
science applications towards kick performance improvement. The methods used and
findings of this thesis can also be transferred to other elite women’s team sporting leagues
involving kicking actions such as Rugby and Gaelic football.","The paper explores the skilled performance of female athletes in Australian Rules football (AFLW) with a focus on kick skills, specifically the drop punt, and their contribution to team success. It employs inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology and machine learning to define kick kinematics, develop a semi-automated kick classification system, and differentiate performance patterns between genders, thereby enhancing the understanding of skilled performances in women's football and offering insights for coaching practices."

External Focus or Differential Learning: Is There an Additive Effect on Learning a Futsal Goal Kick?,2021-12-29,,,,"(1) Background: How to optimally promote the process of acquiring and learning a new motor skill is still one of the fundamental questions often raised in training and movement science, rehabilitation, and physical education. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of differential learning (DL) and the elements of OPTIMAL theory on learning a goal-kicking skill in futsal, especially under the conditions of external and internal foci. (2) Methods: A total of 40 female beginners were randomly assigned to, and equally distributed among, five different interventions. Within a pretest and post-test design, with retention and transfer tests, participants practiced for 12 weeks, involving two 20-min sessions per week. The tests involved a kicking skill test. Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. (3) Results: Statistically significant differences with large effect sizes were found between differential learning (DL) with an external focus, DL with an internal focus, DL with no focus, traditional training with an external focus, and traditional training with control groups in the post-, retention, and transfer tests. (4) Conclusions: The results indicate the clear advantages of DL. It is well worth putting further efforts into investigating a more differentiated application of instructions combined with exercises for DL.","This study investigates the impact of differential learning and external versus internal focus on acquiring a futsal goal-kicking skill among female beginners. The findings reveal that differential learning combined with an external focus significantly enhances skill acquisition compared to traditional training methods, indicating its potential effectiveness in motor skill training."
Efficacy of Prophylactic Knee Bracing in Sports,2021-12-24,,,,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries are common knee injuries, which can result from contact and noncontact during sports, recreation, or work-related activities. Prophylactic knee braces (PKBs) have been designed to protect the knee and decrease risk of recurrence of these injuries. Despite their success, PKBs have not been proven to be consistently effective and cost of the device must be evaluated to optimize its use in sports, particularly American football. Biomechanical studies have suggested that increased hip and knee flexion angles may reduce frontal plane loading with bracing which can protect the knee joint. This is essential with knee loading and rotational moments because they are associated with jumping, landing, and pivoting movements. The clinical efficacy of wearing PKBs can have an impact on athletic performance with respect to speed, power, motion, and agility, and these limitations are evident in athletes who are unaccustomed to wearing a PKB. Despite these concerns, use of PKBs increases in patients who have sustained an MCL injury or recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery. As the evidence continues to evolve in sports medicine, there is limited definitive data to determine their beneficial or detrimental effects on overall injury risk of athletes, therefore leading those recommendations and decisions for their usage in the hands of the athletic trainers and team physicians' experience to determine the specific brace design, brand, fit, and situations for use.","This paper examines the efficacy of prophylactic knee braces (PKBs) in preventing ACL and MCL injuries in sports, particularly in American football. It discusses the conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of PKBs, their potential impact on athletic performance, and the necessity for careful consideration by athletic trainers and team physicians regarding their use based on individual circumstances."
Different change of direction tests assess different physical ability parameters: Principal component analysis of nine change of direction tests,2021-12-24,,,,"Change of direction (CoD) ability is critical for the success of athletes in many sports. The purpose of this study was to perform a principal component analysis using 9 CoD tests in order to reveal possible subcomponents of CoD ability, which could aid practitioners in test selection. Male and female kinesiology students (n = 76) performed all CoD tests and a 30-m sprint test in a quasi-randomized, counterbalanced order. Three components for males and two components for females were extracted from principle component analysis (variance explained = 82.3 and 71.4%, respectively). It seems that the CoD test should be subdivided into at least two components: a) “pure CoD tests” (such as 505 test, T-test and 180° turn) and maneuverability tests (such as AFL run, Illinois test and Figure of Eight test). Considering that different factors seem to underlie CoD and maneuverability, our findings have important practical implications for training design. If hopping/jumping CoD is important for a given athlete, it should also be tested separately.","This paper investigates the assessment of change of direction (CoD) ability through principal component analysis of nine CoD tests to identify underlying factors affecting athletic performance. The study reveals distinct subcomponents of CoD, emphasizing the need for practitioners to tailor test selection based on the specific physical abilities relevant to athletes."
Effect of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture on Knee Proprioception Within 2 Years After Conservative and Operative Treatment: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,2021-12-02,,,,"Abstract Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays a major role in knee proprioception and is thus responsible for maintaining knee joint stability and functionality. The available evidence suggests that ACL reconstruction diminishes somatosensory feedback and proprioceptive functioning, which are vital for adequate joint positioning and movement control. Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of an ACL rupture on knee proprioception after arthroscopic ACL repair surgery or conservative treatment. Methods A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Guidelines for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature search was performed in the following databases from inception to 10th October 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and Scopus. Randomized and non-randomized studies that evaluated proprioception using the joint position sense (JPS) and threshold to detection of passive motion (TTDPM) techniques at 15°–30° knee flexion with an external healthy control group in a time period between 6 and 24 months post injury or operation were included in the analysis. Results In total, 4857 studies were identified, from which 11 were included in the final quantitative analysis. The results demonstrated that proprioception after arthroscopic ACL repair surgery was significantly lower than in the healthy control group (JPS: standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.87, p &lt; 0.01, n = 6 studies; TTDPM: SMD 0.77, 95% CI 0.20–1.34, p &lt; 0.01, n = 4 studies). There were no significant differences in proprioception between the conservative treatment group and the healthy control group (JPS: SMD 0.57, 95% CI − 0.69 to 1.84, p = 0.37, n = 4 studies; TTDPM: SMD 0.82, 95% CI − 0.02 to 1.65, p = 0.05, n = 2 studies), although measures for TTDPM were close to statistical significance. Conclusion The findings of the present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that knee proprioception is persistently compromised 6–24 months following surgical treatment of ACL tears compared with healthy controls. The reduced kinesthetic awareness after ACL surgery is of high relevance for optimizing individual treatment plans in these patients. As the current literature is still scarce about the exact underlying mechanisms, further research is needed. Trial Registration The present systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021198617).","This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the impact of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture on knee proprioception after both surgical and conservative treatments. The study finds that proprioception is significantly lower in patients post-ACL repair surgery compared to healthy controls, highlighting the importance of understanding these changes for optimizing treatment strategies."

"Kinesiophobia Relates to Decreased Sports Capability Perceptions, and Altered Gait Following ACL Reconstruction",2021-11-01,,,,"Introduction.Kinesiophobia can negatively influence perceived knee function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).Less is known about its influence on perceived sports capability, and gait kinematics.Methods.At 3 months after ACLR, 34 male patients completed the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK).Raw and grouped scores (group 1 = high kinesiophobia; group 2 = low kinesiophobia) were compared with perceived sports capability and gait kinematics over the initial 9 months after ACLR.The Tegner Activity Level Scale (TALS) was completed pre-injury, before ACLR, and at 6 and 9 months after ACLR.The Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale was completed pre-surgery, and at 6 and 9 months after ACLR.Walking and running gait analysis was performed at 3 and 6 months; and 6 months after ACLR, respectively (P ≤ 0.05).Results.Group TALS scores were similar pre-injury, however, Group 1 had lower TALS scores pre-surgery, and at 6 and 9 months after ACLR.Inverse relationships were observed for the 3 month TSK score and TALS scores before ACLR, and at 6 and 9 months afterwards.By 9 months following ACLR, kinesiophobia remained related to sports capability.Kinesiophobia had a stronger influence on side-to-side gait asymmetries than surgical side for hip adduction and mid-stance knee flexion when walking at 3 months after ACLR, for mid-stance knee flexion and terminal stance knee extension when walking at 6 months after ACLR, and for terminal stance knee extension when running at 6 months after ACLR.Conclusions.High kinesiophobia following ACLR was related to walking and running gait kinematic characteristics and sports capability perceptions.",This paper investigates the impact of kinesiophobia on perceived sports capability and gait kinematics in male patients post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The results indicate that higher levels of kinesiophobia are associated with lower sports capability scores and greater side-to-side gait asymmetries during walking and running in the months following surgery.
198 Challenging ACL reconstructed athletes and their sensorimotor system at return-to-sport: a vital step towards exposing the roots of their neuromuscular deficits,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Evidence increasingly suggests that neuromuscular alterations in ACL reconstructed (ACLR) patients are rooted in neurocognitive and proprioceptive deficits. <h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to reveal how neurocognitive and proprioceptive deficits determine neuromuscular control alterations seen in ACLR athletes. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Athletes who return to a cutting or pivoting sport after an ACL reconstruction. <h3>Patients</h3> 20 athletes who had an ACL reconstruction and were cleared by the surgeon/physiotherapist to return to sport (RTS), were tested at time of RTS. A control group of 20 uninjured athletes, matched for gender and type of sport, was included. <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> All participants performed a stepping-down task under 4 conditions: 1. no additional challenges (NORM), 2. whilst performing a cognitive dual-task (DUAL), 3. whilst undergoing unpredictable surface perturbations (PERT), 4. whilst performing a cognitive dual-task + undergoing unpredictable surface perturbations. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Muscle activations of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis, hamstrings medialis (HM), hamstrings lateralis were recorded with surface EMG. Integrals were calculated over the landing period (50–250 ms after initial contact) and normalized to maximal voluntary contractions. <h3>Results</h3> The ACLR athletes showed an almost unadjusted strategy of increased HM (6.7% (ACL); 3.9% (control), F=5.07, p=0.031) and decreased VM activation across all tasks (6.8% (ACL); 12.9% (control), F=8.52, p=0.006 ), whilst the control group had a clear increase in HM activation (3.2% (NORM); 5.6% (PERT), t=4.06, p=0.001) and VM activation (9.0% (NORM);16.9% (PERT), t=3.81, p=0.001) when unpredictable perturbations occurred. However, within the ACLR athletes HM activation decreased when a dual task was added (7.3% (NORM); 4.7% (DUAL), t=3.4, p=0.003). <h3>Conclusions</h3> It seems that the neuromuscular strategy of the ACLR athlete is an overprotective strategy to improve knee stability. They use this strategy in every situation, potentially to compensate for the altered proprioceptive input. This overprotective strategy is jeopardized under cognitively challenging circumstances, confirming that underlying neurocognitive limitations contribute to altered neuromuscular control in ACLR athletes.","The paper investigates the impact of neurocognitive and proprioceptive deficits on neuromuscular control in athletes who have undergone ACL reconstruction. It reveals that ACLR athletes adopt an overprotective neuromuscular strategy to enhance knee stability, which is compromised under cognitive challenges, indicating that these deficits play a significant role in their post-reconstruction performance."
149 Running style-dependent risk factors for patellofemoral pain,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Patellofemoral-pain is a widespread problem among recreational-runners. Often it comes to training absenteeism because of pain at the proximal edge of the patella. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine if there is a connection between the occurrence of patellofemoral pain and the running style. <h3>Design</h3> Retrospective case-control-study. <h3>Setting</h3> The running analyses all took place in the same 2 D running lab. The selected analyses are of recreational and amateur runners, running at least 10km/week, who were complaining of patellofemoral pain. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> There was a pool of 1013 running-analyses in which the subjects complained of patellofemoral complaints (234 analyses), then all dates of recreational and competitive athletes (234 analyses) were first filtered out. This resulted in an analysis number of 113 analyses, which were included. All participants were examined by a sport medicine specialist and the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome were determined by X-ray and MRI imaging. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Primary contact with the ground, malposition of the legs, Achilles tendon angle, pelvic stability, knee inflection and lower leg swing were observed via a 2D running-analyse. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> The 113 analyses were examined in terms of running technique and dynamic biomechanical misalignments. The evaluation was based on the 4-point model of Marquardt. <h3>Results</h3> It was noteworthy that in 98.2% (n = 111) of the examined subjects, the primary contact with the ground was via the heel. In 90.9% (n = 101) of these subjects, there was also increased knee flexion in the medium support phase. This was also observed in the other two subjects without heel strike (91.1% (n = 103) increased knee flexion). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The primary contact of the heel and also an increased knee flexion in the medium support phase can increased the risk of patellofemoral-pain occurrence.",This paper investigates the relationship between running style and patellofemoral pain among recreational runners. It finds that heel strike and increased knee flexion during the medium support phase may contribute to a higher risk of developing patellofemoral pain.
237 Contact injuries predominate in female youth team sports: an opportunity for prevention,2021-11-01,,,,"<h3>Background</h3> Sport participation is the leading cause of injury in youth. Female youth are underrepresented in the sport injury literature and present with a different injury profile than males. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate sport-related injury rates, types, locations and mechanisms in female youth team sports. <h3>Design</h3> Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> High schools in Alberta, Canada. <h3>Participants</h3> Female students who reported playing one of the top ten team sports for participation (i.e., baseball, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, volleyball, football, rugby, ringette, field hockey, ice hockey). Assessment of Risk Factors A 45-minute survey included questions regarding demographic information, sport participation, and one-year injury and concussion history. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Self-reported injuries sustained in the past year. <h3>Results</h3> 51.7% (1048/2029) of high school students completing the survey were female and 481/1048 (45.9%) reported playing at least one team sport. Of these, 51.4% reported at least one sport-related injury and 8.9% at least one concussion in the past year. Injury rate based on 'most serious injury' reported was highest in ringette (42.9 injuries/100 students/year) and rugby (40.0). The top three most serious injury locations were the knee (24.7%), ankle (21.6%) and head (16.1%). The most common injury types were joint or ligament sprain (26.7%), fracture (13.0%) and concussion (11.8%). Based on all serious injuries reported in female team sports, 73.4% occurred via contact mechanisms (with someone or something). Overuse (16.2%) was the next most common mechanism reported. Of participants that reported concussion as their most serious injury, 100% were attributed to contact mechanisms (38.9% contact with someone; 61.1% contact with something). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Team sport injury rates are high in female high school students. Specific consideration of contact injury mechanisms in female youth team sports will inform development and evaluation of targeted female contact and sport-specific prevention strategies.","This paper investigates the rates, types, locations, and mechanisms of sport-related injuries among female youth in team sports, highlighting a high prevalence of contact injuries. The findings reveal that a significant portion of these injuries, including concussions, are caused by contact mechanisms, emphasizing the need for targeted prevention strategies in this demographic."
"Fatigue does not increase limb asymmetry or induce proximal joint power shift during sprinting in habitual, multi-speed runners",2021-10-18,,,,"ABSTRACT The ability to shift from walking and jogging to sprinting gaits, even when fatigued after prolonged effort, would have been as useful to our hunter-gatherer ancestors as it is to modern athletes. During prolonged jogging, joint moment and work decrease in the distal (ankle) joint but increase at proximal (hip/knee) joints as fatigue progresses, and such adaptations might be expected to occur in sprinting. Fatigue is also thought to increase inter-limb kinematic and force production asymmetries, which are speculated to influence injury risk. However, the effects of running-related fatigue on sprint running gait have been incompletely studied, so these hypotheses remain untested. We studied 3-D kinematics and ground reaction force production in dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NDL) legs during both non-fatigued and fatigued sprinting in habitual but uncoached running athletes. Contrary to the tested hypotheses, relative between-leg differences were greater in non-fatigued than fatigued sprinting. When not fatigued, DL produced greater propulsive impulse through both greater positive and negative work being done at the ankle, whilst NDL produced more vertical impulse, possibly resulting from the greater hip flexion observed prior to the downwards acceleration of the foot towards the ground. Whilst few changes were detected in DL once fatigued, NDL shifted towards greater horizontal force production, largely resulting from an increase in plantarflexion (distal-joint) moments and power. After fatiguing running, therefore, inter-limb asymmetry was reduced during sprinting and no distal-to-proximal shift in work/power was detected. Speculatively, these adaptations may help to attenuate decreases in running speed whilst minimising injury risk. Significance The ability to attain fast running speeds may critically determine success in tasks such as prey chase- and-capture in hunter-gatherer societies as well as success in modern sports competitions. At times, sprint running may have to be performed whilst fatigued from previous, longer-distance running, when speeds are reduced, and injury risk may be higher. Previous work indicated that fatigue prompts a proximal shift in joint work and power production and an increase in inter-limb asymmetry. On the contrary, we show that relative ankle positive and negative joint work was maintained in the face of fatigue and that inter-limb asymmetry was reduced in a group of runners experienced, but not formally instructed, in both long-distance and sprint running.","The paper investigates the impact of fatigue on sprinting mechanics in habitual runners, specifically examining limb asymmetry and joint power distribution. The findings reveal that fatigue does not increase limb asymmetry during sprinting; instead, inter-limb asymmetry is reduced, and relative joint work at the ankle is maintained despite fatigue, which may help minimize injury risk and maintain running speed."
Computational modelling in sport: a hybrid simulation of the runner as a complex adaptive system,2021-10-16,,,,"Running-related injuries, specifically overuse injuries, are complex and multifaceted. A different way of thinking is required to fully comprehend why, and how, these injuries occur. The systems thinking perspective offers tools and techniques to capture system-wide interactions in causal, closed-loop structures which may be studied and quantified in a practical way. The value of systems thinking in sport may only realise when pragmatic models follow descriptive, qualitative models. This article instantiates a qualitative, systems thinking perspective of the runner as a complex adaptive system with a hybrid simulation model. The approach is substantiated with principles from physics and physiology and is partially driven by data from a running watch. Results demonstrate that the scientific, reductionist method may be augmented with dynamic, closed-loop thinking and simulation modelling.","This paper explores the application of systems thinking in understanding running-related overuse injuries by presenting a hybrid simulation model of the runner as a complex adaptive system.

Analysis of the associations between variables derived throughout velocity-based training device and jumping performances in youth soccer players: Multiple regression study,2021-10-04,,,,"deadlift; Banyard et al., 2019).Specifically, using linear position transducers and accelerometers, the load velocity is calculated, and an individual load-velocity profile is created.As a result, the coach can precisely prescribe and adjust the load based on the velocity during the training (van den Tillaar & Ball, 2019).However, it must be highlighted that athletes have to perform the exercise with the maximal intended movement velocity.Otherwise, the velocity of the barbell will not be reliable, and the prescribed load would be underestimated (Mann et al., 2015).Finally, VBT provides immediate feedback about the execution of the exercise/movement, which allows objective modifications of the load, identifies optimal loads and velocities for training to improve the specificity of training, and reduces fatigue after exercise (Banyard et al., 2019;Hughes et al., 2019;Mann et al., 2015).Thus, VBT is used in different exercises/movements depending on the sport requirements and is used for enhancing specific sports performances (Mann et al., 2015).Studies have investigated the effects of VBT on performance in certain sports.Dorrell et al. (2020) noted that six weeks of a VBT intervention led to increases in maximal strength in the back squat, bench press, overhead","This paper examines the relationships between variables obtained from velocity-based training (VBT) devices and the jumping performances of youth soccer players, utilizing multiple regression analysis.

Kinetic measurement system use in individuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a scoping review of methodological approaches,2021-09-26,,,,"Abstract Purpose Our primary objectives were to (1) describe current approaches for kinetic measurements in individuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and (2) suggest considerations for methodological reporting. Secondarily, we explored the relationship between kinetic measurement system findings and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods We followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews and Arksey and O’Malley’s 6-stage framework. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to June 2020. Original research papers reporting parameters measured by kinetic measurement systems in individuals at least 6-months post primary ACLR were included. Results In 158 included studies, 7 kinetic measurement systems (force plates, balance platforms, pressure mats, force-measuring treadmills, Wii balance boards, contact mats connected to jump systems, and single-sensor insoles) were identified 4 main movement categories (landing/jumping, standing balance, gait, and other functional tasks). Substantial heterogeneity was noted in the methods used and outcomes assessed; this review highlighted common methodological reporting gaps for essential items related to movement tasks, kinetic system features, justification and operationalization of selected outcome parameters, participant preparation, and testing protocol details. Accordingly, we suggest considerations for methodological reporting in future research. Only 6 studies included PROMs with inconsistency in the reported parameters and/or PROMs. Conclusion Clear and accurate reporting is vital to facilitate cross-study comparisons and improve the clinical application of kinetic measurement systems after ACLR. Based on the current evidence, we suggest methodological considerations to guide reporting in future research. Future studies are needed to examine potential correlations between kinetic parameters and PROMs.","This paper reviews methodological approaches for kinetic measurements in individuals post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), identifying various measurement systems and their application in different movement categories.

Comprehensive Rehabilitation After Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament,2021-08-18,,,,"Introduction: The knee joint is the second most frequently injured joint. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a relatively common injury to the inner part of the knee joint, mainly related to contact sports. Its rupture leads to instability of the entire joint. Two treatment options are possible: operative or conservative. Each of them is related to an appropriate rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to define a comprehensive rehabilitation plan in patients after ACL rupture and meniscal suturing.Materials and methods: The work was written based on the medical history of the patient who was diagnosed with complete rupture of ACL, and then reconstruction was performed with the harvesting of a semitendinous and slender muscle graft.Results: The rehabilitation process can be divided into two stages: hospital and post-hospital. Rehabilitation in hospital conditions begins on the zero day after arthroscopy. The main goals of rehabilitation include: increasing the range of mobility, no myofascial dysfunctions, no thromboembolic complications, and the ability to self-service.Conclusion: Rehabilitation is an indispensable element of the treatment of patients after ACL reconstruction. Early initiation of rehabilitation brings tangible benefits during treatment and return to full physical fitness.","This paper discusses the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan for patients recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and meniscal suturing, emphasizing the importance of early rehabilitation.

An epidemiologic comparison of acute and overuse injuries in high school sports,2021-08-11,,,,"Abstract Background Acute and overuse injuries affect millions of high school athletes annually and a better understanding of differences between these injuries is needed to help guide prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies. This study compares acute and overuse injuries using a nationally representative sample of high school athletes. Methods Injuries among United States high school athletes participating in 5 boys’ sports (football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball) and 4 girls’ sports (soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball) reported in the High School RIO™ surveillance system during the 2006-07 through 2018-19 school years were classified as acute or overuse. National estimates and injury rates were calculated. Results Of 17 434 646 estimated injuries, 92.0 % were acute and 8.0 % were overuse. The acute injury rate was higher than the overuse injury rate among both male (Rate Ratio [RR] 16.38, 95 % CI: 15.70–17.10) and female (RR 8.14, 95 % CI: 7.71–8.60) athletes. The overuse injury rate per 10,000 athlete exposures among female athletes (1.8) was slightly higher than among males (1.4). The rate of acute injury compared with the rate of overuse injury was higher during competition (RR 32.00, 95 % CI: 29.93–34.22) than practice (RR 7.19, 95 % CI: 6.91–7.47). Boys’ football contributed the most acute (42.1 %) and overuse (23.7 %) injuries among the 9 sports. Among female sports, girls’ soccer contributed the most acute (15.6 % of all acute injuries) and overuse (19.4 % of all overuse injuries) injuries. The lower extremity was most commonly injured in acute (48.9 %) and overuse (65.9 %) injuries. Ligament sprain (31.7 %) and concussion (21.0 %) were the most common acute injury diagnoses, while muscle strain (23.3 %) and tendonitis (23.2 %) were the most common overuse injury diagnoses. Compared with acute injuries, overuse injuries were more likely to result in time loss from sports participation of &lt; 1 week among both boys and girls and across most sports. Acute injuries were more likely than overuse injuries to cause a time loss of 1–3 weeks or medical disqualification from sports participation. Conclusions Acute and overuse injuries display many differences that provide opportunities for data-informed athlete preparation, treatment, and rehabilitation, which may reduce injuries and improve injury outcomes in high school athletics.","This paper investigates the prevalence and differences between acute and overuse injuries in high school sports using a large national sample. It finds that acute injuries are significantly more common than overuse injuries, particularly during competition in boys' football and girls' soccer, highlighting the need for targeted prevention and rehabilitation strategies based on these injury patterns."

However, ACL injury risk research often leans towards methods with three limitations: 1) a poor preservation of the athlete-environment relationship that limits the generalisability of results, 2) the use of a strictly biomechanical approach to injury causation that is incomplete for the description of injury mechanisms, 3) and a reductionist analysis that neglects profound information regarding human movement. This current opinion proposes three principles from an ecological dynamics perspective that address these limitations. First, it is argued that, to improve the generalisability of findings, research requires a well-preserved athlete-environment relationship. Second, the merit of including behaviour and the playing situation in the model of injury causation is presented. Third, this paper advocates that research benefits from conducting non-reductionist analysis (i.e., more holistic) that provides profound information regarding human movement. Together, these principles facilitate an ecological dynamics approach to injury risk research that helps to expand our understanding of injury mechanisms and thus contributes to the development of preventative measures.","This paper discusses the limitations of current ACL injury risk research and proposes an ecological dynamics approach to enhance understanding of injury mechanisms. It emphasizes the importance of preserving the athlete-environment relationship, incorporating behavioral factors, and adopting holistic analyses to improve injury prevention strategies."
Management of thoracic spinal cord injury in a professional American football athlete: illustrative case,2021-08-09,,,,"A case of catastrophic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) sustained by a professional American football player with severe scoliosis is presented.A 25-year-old professional football player sustained an axial loading injury while tackling. Examination revealed a T8 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A complete SCI. Methylprednisolone and hypothermia protocols were initiated. Computed tomography scan of the thoracic spine demonstrated T8 and T9 facet fractures on the left at the apex of a 42° idiopathic scoliotic deformity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated T2 spinal cord hyperintensity at T9. He regained trace movement of his right lower extremity over 12 hours, which was absent on posttrauma day 2. Repeat MRI revealed interval cord compression and worsening of T2 signal change at T7-T8 secondary to hematoma. Urgent decompression and fusion from T8 to T10 were performed. Additional treatment included high-dose omega-3 fatty acids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. A 2-month inpatient spinal cord rehabilitation program was followed by prolonged outpatient physical therapy. He currently can run and jump with minimal residual distal left lower limb spasticity.This is the first known football-related thoracic SCI with idiopathic scoliosis. Aggressive medical and surgical intervention with intensive rehabilitation formed the treatment protocol, with a favorable outcome achieved.","The paper presents a case study of a professional American football player who sustained a catastrophic thoracic spinal cord injury due to an axial loading incident while tackling, compounded by severe scoliosis. It details the treatment protocol that involved surgical intervention, aggressive medical management, and a comprehensive rehabilitation program, ultimately leading to a favorable recovery outcome."
Effects of Open Skill Visuomotor Choice Reaction Time Training on Unanticipated Jump-Landing Stability and Quality: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-07-29,,,,"Adapting movements rapidly to unanticipated external stimuli is paramount for athletic performance and to prevent injuries. We investigated the effects of a 4-week open-skill choice-reaction training intervention on unanticipated jump-landings. Physically active adults ( n = 37; mean age 27, standard deviation 2.7 years, 16 females, 21 males) were randomly allocated to one of two interventions or a control group (CG). Participants in the two intervention groups performed a 4-week visuomotor open skill choice reaction training, one for the upper and one for the lower extremities. Before and after the intervention, two different types of countermovement jumps with landings in split stance position were performed. In the (1) pre-planned condition, we informed the participants regarding the landing position (left or right foot in front position) before the jump. In the (2) unanticipated condition, this information was displayed after take-off (350–600 ms reaction time before landing). Outcomes were landing stability [peak vertical ground reaction force (pGRF) and time to stabilization (TTS)], and landing-related decision-making quality (measured by the number of landing errors). To measure extremity-specific effects, we documented the number of correct hits during the trained drills. A two-factorial (four repeated measures: two conditions, two time factors; three groups) ANCOVA was carried out; conditions = unanticipated versus pre-planned condition, time factors = pre versus post measurement, grouping variable = intervention allocation, co-variates = jumping time and self-report arousal. The training improved performance over the intervention period (upper extremity group: mean of correct choice reaction hits during 5 s drill: +3.0 hits, 95% confidence interval: 2.2–3.9 hits; lower extremity group: +1.6 hits, 0.6–2.6 hits). For pGRF ( F = 8.4, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and landing errors ( F = 17.1, p &amp;lt; 0.001) repeated measures effect occurred. Significantly more landing errors occurred within the unanticipated condition for all groups and measurement days. The effect in pGRF is mostly impacted by between-condition differences in the CG. No between-group or interaction effect was seen for these outcomes: pGRF ( F = 0.4, p = 0.9; F = 2.3, p = 0.1) landing errors ( F = 0.5, p = 0.6; F = 2.3, p = 0.1). TTS displayed a repeated measures ( F = 4.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001, worse values under the unanticipated condition, improvement over time) and an interaction effect ( F = 2.4, p = 0.03). Healthy adults can improve their choice reaction task performance by training. As almost no transfer to unanticipated landing successfulness or movement quality occurred, the effect seems to be task-specific. Lower-extremity reactions to unanticipated stimuli may be improved by more specific training regimens.","This study examines the impact of a 4-week open-skill choice-reaction training intervention on jump-landing stability and decision-making in physically active adults. Results indicate that while the training improved choice reaction performance and time to stabilization, it did not significantly transfer to unanticipated landing success or overall movement quality, suggesting that these effects are largely task-specific."
Aging Affects Lower Limb Joint Moments and Muscle Responses to a Split-Belt Treadmill Perturbation,2021-07-19,,,,"Age-related changes cause more fall-related injuries and impede the recoveries by older adults compared to younger adults. This study assessed the lower limb joint moments and muscle responses to split-belt treadmill perturbations in two groups (14 healthy young group [23.36 ± 2.90 years] and 14 healthy older group [70.93 ± 4.36 years]) who performed two trials of unexpected split-belt treadmill perturbations while walking on a programmable split-belt treadmill. A motion capture system quantified the lower limb joint moments, and a wireless electromyography system recorded the lower limb muscle responses. The compensatory limb's (i.e., the tripped limb's contralateral side) joint moments and muscle responses were computed during the pre-perturbation period (the five gait cycles before the onset of a split-belt treadmill perturbation) and the recovery period (from the split-belt treadmill perturbation to the baseline gait relying on the ground reaction forces' profile). Joint moments were assessed by maximum joint moments, and muscle responses were quantified by the normalization (%) and co-contraction index (CCI). Joint moments and muscle responses of the compensatory limb during the recovery period were significantly higher for the YG than the OG, and joint moments (e.g., knee flexion and extension and hip flexion moments) and muscle responses during the recovery period were higher compared to the pre-perturbation period for both groups. For CCI, the older group showed significantly higher co-contraction for biceps femoris/rectus femoris muscles than the young group during the recovery period. For both groups, co-contraction for biceps femoris/rectus femoris muscles was higher during the pre-perturbation period than the recovery period. The study confirmed that older adults compensated for muscle weakness by using lower joint moments and muscle activations and increasing muscle co-contractions to recover balance after split-belt treadmill perturbations. A better understanding of the recovery mechanisms of older adults who train on fall-inducing systems could improve therapeutic regimens.","This study investigates the impact of aging on lower limb joint moments and muscle responses during perturbations on a split-belt treadmill, comparing healthy young and older adults. Key findings indicate that older adults exhibit greater co-contraction of specific muscles and increased joint moments during recovery from perturbations, suggesting adaptations to compensate for muscle weakness and improve balance recovery mechanisms."
Maturity alters drop vertical jump landing force‐time profiles but not performance outcomes in adolescent females,2021-07-18,,,,"The stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) assists in effective force attenuation upon landing and augments force generation at take-off during a drop vertical jump (DVJ). General performance outcomes such as jump height or peak measures have been used to assess SSC function in youth populations; however, these discrete metrics fail to provide insight into temporal jump-landing characteristics. This study assessed DVJ force-time profiles in 1013 middle and high-school female athletes (n = 279 prepubertal, n = 401 pubertal, and n = 333 postpubertal). Maturity status was determined using the Pubertal Maturation Observation Scale. Ground reaction force data were analyzed to extract a range of variables to characterize force-time profiles. SSC function was categorized as poor, moderate, or good dependent on the presence of an impact peak and spring-like behavior. No differences in jump height or ground contact time were observed between maturity groups (p > 0.05). Significant differences in absolute peak landing and take-off force were evident between all maturational statuses (p < 0.05). Relative to bodyweight normalized forces, only peak take-off force was significantly different between prepubertal and postpubertal groups (p < 0.05; d = 0.22). Spring-like behavior showed small improvements from pubertal to postpubertal (p < 0.05; d = 0.25). Most females displayed poor SSC function at prepubertal (79.6%), pubertal (77.3%), and postpubertal (65.5%) stages of maturity. Large increases in absolute forces occur throughout maturation in female athletes; however, only small maturational differences were found in relative force or spring-like behavior. Consequently, most girls display poor SSC function irrespective of maturity.","This paper investigates the impact of maturity on drop vertical jump (DVJ) landing force-time profiles in adolescent females, analyzing data from 1,013 athletes across different maturity stages. The findings indicate no significant differences in jump height or ground contact time among maturity groups, but reveal substantial variations in peak landing and take-off forces, highlighting that most females demonstrate poor stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function throughout maturation stages."
Functional Cortical Connectivity Related to Postural Control in Patients Six Weeks After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2021-07-15,,,,"Whereas initial findings have already identified cortical patterns accompanying proprioceptive deficiencies in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), little is known about compensatory sensorimotor mechanisms for re-establishing postural control. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore leg dependent patterns of cortical contributions to postural control in patients 6 weeks following ACLR. A total of 12 patients after ACLR (25.1 ± 3.2 years, 178.1 ± 9.7 cm, 77.5 ± 14.4 kg) and another 12 gender, age, and activity matched healthy controls participated in this study. All subjects performed 10 × 30 s. single leg stances on each leg, equipped with 64-channel mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Postural stability was quantified by area of sway and sway velocity. Estimations of the weighted phase lag index were conducted as a cortical measure of functional connectivity. The findings showed significant group × leg interactions for increased functional connectivity in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injured leg, predominantly including fronto−parietal [ F (1, 22) = 8.41, p ≤ 0.008, η 2 = 0.28], fronto−occipital [ F (1, 22) = 4.43, p ≤ 0.047, η 2 = 0.17], parieto−motor [ F (1, 22) = 10.30, p ≤ 0.004, η 2 = 0.32], occipito−motor [ F (1, 22) = 5.21, p ≤ 0.032, η 2 = 0.19], and occipito−parietal [ F (1, 22) = 4.60, p ≤ 0.043, η 2 = 0.17] intra−hemispherical connections in the contralateral hemisphere and occipito−motor [ F (1, 22) = 7.33, p ≤ 0.013, η 2 = 0.25] on the ipsilateral hemisphere to the injured leg. Higher functional connectivity in patients after ACLR, attained by increased emphasis of functional connections incorporating the somatosensory and visual areas, may serve as a compensatory mechanism to control postural stability of the injured leg in the early phase of rehabilitation. These preliminary results may help to develop new neurophysiological assessments for detecting functional deficiencies after ACLR in the future.","This study investigates cortical connectivity related to postural control in patients six weeks post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Findings indicate increased functional connectivity in brain regions associated with proprioception and visual processing in the injured leg, suggesting these adaptations may assist in reestablishing postural stability during early rehabilitation."
Core bone diameter in an organic implant-less technique affecting the biomechanical properties of the anterior cruciate ligament fixation; an in-vitro study,2021-07-13,,,,"Abstract Background Bone and site hold tendon inside (BASHTI) is an implant-less technique that can solve some of the problems associated with other anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive methods. This study aims to investigate the effect of core bone diameter variation on the biomechanical properties of a reconstructed ACL using BASHTI technique. Methods A number of 15 laboratory samples of reconstructed ACL were built using bovine digital tendons and Sawbones blocks. Samples were divided into three groups with different core bone diameters of 8 mm, 8.5 mm, and 9 mm. The double-stranded tendon size and bone tunnel diameter were 8 mm and 10 mm, respectively. A loading scenario consisting of two cyclic loadings followed by a single cycle pull-out loading was applied to the samples simulating the after-surgery loading conditions to observe the fixation strength. Results Results showed that the core bone diameter had a significant effect on the failure mode of the samples ( P = 0.006) and their fixation strength ( P &lt; 0.001). Also, it was observed that the engaging length and the average cyclic stiffness (ACS) of them were influenced by the core bone diameter significantly (engaging length: P = 0.001, ACS: P = 0.007), but its effect on the average pull-out stiffness was not significant ( P = 0.053). Conclusions It was concluded that core bone diameter variation has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of ACL reconstruction when BASHTI technique is used, and it should be noted for surgeons who use BASHTI technique. Abstract Figure Highlights A new implant-less technique was used to reconstruct anterior cruciate ligament. Artificial bone and fresh animal soft tissue used to simulate the fixation process. Loading condition were carefully chosen to simulate the post-operation. Components geometry had direct effect on biomechanical properties of the fixation. Optimum geometry was found trough an experimental examination.","This paper investigates the impact of core bone diameter on the biomechanical properties of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) fixation using the implant-less BASHTI technique. The study found that variations in core bone diameter significantly affect failure mode and fixation strength, providing essential insights for surgeons employing this reconstruction method."
"Peer Review #2 of ""The effects of hip- and ankle-focused exercise intervention on dynamic knee valgus: a systematic review (v0.3)""",2021-07-05,,,,"The remaining three studies did not show significant improvement in DKV after the exercise intervention (range between eight weeks to twelve weeks) probably because they focused on trunk and back muscles instead of muscles crossing the knee joint. Conclusion.Exercises targeting specific knee-joint muscles, either from top-down or bottom-up kinetic chain, are likely to reduce DKV formation.These results may assist athletes and coaches to develop effective exercise program that could minimize DKV and ultimately prevent lower limb injuries.",The paper reviews the effects of hip- and ankle-focused exercise interventions on dynamic knee valgus (DKV) and concludes that exercises targeting specific knee-joint muscles are more effective at reducing DKV formation.

"NEURAL ACTIVITY AND LANDING BIOMECHANICS: EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE BRAIN, BODY, AND ACL INJURY-RISK",2021-07-01,,,,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries predominantly occur via non-contact mechanisms, secondary to motor coordination errors resulting in aberrant frontal plane knee loads that exceed the thresholds of ligament integrity. However, central nervous system processing underlying high injury-risk motor coordination errors remain unknown, limiting the optimization of current injury reduction strategies. Purpose: To evaluate the relationships between brain activity during motor tasks with injury-risk loading during a drop vertical jump. Methods: Thirty female high school soccer players (16.10 ± 0.87 years, 165.10 ± 4.64 cm, 63.43 ± 8.80 kg) were evaluated with 3D biomechanics during a standardized drop vertical jump from a 30 cm box and peak knee abduction moment was extracted as the injury-risk variable of interest. A neuroimaging session to capture neural activity (via blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal) was then completed which consisted of 4 blocks of 30 seconds of repeated bilateral leg press action paced to a metronome beat of 1.2 Hz with 30 seconds rest between blocks. Knee abduction moment was evaluated relative to neural activity to identify potential neural contributors to injury-risk. Results: There was a direct relationship between increased landing knee abduction moment and increased neural activation within regions corresponding to the lingual gyrus, intracalcarine cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus (r 2 = 0.68, p corrected &lt; .05, z max &gt; 3.1; Table 1 &amp; Figure 1). Conclusion: Elevated activity in regions that integrate sensory, spatial, and attentional information may contribute to elevated frontal plane knee loads during landing. Interestingly, a similar activation pattern related to high-risk landing mechanics has been found in those following injury, indicating that predisposing factors to injury may be accentuated by injury or that modern rehabilitation does not recover prospective neural control deficits. These data uncover a potentially novel brain marker that could guide the discovery of neural-therapeutic targets that reduce injury risk beyond current prevention methods. [Table: see text][Figure: see text]","This paper investigates the relationship between brain activity and landing mechanics, specifically how neural activation during motor tasks correlates with knee abduction moments linked to ACL injury risk, using female high school soccer players as subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural activation in specific brain regions may contribute to elevated knee loading during landings, highlighting the potential for neural markers to inform injury prevention strategies."

Gastrocnemius medialis muscle-tendon properties and their relationship with power and reactive strength in elite youth soccer players,2021-07-01,,,,"There are several key physical performance indicators (KPIs) in soccer, and these include lower limb power and reactive strength, which can be evaluated using a variety of jump assessments, e.g. countermovement jumps (CMJs) and drop jumps (DJs). These KPIs are thought to be underpinned by the physiological characteristics of the respective lower limb muscle-tendon units (MTUs). However, the influence of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) MTU on power and reactive strength in elite youth soccer players (ESP) is currently unknown. Before assessing MTU properties and KPIs in ESP, it is important to understand the reproducibility of the respective assessment methods. In chapter 3, the aim was to identify the between-session reliability of all methodological techniques involved in the subsequent chapters. For this, 12 physically active, healthy, young men were recruited, the findings demonstrated all morphological properties of the GM muscle and GM tendon could be measured with high levels of reproducibility (coefficient of variation (CV)=1.2-6.6%; mean bias ratio (MBR)=1.00-1.09, ratio limits of agreement (RLoA)=1.04-1.22). Mechanical and material properties of the GM tendon could also be measured reliably (CV=2.6-17.3%; MBR=1.00-1.13, RLoA=1.08-1.80), however, the reproducibility of these techniques was slightly lower than for the morphological properties. Furthermore, a simplified method for calculating GM tendon mechanical/material properties proved reliable and agreed with the more comprehensive method, when assessed in 13 ESP and 12 non-athletes. This provides researchers/practitioners with a valid, reliable, and efficient method to monitor GM MTU properties when time is limited, e.g. when working with elite athletes. During jump-based assessments, peak power was measured more reliably during bilateral than unilateral CMJ, while reactive strength temporal variables during a DJ were more reliable than kinetic parameters. The second experimental study (chapter 4) aimed to determine whether the physiological characteristics of the GM muscle, as well as lower-limb power and reactive strength (the ability to develop maximal forces in minimal time while changing from an eccentric to concentric contraction) during CMJ and DJ, differed between ESP and recreationally active control participants (CON). A second aim was to investigate the relationship between GM muscle properties with lower limb power and reactive strength. ESP (17.4 ± 2.5) displayed a larger GM fascicle pennation angle (θp) compared to CON (14.3 ± 1.2, P<0.001), while projectile range and horizontal peak power during bilateral and unilateral horizontal CMJ were greater in the ESP. Furthermore, GM θp and cross-sectional area correlated with power generated in the vertical and horizontal plane of motion during unilateral vertical and bilateral horizontal CMJ, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, GM muscle fascicle length and muscle volume both correlated inversely with power during bilateral vertical and horizontal jumps, although this may represent the differing biomechanical demands between unilateral and bilateral jumping tasks. The third experimental study (chapter 5) aimed to determine whether the mechanical and material properties of the GM tendon differed between ESP and CON, and whether GM tendon properties were related to lower limb power and reactive strength during CMJs and DJ. Tendon properties did not differ between ESP and CON but tendon elongation and strain correlated inversely with power during unilateral vertical CMJ, whilst higher force and vertical stiffness outputs were achieved during a DJ by stronger individuals with stiffer and larger GM tendons. Together with the findings from chapter 4, the results from chapter 5 suggest that specific physiological characteristics of the GM MTU could be deemed favourable for lower limb power and reactive strength capabilities. Through identifying (and perhaps developing) these characteristics in ESP, such KPIs in soccer players may be improved. The purpose of the fourth and final experimental study (chapter 6) was to investigate the effects of a 12-week in-season soccer training programme on GM MTU properties and jump performance in 14 ESP. Post-training, GM θp (pre-training: 18.0 ± 2.5 ; post-training: 17.2 ± 2.6 ; P=0.038), maximal tendon elongation (pre-training: 2.68 ± 0.58 cm; post-training: 2.30 ± 0.46 cm; P=0.019) and maximal tendon strain (pre-training: 12.8 ± 2.4 %; post-training: 11.1 ± 2.5 %; P=0.019) all reduced. Furthermore, projectile range during a unilateral horizontal CMJ increased from pre- to post-training (pre-training: 0.93 ± 0.15 m; post-training: 1.07 ± 0.12 m; P=0.001) but no other jump metrics changed. The physiological reasons for these changes are unclear but it is plausible that GM θp decreased to facilitate a faster shortening of the overall muscle in response to pitch-based training. Alternatively, it may have occurred in response to the limited progressive overload applied to the plantar flexors during in-season training (potentially leading to a detraining effect). Further, the reductions in tendon elongation and strain may have been due to a change in the material properties of the tendon (e.g. increased density of collagen fibrils) that did not quite translate to changes in stiffness or modulus. Crucially, however, these changes did not correlate (neither individually, nor in combination) with the change in projectile range during a unilateral horizontal CMJ, thus suggesting they did not contribute to this increase in jump performance. These results demonstrate that a 12-week period of in-season soccer training is not a sufficient chronic stimulus to elicit meaningful adaptation of the GM MTU to cause significant improvements in power and reactive strength during different jump-based assessments. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that the reproducibility of the techniques used to characterise GM MTU properties is generally acceptable to very good. Furthermore, specific GM MTU properties are related to lower limb power and reactive strength. Moreover, this thesis demonstrates that a three-month period of in-season soccer training is insufficient to elicit meaningful GM MTU adaptations required to improve physical performance. Therefore, whilst multiple factors contribute to influencing KPIs in ESP, this thesis presents novel information regarding the GM MTU and highlights potential physiological determinants that can be developed in youth soccer players.","The paper investigates the properties of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle-tendon unit and its relationship with power and reactive strength in elite youth soccer players. It establishes reliable assessment techniques for GM MTU properties and reveals that specific characteristics may influence lower limb performance, while also indicating that a 12-week in-season training program may not lead to significant adaptations in these parameters."
Injuries of Anterior Cruciate Ligament: A Review,2021-06-30,,,,"The anterior cruciate ligament is an important structure maintaining knee stability. ACL injuries are very commonly seen. They cause substantial effect in the younger population, mainly seen in sports injuries either by contact or non-contact mode, affects productivity and physical activity after injury, causes economic burden of surgeries and rehabilitation and post-operative complications. They fail to heal owing to various factors such as a low number of cells, poor vascularity, the inhibitory effect of synovial fluid. Newer approaches to surgeries are evolving to provide better treatment. Hence, a review will enrich the understanding of the pattern of ACL injuries and its application in novel ways of surgical repair.","This paper reviews the injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), highlighting their prevalence in sports and the significant impact they have on physical activity and socio-economic factors.

Biomechanical technology of injury prevention in the training of specialists in physical education and sports,2021-06-28,,,,"Purpose: to develop and experimentally test the biomechanical technology of injury prevention of future specialists in physical education and sports in the process of professional training (rock climbing for example). Material and Methods. The participants of this study were 84 male students engaged in amateur climbing aged 18-19 years. All athletes were also students of physical education faculties of Ukrainian universities; 40 athletes were in the experimental group and 44 athletes were in the control group. The biomechanical technology for injury prevention in the training of specialists in physical education and sports has been developed on rock climbing for example. Developed biomechanical technology for injury prevention contains 3 areas: 1 - theoretical; 2 - analytical; 3 - practical. Injury risk (incidence) was defined as the number of injuries to the total number of athletes in the analyzed group. Relative risk (incidence rate ratio) was determined by the ratio of risk in the control group to the risk in the experimental group. The chance of injury was defined as the ratio of the number of injuries to the number of uninjured athletes in the analyzed group. The relative chance (Odds Ratio) was defined as the chances of injury in the control group to the chances of injury in the experimental group. These indicators were determined separately for low, medium and severe finger injuries. Results. The applied technology of injury prevention significantly influences the reduction of the number of injuries of athletes – future specialists on the physical education and sports (on rock climbing for example). It is established that the application of the developed technology of injury prevention reduces the risk of finger injuries: low complexity – in 2.364 times (95% CI = 0.925-6.041, P&gt; 0,05) times; medium complexity – in 3.333 times (95% CI = 1.001-11.096, P (Fisher) = 0.030); high complexity – in 8.182 times (95% CI = 1.084-61.749, P (Fisher) = 0.011). Conclusions. The application of the developed biomechanical technology of injury prevention in the process of training specialists in physical education and sports significantly reduces the risk of injury to students.","The paper develops and tests a biomechanical technology focused on injury prevention for future specialists in physical education and sports, specifically in the context of rock climbing.

Effects of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis on Passive Neuromuscular Response and Mechanosensitivity in Athletes with Hamstring Shortening: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-06-18,,,,"Introduction. Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is defined as specific instrumental intervention to normalize function in the musculoskeletal system. It is considered a treatment method for the mechanical alterations of the locomotor system, and it is widely used in sports for therapeutic and preventive purposes. Despite the clinical benefits observed in different musculoskeletal conditions, the action mechanism of diacutaneous fibrolysis remains uncertain. There are no studies evaluating the neuromuscular response on the posterior muscular chain of the lower extremity in athletes, where overload, stiffness, and injury incidence are high. Objective. To evaluate the immediate, and 30 min post treatment effects of a single diacutaneous fibrolysis session on passive neuromuscular response and mechanosensitibity on hamstring and gluteus in athletes with shortening. Design. A randomized within participant clinical trial. Methods. Sixty-six athletes with hamstring shortening were included (PKE &lt; 160). The lower limbs were randomized between the experimental limb and control limb, regardless of dominance. A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis was applied to the posterior gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus of the experimental lower limb whereas the control limb was not treated. Viscoelastic muscle properties (myotonometry), contractile muscle properties (tensomiography), and mechanosensitivity (algometry) were tested before treatment (T0), after treatment (T1), and 30 min post treatment (T2). Results. Regarding viscoelastic properties, in the intra-group analysis we found statistically significant differences in the experimental limb at T1, decreasing muscle stiffness in gluteus maximus (p &lt; 0.042), in biceps femoris (p &lt; 0.001) and in semitendinosus (p &lt; 0.032). We also observed statistically significant differences in Tone decrease (p &lt; 0.011) and relaxation increase (p &lt; 0.001) in biceps femoris. At T2, the decrease in stiffness in all tested muscles was maintained (p &lt; 0.05). There were statistically significant inter-groups differences in stiffness on gluteus (p &lt; 0.048) and biceps femoris (p &lt; 0.019) and in tone on biceps femoris (p &lt; 0.009) compared to the control limb. For contractile properties, we only found statistically significant differences on maximal radial displacement (Dm) in gluteus, both control and experimental at T2 (p &lt; 0.05) and in biceps femoris control (p &lt; 0.030). No changes were found in the mechanosensitivity. Conclusions. A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis produces changes in some parameters related to viscoelasticity properties of the biceps femoris and gluteus.

Identifying degenerative effects of repetitive head trauma with neuroimaging: a clinically-oriented review,2021-05-22,,,,"Abstract Background and Scope of Review Varying severities and frequencies of head trauma may result in dynamic acute and chronic pathophysiologic responses in the brain. Heightened attention to long-term effects of head trauma, particularly repetitive head trauma, has sparked recent efforts to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of underlying disease processes. Imaging modalities like structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the most clinically applicable given their use in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and differentiation. In recent years, researchers have targeted repetitive head trauma cohorts in hopes of identifying in vivo biomarkers for underlying biologic changes that might ultimately improve diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in living persons. These populations most often include collision sport athletes (e.g., American football, boxing) and military veterans with repetitive low-level blast exposure. We provide a clinically-oriented review of neuroimaging data from repetitive head trauma cohorts based on structural MRI, FDG-PET, Aβ-PET, and tau-PET. We supplement the review with two patient reports of neuropathology-confirmed, clinically impaired adults with prior repetitive head trauma who underwent structural MRI, FDG-PET, Aβ-PET, and tau-PET in addition to comprehensive clinical examinations before death. Review Conclusions Group-level comparisons to controls without known head trauma have revealed inconsistent regional volume differences, with possible propensity for medial temporal, limbic, and subcortical (thalamus, corpus callosum) structures. Greater frequency and severity (i.e., length) of cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is observed in repetitive head trauma cohorts compared to unexposed controls. It remains unclear whether CSP predicts a particular neurodegenerative process, but CSP presence should increase suspicion that clinical impairment is at least partly attributable to the individual’s head trauma exposure (regardless of underlying disease). PET imaging similarly has not revealed a prototypical metabolic or molecular pattern associated with repetitive head trauma or predictive of CTE based on the most widely studied radiotracers. Given the range of clinical syndromes and neurodegenerative pathologies observed in a subset of adults with prior repetitive head trauma, structural MRI and PET imaging may still be useful for differential diagnosis (e.g., assessing suspected Alzheimer’s disease).","This paper reviews the use of neuroimaging techniques, including structural MRI and PET, to identify biomarkers associated with the effects of repetitive head trauma, particularly in collision sports and military veterans. The findings highlight inconsistencies in neuroimaging results and suggest that while certain imaging features may indicate cognitive impairment related to head trauma, a clear predictive pattern for neurodegenerative processes like chronic traumatic encephalopathy remains unclear."
Analysis Choices Impact Movement Evaluation: A Multi-Aspect Inferential Method Applied to Kinematic Curves of Vertical Hops in Knee-Injured and Asymptomatic Persons,2021-05-14,,,,"Three-dimensional human motion analysis provides in-depth understanding in order to optimize sports performance or rehabilitation following disease or injury. Recent developments of statistical methods for functional data allow for novel ways to analyze often complex biomechanical data. Even so, for such methods as well as for traditional well-established statistical methods, the interpretations of the results may be influenced by analysis choices made prior to the analysis. We evaluated the consequences of three such choices when comparing one-leg vertical hop (OLVH) performance in individuals who had ruptured their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), to that of asymptomatic controls, and also athletes. Kinematic data were analyzed using a statistical approach for functional data, targeting entire curve data. This was done not only for one joint at a time but also for multiple lower limb joints and movement planes simultaneously using a multi-aspect methodology, testing for group differences while also accounting for covariates. We present the results of when an individual representative curve out of three available was either: (1) a mean curve ( Mean ), (2) a curve from the highest hop ( Max ), or (3) a curve describing the variability ( Var ), as a representation of performance stability. We also evaluated choice of sample leg comparison; e.g., ACL-injured leg compared to either the dominant or non-dominant leg of asymptomatic groups. Finally, we explored potential outcome effects of different combinations of included joints. There were slightly more pronounced group differences when using Mean compared to Max , while the specifics of the observed differences depended on the outcome variable. For Var there were less significant group differences. Generally, there were more disparities throughout the hop movement when comparing the injured leg to the dominant leg of controls, resulting in e.g., group differences for trunk and ankle kinematics, for both Mean and Max . When the injured leg was instead compared to the non-dominant leg of controls, there were trunk, hip and knee joint differences. For a more stringent comparison, we suggest considering to compare the injured leg to the non-dominant leg. Finally, the multiple-joint analyses were coherent with the single-joint analyses. The direct effects of analysis choices can be explored interactively by the reader in the Supplementary Material . To summarize, the choices definitively have an impact on the interpretation of a hop test results commonly used in rehabilitation following knee injuries. We therefore strongly recommend well-documented methodological analysis choices with regards to comparisons and representative values of the measures of interests.","This paper evaluates the impact of analysis choices on the interpretation of one-leg vertical hop performance in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries compared to asymptomatic controls. It highlights how different methods of representing kinematic data—mean curves, maximum curves, and variability—significantly affect the observed group differences, underscoring the need for careful methodological documentation in biomechanical assessments."
The non-sagittal knee moment vector identifies ‘at risk’ individuals that the knee abduction moment alone does not,2021-05-05,,,,"Multi-planar forces and moments are known to injure the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). In ACL injury risk studies, however, the uni-planar frontal plane external knee abduction moment is frequently studied in isolation. This study aimed to determine if the frontal plane knee moment (KM-Y) could classify all individuals crossing a risk threshold compared to those classified by a multi-planar non-sagittal knee moment vector (KM-YZ). Recreationally active females completed three sports tasks-drop vertical jumps, single-leg drop vertical jumps and planned sidesteps. Peak knee abduction moments and peak non-sagittal resultant knee moments were obtained for each task, and a risk threshold of the sample mean plus 1.6 standard deviations was used for classification. A sensitivity analysis of the threshold from 1-2 standard deviations was also conducted. KM-Y did not identify all participants who crossed the risk threshold as the non-sagittal moment identified unique individuals. This result was consistent across tasks and threshold sensitivities. Analysing the peak uni-planar knee abduction moment alone is therefore likely overly reductionist, as this study demonstrates that a KM-YZ threshold identifies 'at risk' individuals that a KM-Y threshold does not. Multi-planar moment metrics such as KM-YZ may help facilitate the development of screening protocols across multiple tasks.","This paper examines the limitations of using the frontal plane knee abduction moment (KM-Y) in identifying individuals at risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. It highlights that a multi-planar non-sagittal knee moment vector (KM-YZ) can identify additional at-risk individuals, suggesting the need for more comprehensive screening protocols that account for multi-planar forces in ACL injury risk assessments."
Excellent Functional Outcomes and Low Complication Rates Following Knotless Arthroscopic Bankart Repair: A Systematic Review of Clinical and Biomechanical Studies,2021-05-05,,,,"To provide a comprehensive review of the current clinical and biomechanical evidence for the use of knotless suture anchors during arthroscopic Bankart repair.A comprehensive search of 5 electronic databases from inception to July 2020 was performed for clinical and biomechanical studies in English evaluating outcomes following arthroscopic Bankart repair using knotless suture anchors. Two independent reviewers assessed articles for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORs) criteria. Clinical outcomes of interest and key findings from biomechanical studies were summarized.Ten clinical studies (430 knotless repairs), including 4 cohort studies directly comparing knotless (N = 117) to knot-tying repairs (N = 192), were deemed eligible. Four biomechanical studies were also identified. Heterogeneity and the lack of randomized studies precluded data pooling and quantitative meta-analysis. Rates of redislocation ranged from 2.2% to 14.7% and 1.5% to 23.8% for knot-tying and knotless repair, respectively. Both knot-tying and knotless repair demonstrated excellent postoperative functional outcome, as assessed by visual analog scale, Constant-Murley, Rowe, and QuickDASH scores, with 80% to 94% of patients returning to sports participation. Biomechanical studies showed similar stiffness and load to failure between knot-tying and knotless repairs, with the most common mode of failure being retear at the suture-soft tissue interface.Current level II to IV clinical and biomechanical evidence supports knotless arthroscopic Bankart repair as an effective procedure with excellent functional outcomes and low rates of complication and reoperation.Level IV, systematic review of level II to IV studies.","The paper provides a systematic review of clinical and biomechanical evidence regarding the use of knotless suture anchors in arthroscopic Bankart repair. Key findings indicate that both knotless and knot-tying techniques yield excellent functional outcomes and low complication rates, with comparable biomechanical properties in terms of stiffness and load to failure."
CORR Insights®: Is Cam Morphology Found in Ancient and Medieval Populations in Addition to Modern Populations?,2021-05-05,,,,"Where Are We Now? Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) results from abnormal contact between the proximal femur and the rim of the acetabulum. The most common morphology found in patients with symptomatic FAI is the cam morphology, which is characterized by an aspherical shape at the femoral-head neck junction. It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to known pathological processes such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) [2]. Studies have disagreed as to whether the cam morphology is a product of modern activities or whether it was present in historical or even ancient populations. Some studies have found evidence of cam morphology in ancient and older 20th century populations [8, 15], while another study examining the osteology from an indigenous North American population from approximately 1000 years ago did not find evidence of cam morphology, suggesting it may be a modern phenomenon [10]. Here, Musielak and colleagues [11] present a radiological study using osteology specimens examining the prevalence of cam morphology among two different ancient populations (Neolithic population from Iran and Medieval population from Poland) and one modern population (Australian aborigines) [11]. The authors found that cam morphology was present across all three populations at comparable levels of frequency (between 3% to 7%), and male specimens were more likely to have cam morphology relative to female specimens, which is supportive of prior work [8, 15] suggesting that cam morphology is not purely a modern phenomenon. The prevalence of cam morphology in modern populations appears to be more common than it is in the populations studied by Musielak et al. [11], with a range between 5% to 40% in asymptomatic volunteers with variation among the population studied, measurement technique (plain radiography, cross-sectional imaging), and sex, suggesting that modern lifestyles may exacerbate its development [6, 13]. Based on these discoveries, cam development is likely multifactorial and includes both biological/genetic contributions, as shown by the sex-based differences across a variety of different populations, and activity-related contributions, as illustrated by the different incidence rates across different historical populations compared to modern populations. Where Do We Need To Go? Recent studies [1, 3, 6, 12, 13] suggest a multifactorial origin to cam morphology, and further studies are needed to identify the relative contributions of these risk factors. One commonly associated risk factor is physical activity during skeletal immaturity. Cam morphology is thought to originate as an adaptive response to stresses across the capital femoral epiphysis during skeletal maturation, and participation in vigorous sporting activities prior to growth plate closure is thought to be one of the primary sources of cam morphology in modern populations [12]. For example, cam morphology is found more commonly after physeal closure and has a low prevalence in skeletally immature patients, suggesting that it develops around the time of growth plate closure [3]. Participation in youth athletics may contribute to these changes, for instance, an increased prevalence of anterosuperior flattening of the femoral head-neck junction developed over a mean 2-year period in adolescent soccer players close to skeletal maturity [1]. Additionally, increased development of cam morphology was seen in youth hockey players on MRI, most frequently developing at the time of final growth spurt for the capital femoral epiphysis between ages 13 to 16 [7]. While there appears to be an association of youth sports around the time of skeletal maturity with cam deformity, little work has been done to study ways to reduce the stresses across the hip by altering the intensity or the components of sports participation in an attempt to reduce proximal femoral remodeling. Additionally, the role of early surgical or nonsurgical intervention to change the developmental trajectory of these deformities remains unclear. Another risk factor is developmental pathology of the capital femoral epiphyseal region, such as clinical or subclinical SCFE. Subtle SCFE deformities have been observed in the setting of cam FAI, suggesting that this may also contribute to the development of cam morphology seen at skeletal maturity [2]. Additionally, differences in bony morphology of the epiphyseal tubercle relative to the metaphyseal fossa may affect the relative stability of the growth plate during development, and compensatory mechanisms such as increased epiphy-seal peripheral cupping may ultimately contribute to the development of cam morphology [9]. Another important area of study is the relative contribution of these deformities to future osteoarthritis development. Cam morphology is commonly found in older patients who participated in athletic activities during their lifetime, but this is not necessarily associated with osteoarthritis development, suggesting that further knowledge about the role of cam morphology in osteoarthritis progression is needed to identify the subset of patients who will develop symptomatic osteoarthritis [7]. While biomechanical forces across the growth plate appear to contribute to cam morphologies, they don’t explain their development in all situations. This leaves open the possibility of a biological contribution or genetic differences in structural morphology of the hip as a contribution to cam development and progression to osteoarthritis [10], which future studies ought to investigate. How Do We Get There? Large, cross-sectional, prospective, population-based studies have a strong precedent in osteoarthritis research and would be the most influential in defining the origin and natural history of cam morphology in modern populations [5]. Smaller studies have already provided some insight into the origins of cam development, but more research is needed across a diverse range of ages, sexes, geographical distributions, and activity demands including both sedentary patients to competitive athletes. Radiological imaging of the capital femoral epiphysis in both non-sports participants and sports participants from the time of skeletal immaturity until after skeletal maturity will provide insight into the process of cam development and its association with athletic activities or pathological processes of the growth plate. Additionally, these studies may shed light on the populations of patients who may benefit from early surgical or nonsurgical interventions. For instance, loss of hip internal rotation secondary to cam morphology was associated with increased risk of early radiological degenerative changes in adolescent patients [14]. Further insight into the biological development of cam morphology and the progression of osteoarthritis in the setting of FAI would also be beneficial to understanding the underlying pathological mechanisms. For instance, in vivo models that recapitulate cam morphology development provide a controlled setting to understand the relative contributions of biological factors and biomechanical factors that lead to cam development and intra-articular injury [16]. Additionally, human retrieval studies using biological tissues such as peripheral blood, synovial tissue, and cartilage tissue in affected patients may provide further insights into the development of FAI [4] and osteoarthritis progression.","This paper investigates the prevalence of cam morphology in ancient, medieval, and modern populations and explores the contributing factors to its development. It finds that cam morphology exists across different populations, suggesting it is not solely a modern phenomenon but may be influenced by biological factors and physical activity, particularly during the period of skeletal maturation, with implications for future research on its relationship with osteoarthritis."

Rapid Estimation of Entire Brain Strain Using Deep Learning Models,2021-04-14,,,,"Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformation resulting from a head impact is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain deformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE head models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This work aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature engineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a combination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in less than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a standard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and model initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive power of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features based on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head impacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of brain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended by incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: In addition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation monitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a large number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models.","This paper focuses on the rapid estimation of brain strain resulting from head impacts, particularly in sports like football and mixed martial arts. Utilizing a deep learning model trained on 1803 head impact events, the study achieves quick and accurate calculations of brain deformation, which holds potential for clinical applications and improved real-time monitoring of brain injuries."
Sex and Limb Differences in Lower Extremity Alignment and Kinematics during Drop Vertical Jumps,2021-04-03,,,,"Sex and limb differences in lower extremity alignments (LEAs) and dynamic lower extremity kinematics (LEKs) during a drop vertical jump were investigated in participants of Korean ethnicity. One hundred healthy males and females participated in a drop vertical jump, and LEAs and LEKs were determined in dominant and non-dominant limbs. A 2-by-2 mixed model MANOVA was performed to compare LEAs and joint kinematics between sexes and limbs (dominant vs. non-dominant). Compared with males, females possessed a significantly greater pelvic tilt, femoral anteversion, Q-angle, and reduced tibial torsion. Females landed on the ground with significantly increased knee extension and ankle plantarflexion with reduced hip abduction and knee adduction, relatively decreased peak hip adduction, knee internal rotation, and increased knee abduction and ankle eversion. The non-dominant limb showed significantly increased hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation; knee flexion and internal rotation; and ankle inversion at initial contact. Further, the non-dominant limb showed increased peak hip and knee flexion, relatively reduced peak hip adduction, and increased knee abduction and internal rotation. It could be suggested that LEAs and LEKs observed in females and non-dominant limbs might contribute to a greater risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries.","This paper investigates sex and limb differences in lower extremity alignments and kinematics during drop vertical jumps among healthy Korean participants. Findings indicate that females exhibit distinct kinematic patterns and alignments compared to males, and the non-dominant limb shows specific variations that could increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries."
P077 Upskilling rheumatology therapists in work rehabilitation: an evaluation of the Workwell training programme,2021-04-01,,,,"Abstract Background/Aims Keeping people with arthritis working is an important goal of rehabilitation. Rheumatology therapists may provide work advice to employed patients but conducting a structured work assessment and providing vocational rehabilitation (VR) is unusual. As part of a VR trial, we developed a VR training course (Workwell). The course consisted of 3 elements: a pre-training self-study module (reading on ergonomics and activity analysis; activity analysis of at least 2 videos of people working; observing people working); a 2-day training course (how to conduct a structured work interview (the Work Environment Survey: WES); case studies; planning work interventions; practical workshops about VR strategies and solutions; addressing disclosure; writing reports); followed by a 1:1 one hour telephone call practising conducting the WES with a trainer, developing a treatment plan, and individual feedback. A “Workwell Solutions Manual” was also provided for use in practice, with information on legislation, patient booklets and work solutions linked to problems identified in the WES. Our aim was to evaluate therapists’ views about the course and its impact. Methods All therapists attending the Workwell course were asked to complete questionnaires pre- and post-training. These included: knowledge of and confidence in providing VR (measured on a 0-4 scale of very limited to excellent); the Evidence Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS); and views about course content and duration. Results Three courses were delivered: 32/40 attendees completed pre-and-post training questionnaires. All were occupational therapists (OTs): 30 women and 2 men; 2 NHS Band 5, 15 Band 6, 11 Band 7 and 4 Band 8; with 11 (SD 7) years’ experience in Rheumatology. Median scores of Knowledge of: VR; the VR process; VR strategies; relevant legislation and policies; and Confidence in: conducting a work assessment; and identifying work solutions, significantly increased from 1 (limited: IQR 1-2) to 3 (good: IQR 2-3) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Total EBPAS scores did not change. However, Openness sub-scale scores did (i.e. extent to which willing to use new research -based interventions): Pre 2 (moderate: IQR2-3) to Post 3 (great: IQR 3-3): p = 0.04. Most (i.e. 26-30) considered very/extremely relevant: the pre-training self-study; conducting the WES and case studies; practical workshops (workstation assessment; upper limb strategies; load handling; environment; disclosure); and the post-training 1:1 practice WES, treatment planning and feedback. The training about using the WES (roleplay by trainers; case studies and 1:1 telephone practice) was considered the most beneficial aspect. Of the 21 commenting on course length, 16 considered it about right and 5 wanted longer. Conclusion The 2-day VR course, plus 2 days self-study, led to significant improvements in knowledge and confidence in delivering VR amongst attending OTs. Work is a key component of OT.

Integrating a Potentiometer into a Knee Brace Shows High Potential for Continuous Knee Motion Monitoring,2021-03-19,,,,"Continuous monitoring of knee motion can provide deep insights into patients’ rehabilitation status after knee injury and help to better identify their individual therapeutic needs. Potentiometers have been identified as one possible sensor type for continuous monitoring of knee motion. However, to verify their use in monitoring real-life environments, further research is needed. We aimed to validate a potentiometer-embedded knee brace to measure sagittal knee kinematics during various daily activities, as well as to assess its potential to continuously monitor knee motion. To this end, the sagittal knee motion of 32 healthy subjects was recorded simultaneously by an instrumented knee brace and an optoelectronic reference system during activities of daily living to assess the agreement between these two measurement systems. To evaluate the potentiometer’s behavior during continuous monitoring, knee motion was continuously recorded in a subgroup (n = 9) who wore the knee brace over the course of a day. Our results show a strong agreement between the instrumented knee brace and reference system across all investigated activities as well as stable sensor behavior during continuous tracking. The presented potentiometer-based sensor system demonstrates strong potential as a device for measuring sagittal knee motion during daily activities as well as for continuous knee motion monitoring.","This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a potentiometer-embedded knee brace for continuous monitoring of knee motion during daily activities in healthy subjects.

"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Australian Rules Football: Incidence, Prevention and Return to Play Outcomes",2021-03-01,,,,"Abstract: Australian Rules football is the most popular of the various codes of football played in Australia. During the game players perform frequent landing, cutting and pivoting manoeuvres that expose them to substantial risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Recent years have seen the introduction of a professional women's league that has resulted in an exponential growth in the participation of women and girls in this sport. Unfortunately, there is a corresponding growth in ACL injury rates in female players. This review summarizes the incidence of ACL injury in both men's and women's Australian Rules football and reviews potential causative factors and risk reduction strategies. The final section takes an in depth look at return to sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery in these populations. Whilst an ACL injury does not mean the end of a player's career in Australian football, it certainly presents a significant challenge in terms of return to preinjury levels of form and high rates of secondary and tertiary ACL injury are also a significant concern. Keywords: Australian football, knee injury, ACL, injury prevalence, return to play","This paper provides a comprehensive review of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in Australian Rules football, highlighting the increasing incidence among both male and female players due to high-risk movements like cutting and pivoting.

Practical experiential learning: a methodology approach for teaching undergraduate biomechanics,2021-01-13,,,,"Biomechanics is the field of study that examines different physical characteristics of the human body combined with the principles of Newtonian mechanics. This discipline requires competency in algebra, trigonometry, and physics, which is particularly challenging for many students pursuing an undergraduate degree in kinesiology. This paper presents the development and implementation of a biomechanics instructional approach for kinesiology undergraduate students using active-experimental learning sections. Focused on integrating acquired knowledge and applied real-life examples via hands-on experiences, the students work in small groups to complete five lab activities and a final project.

Blood-brain barrier disruption and ventricular enlargement are the earliest neuropathological changes in rats with repeated sub-concussive impacts over 2 weeks,2021-01-12,,,,"Abstract Repeated sub-concussive impact ( e.g. soccer ball heading), a significantly lighter form of mild traumatic brain injury, is increasingly suggested to cumulatively alter brain structure and compromise neurobehavioural function in the long-term. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby repeated long-term sub-concussion induces cerebral structural and neurobehavioural changes are currently unknown. Here, we utilised an established rat model to investigate the effects of repeated sub-concussion on size of lateral ventricles, cerebrovascular blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and biochemical distribution. Following repeated sub-concussion for 2 weeks, the rats showed significantly enlarged lateral ventricles compared with the rats receiving sham-only procedure. The sub-concussive rats also presented significant BBB dysfunction in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, whilst neuromotor function assessed by beamwalk and rotarod tests were comparable to the sham rats. Immunofluorescent and spectroscopic microscopy analyses revealed no significant changes in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, lipid distribution or protein aggregation, within the hippocampus and cortex. These data collectively indicate that repeated sub-concussion for 2 weeks induce significant ventriculomegaly and BBB disruption, preceding neuromotor deficits.","The paper investigates the early neuropathological changes associated with repeated sub-concussive impacts, such as soccer ball heading, using a rat model. Key findings include significant enlargement of lateral ventricles and disruption of the blood-brain barrier after two weeks of repeated sub-concussive impacts, indicating potential long-term risks to cerebral structure and neurobehavioural function without immediate neuromotor deficits."
[Retracted] 3D Kinematic Analysis of Intelligent Vision Sensor Image in Football Training,2021-01-01,,,,"With its advantages of high precision, noncontact, and high intelligence, intelligent visual sensor detection technology meets the requirements for online detection of motion status and intelligent recognition of motion images during sports activities, and its applications are becoming more and more extensive. In order to deeply explore the feasibility of using intelligent vision sensor technology to analyze the three‐dimensional action of football, this article uses algorithm analysis method, technology summary method, and physical assembly method, collects samples, analyzes the motion model, streamlines the algorithm, and then creates a model based on intelligent visual sensor technology that can analyze the three‐dimensional movement in football training. After the experimental objects are selected, the model is established in the ADM environment. All athletes do a uniform motion, the standard input motion speed is 5 m/s, they all move in the opposite direction relative to their respective coordinate axes, and the motion time is 6 seconds. The results show that the movement curves of the athletes in the three coordinate axis directions are basically the same. When the exercise time is 6 seconds, the coordinate values of the athletes on the three coordinate axes are all 0.992 m. We set six intensities in the experiment: 5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, and 55%. It can be found that as the noise intensity increases from 5% to 45%, the estimation error gradually increases, but as a whole, it is still at a relatively small level. It shows that the algorithm in this paper still has practical significance. It is basically realized that under the guidance of intelligent vision sensor technology, a model can be designed to successfully and efficiently analyze the three‐dimensional movement pattern in training.","This paper explores the application of intelligent vision sensor technology for analyzing three-dimensional movements in football training. It details the development of a model that effectively utilizes this technology to detect and analyze athletes' movement patterns, demonstrating consistency in kinematic data despite varying noise levels."
