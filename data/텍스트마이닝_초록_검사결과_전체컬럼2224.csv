A 6-Week Nine-Square Exercise Programme for Collegiate Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability: A Randomised Controlled Trial,2022-12-22,2022,Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia,Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences,"Kanok-On Thanasootr, Torkamol Hunsawong, Uraiwan Chatchawan, Wantana Siritaratiwat","Background: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) have poor postural stability, functional limitations and low quality of life. Although nine-square exercise can improve postural control, there is limited evidence demonstrating whether it can function as an alternative CAI rehabilitation programme. This study aimed to determine the effects of nine-square exercise on postural stability and self-reported outcomes in individuals with CAI. Methods: Eighteen male collegiate athletes with CAI participated in either a 6-week nine-square exercise or a control group (n = 9 per group). At baseline and post-intervention, the participants undertook clinical tests to measures dynamic and static postural control, and self- reported outcomes regarding ankle stability and function. Results: Within-group differences, the nine-square exercise group experienced improved dynamic postural control (P = 0.004), static postural control (P = 0.001) and self-reported outcomes (P &lt; 0.05). For the control group, only static postural control improved (P = 0.018). Post- intervention, the nine-square exercise group experienced significant improvements in dynamic postural control (P &lt; 0.001), ankle stability (P = 0.002) and functional ability (P &lt; 0.05) relative to the control group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the nine-square exercise can offer an alternative rehabilitation programme for improving postural control, self-perceived ankle stability and functional ability in CAI.",1
"Estimating Ground Reaction Forces from Two-Dimensional Pose Data: A Biomechanics-Based Comparison of AlphaPose, BlazePose, and OpenPose",2022-12-21,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Marion Mundt, Zachery Born, Molly Goldacre, Jacqueline Alderson","The adoption of computer vision pose estimation approaches, used to identify keypoint locations which are intended to reflect the necessary anatomical landmarks relied upon by biomechanists for musculoskeletal modelling, has gained increasing traction in recent years. This uptake has been further accelerated by keypoint use as inputs into machine learning models used to estimate biomechanical parameters such as ground reaction forces (GRFs) in the absence of instrumentation required for direct measurement. This study first aimed to investigate the keypoint detection rate of three open-source pose estimation models (AlphaPose, BlazePose, and OpenPose) across varying movements, camera views, and trial lengths. Second, this study aimed to assess the suitability and interchangeability of keypoints detected by each pose estimation model when used as inputs into machine learning models for the estimation of GRFs. The keypoint detection rate of BlazePose was distinctly lower than that of AlphaPose and OpenPose. All pose estimation models achieved a high keypoint detection rate at the centre of an image frame and a lower detection rate in the true sagittal plane camera field of view, compared with slightly anteriorly or posteriorly located quasi-sagittal plane camera views. The three-dimensional ground reaction force, instantaneous loading rate, and peak force for running could be estimated using the keypoints of all three pose estimation models. However, only AlphaPose and OpenPose keypoints could be used interchangeably with a machine learning model trained to estimate GRFs based on AlphaPose keypoints resulting in a high estimation accuracy when OpenPose keypoints were used as inputs and vice versa. The findings of this study highlight the need for further evaluation of computer vision-based pose estimation models for application in biomechanical human modelling, and the limitations of machine learning-based GRF estimation models that rely on 2D keypoints. This is of particular relevance given that machine learning models informing athlete monitoring guidelines are being developed for application related to athlete well-being.",1
Sport-related concussion attitudes and knowledge in elite English female footballers,2022-12-21,2022,Informa UK Limited,Science and Medicine in Football,"Andrew Shafik, Pippa Bennett, Craig Rosenbloom, Katrine Okholm Kryger, Sean Carmody, Jonathan Power",Background Sport-related concussions (SRC) are more common and more severe in women's football than men's yet the knowledge and attitudes of SRC in the women's game are not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the SRC knowledge and attitude in elite female footballers.Methods An online questionnaire was sent to all registered players in the English Football Association Women's Super League (WSL) and Championship. Respondents completed an amended version of the Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitudes Survey (RoCKAS). Concussion Knowledge Index (CKI) and Concussion Attitudes Index (CAI) scores were derived for all respondents.Results One hundred and twenty-three players completed the survey with 111 fitting the inclusion criteria. The mean CKI score was 20.5 ± 2.3 and the mean CAI score was 63.3 ± 6.3. A weak positive correlation was shown between the CKI and CAI (r = 0.20; p = 0.03). Previous concussion education had a significant impact on increased knowledge (U = 1198; p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in concussion attitudes and knowledge between the WSL and Championship or in those with a previous concussion history and no previous concussion (p > 0.05).Conclusion Previous SRC education demonstrated an increased knowledge around concussion but a limited impact towards concussion attitudes. It is suggested that concussion education should be mandated across the professional game to enhance player welfare.,1
Physiotherapy Rehabilitation Management on Phase I of Post Operative Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Case Report,2022-12-30,2022,"DiscoverSys, Inc.",Indonesia Journal of Biomedical Science,"I Putu Gde Surya Adhitya, Ari Wibawa, Abdurrasyid, I Gusti Ngurah Wien Aryana, Muhammad Adrian Putra Rachman, Ni Luh Veni Rahayu, Ni Komang Mega Junianti, Emily Devina Kartawijaya, Tabita Febyola Wijaya","Background: An anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) phase I is critical for the patient to improve knee pain and range of motion (ROM), knee functions, and prevent excessive inflammation and muscle atrophy. This study aims to evaluate the physiotherapy interventions to improve the pain, ROM, muscle atrophy, and knee function following ACLR phase I. Case Description: In July 2022, a 22-year-old female basketball athlete injured her right knee while running-pivoting movement during practice. The patient received ACLR on September 22, 2022, following an MRI and physiotherapy examinations. On October 14, 2022, the patient began receiving three times physiotherapy programs weekly. Until November 11, 2022, she complained of having trouble bending and straightening her knee. Although there was no increment in leg muscle circumference of 20 cm above the right patella (RP), there were increments in muscle circumferences of 1.3 cm at 10 cm above the RP, 1.1 cm at 5 cm above the RP, 1.2 cm at 10 cm below the RP, and 1.5 cm at 20 cm below the RP. After three times interventions, we found changes 5o of knee flexion, 2 points of tenderness VAS, 5-28 points of KOOS score, and 10 points of Lysholm’s score. Conclusion: The physiotherapy interventions improved the pain, ROM, leg muscle circumference, and knee function in the ACLR phase I patient. This case report study could be a reference for further experimental study.",1
"Sports-related concussion: assessing the comprehension, collaboration, and contribution of chiropractors",2022-12-27,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Chiropractic &amp; Manual Therapies,"Nicholas Shannon, Jon Patricios","Over the last 2 decades, sports-related concussion (SRC) awareness and management have evolved from an emphasis on complete cognitive and physical rest to evidence-based protocols and interventions. Chiropractors are primary care providers with exposure to athletes and teams in collision sports and, in addition, manage patients with concussion-like symptoms including neck pain, dizziness, and headache. With SRC frequently occurring in the absence of a medical practitioner, the role of allied health practitioners like chiropractors should be emphasised when it comes to the recognition, assessment, and management of SRC. This commentary discusses the potential contribution of chiropractors in SRC and the specific role their expertise in the cervical spine may play in symptom evaluation and management. A PubMed and Google scholar review of the chiropractic SRC literature suggests that the chiropractic profession appears under-represented in concussion research in athletic populations compared to other medical and allied health fields. This includes an absence of chiropractic clinicians with a focus on SRC participating in the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) and the International Consensus Conferences on Concussion. Furthermore, with evolving evidence suggesting the importance of cervicogenic manifestations in SRC, there is an opportunity for chiropractors to participate in SRC diagnosis and management more fully and contribute scientifically to an area of specialised knowledge and training. With a dearth of chiropractic orientated SRC science, clinical SRC expertise, and clinical chiropractic representation in the CISG; it is incumbent on chiropractic clinicians and scientists to take up this opportunity through meaningful contribution and involvement in the SRC field.",1
Plantar Fascia Lateral Fascicle Rupture: How Severe Can It Be?,2022-12-27,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Miguel De Castro Correia, Tiago Rodrigues Lopes","The plantar fascia is a thick and strong group of longitudinal and transverse bands of collagen-rich tissue, consisting of central, medial, and lateral fascicles. Biomechanically, the central fascicle assumes a special role in medial longitudinal foot arch preservation. However, there is scarce data on plantar fascia medial and lateral fascicles' anatomy and pathology in the literature. We report the case of a 27-year-old male professional soccer player who presented with sudden-onset, severe lateral right rearfoot pain that had started while doing linear sprinting practice. The athlete had no relevant medical history and no history of previous right foot injuries. The radiographic study of the right foot revealed no significant changes. MRI showed a high T2 signal partially interrupting the plantar fascia lateral fascicle low signal, consistent with a lateral fascicle rupture. The rehabilitation program was initiated and included pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. He experienced an extremely favorable evolution of his condition with the absence of pain and partial weight bearing in less than one week, with a full return to sports in approximately two weeks. During dynamic foot movement, the lateral fascicle seems to be less biomechanically recruited compared to the central one; however, the strain is not negligible and might be the reason for the pathology. Still, this slightly decreased strain might explain this injury's faster healing time compared to that associated with the central fascicle. Regarding the risk factors for plantar fascia ruptures, it should be kept in mind that a tear might occur even in their absence. We intend to raise awareness about the existence of plantar fascia lateral fascicle and the possibility of associated pathology, either acute or chronic. Hopefully, in the near future, plantar fascia ruptures will get significantly more attention in the literature, enabling the creation of proper management guidelines.",1
Sport and non-specific low back pain in athletes: a scoping review,2022-12-23,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Fulvio Dal Farra, Federico Arippa, Giuseppe Carta, Marco Segreto, Elisa Porcu, Marco Monticone","The contribution of sport in non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) remains unknown, due to a large heterogeneity in the methods applied in research. The aims of this scoping review (ScR) were to systematically map and summarize findings concerning studies reporting data on NS-LBP among athletes.This ScR was developed referring to the 2020 version of the ""Joanna Briggs Institute Methodological Guidance"" and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews. Five medical databases (Pubmed, Cochrane, Central, Embase, Pedro and Scopus) were searched up to November 2021. No limitations in terms of study design and language were applied. Results were presented numerically and thematically.A total of 4061 records were identified through the initial search; 114 articles met the inclusion criteria. Publications have increased over the years, since 1990. Most of the studies were conducted in the USA (17.5%), even if most research was conducted in Europe (53.5%). Analytic observational (42%) and cross-sectional studies (37%) were the most used designs, followed by case reports (12%) and systematic reviews (9%). Boating (7%), football, soccer, volleyball, running and gymnastics (4.4% each) were the most investigated, although the majority of the studies considered sports in general (36.8%). The overall sample size median was 181, mean age 22 ± 10.2; 68% of athletes were professional and 32% amateur. Most of the studies (38%) did not detail the frequency of training. Sport was reported as a risk factor for developing NS-LBP in 67.5% of cases, especially in those studies which assessed activities implying high or repeated loading on the spine.This is the first ScR to provide a comprehensive overview on this topic. The increased number of publications on the association between sport practice and NS-LBP demonstrates a growing interest over the years on this topic. Some sport activities seem to be more involved than others in LBP development; however, research methods are extremely varied, thus more standardized observational research may focus on specific disciplines to properly contribute to research and clinical practice.",1

The biomechanical signature of loss of consciousness: computational modelling of elite athlete head injuries,2022-12-22,2022,Oxford University Press (OUP),Brain,"Karl A Zimmerman, Janie Cournoyer, Helen Lai, Samuel B Snider, David Fischer, Simon Kemp, Clara Karton, Thomas B Hoshizaki, Mazdak Ghajari, David J Sharp","Abstract Sports related head injuries can cause transient neurological events including loss of consciousness and dystonic posturing. However, it is unknown why head impacts that appear similar produce distinct neurological effects. The biomechanical effect of impacts can be estimated using computational models of strain within the brain. Here, we investigate the strain and strain rates produced by professional American football impacts that led to loss of consciousness, posturing or no neurological signs. We reviewed 1280 National Football League American football games and selected cases where the team’s medical personnel made a diagnosis of concussion. Videos were then analysed for signs of neurological events. We identified 20 head impacts that showed clear video signs of loss of consciousness and 21 showing clear abnormal posturing. Forty-one control impacts were selected where there was no observable evidence of neurological signs, resulting in 82 videos of impacts for analysis. Video analysis was used to guide physical reconstructions of these impacts, allowing us to estimate the impact kinematics. These were then used as input to a detailed 3D high-fidelity finite element model of brain injury biomechanics to estimate strain and strain rate within the brain. We tested the hypotheses that impacts producing loss of consciousness would be associated with the highest biomechanical forces, that loss of consciousness would be associated with high forces in brainstem nuclei involved in arousal and that dystonic posturing would be associated with high forces in motor regions. Impacts leading to loss of consciousness compared to controls produced higher head acceleration (linear acceleration; 81.5 g ± 39.8 versus 47.9 ± 21.4; P = 0.004, rotational acceleration; 5.9 krad/s2 ± 2.4 versus 3.5 ± 1.6; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in voxel-wise analysis produced larger brain deformation in many brain regions, including parts of the brainstem and cerebellum. Dystonic posturing was also associated with higher deformation compared to controls, with brain deformation observed in cortical regions that included the motor cortex. Loss of consciousness was specifically associated with higher strain rates in brainstem regions implicated in maintenance of consciousness, including following correction for the overall severity of impact. These included brainstem nuclei including the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphé and parabrachial complex. The results show that in head impacts producing loss of consciousness, brain deformation is disproportionately seen in brainstem regions containing nuclei involved in arousal, suggesting that head impacts produce loss of consciousness through a biomechanical effect on key brainstem nuclei involved in the maintenance of consciousness.",1

This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the evidence for recurrent concussion incidence between male and female athletes across various sports. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources - PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies - Studies written in English containing sex comparisons of recurrent concussion data published between January 2000 and June 2021 were included. RESULTS: A total of 1,509 records were identified, of which 114 studies were assessed for eligibility with full-text review. Six studies were ultimately included. Women were found to have more recurrent concussions than men across all sex-comparable sports, which included soccer, basketball, and baseball/softball [RR=2.16 (95% CI: 1.09-4.30)]. More specifically, women were found to have more recurrent concussions in soccer [RR=3.01 (95% CI: 2.08-4.35)] and basketball [RR=2.68 (95% CI: 1.39-5.17)], but inconclusive results were seen for baseball/softball [RR=2.54 (95% CI: 0.54-11.94)].

PoseCoach: A Customizable Analysis and Visualization System for Video-Based Running Coaching,2022-12-20,2022,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Jingyuan Liu, Nazmus Saquib, Chen Zhutian, Rubaiat Habib Kazi, Li-Yi Wei, Hongbo Fu, Chiew-Lan Tai","Videos are an accessible form of media for analyzing sports postures and providing feedback to athletes. Existing sport-specific systems embed bespoke human pose attributes and thus can be hard to scale for new attributes, especially for users without programming experiences. Some systems retain scalability by directly showing the differences between two poses, but they might not clearly visualize the key differences that viewers would like to pursue. Besides, video-based coaching systems often present feedback on the correctness of poses by augmenting videos with visual markers or reference poses. However, previewing and augmenting videos limit the analysis and visualization of human poses due to the fixed viewpoints in videos, which confine the observation of captured human movements and cause ambiguity in the augmented feedback. To address these issues, we study customizable human pose data analysis and visualization in the context of running pose attributes, such as joint angles and step distances. Based on existing literature and a formative study, we have designed and implemented a system, PoseCoach, to provide feedback on running poses for amateurs by comparing the running poses between a novice and an expert. PoseCoach adopts a customizable data analysis model to allow users' controllability in defining pose attributes of their interests through our interface. To avoid the influence of viewpoint differences and provide intuitive feedback, PoseCoach visualizes the pose differences as part-based 3D animations on a human model to imitate the demonstration of a human coach. We conduct a user study to verify our design components and conduct expert interviews to evaluate the usefulness of the system.",1
The Effect of Q Angle on Anaerobic Peak Power and Balance in 15-17 Age Group Football Players,2022-12-18,2022,Akdeniz Spor Bilimleri Dergisi (Mediterranean Journal of Sport Science),Akdeniz Spor Bilimleri Dergisi,"Nilgün VURGUN, Şebnem ŞARVAN CENGİZ, Hüseyin KARESİ, Hayal ÖRCÜTAŞ","Quadriceps angle (QA) is a method that is frequently used in the kinesiological evaluation of the knee joint and lower extremity. In particular, strength has been shown to be important factors for basic football actions such as sprinting or changing direction, passing, jumping, kicking the ball, or stepping fast. In light of these informations, the aim of the study is to examine the effect of QA on anaerobic peak power and balance in youth football players aged 15-17. To measure individuals’ QA, a digital manual goniometer was used, half squat vertical jump test with SmartSpeed Contact Mat to measure anaerobic peak power, and Y balance test to measure balance performance were applied. It was determined that the obtained data were normally distributed, and the Pearson correlation test and simple regression tests were applied to the analysis. The analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between the subjects' QA average values and their anaerobic peak power averages. There was a moderate relationship between left QA and left anterior reach distances (R=0.436, R2 =0.190, p=.048), and a moderately significant relationship between height and right QA and left posterolateral reach distances (R=0.543, R2 =0.295, p=.043). As a result, the subjects' left anterior reach distance variable explained 19% of the total variance in the left QA, while the right QA and left posteromedial reach distance variables explained approximately 30% of the total variance in height.",1
The effects of repeated backward running training on measures of physical fitness in youth male soccer players,2022-12-17,2022,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Yassine Negra, Senda Sammoud, Aaron Uthoff, Rodrigo Ramirez-Campillo, Jason Moran, Helmi Chaabene","This study explored the effects of an 8-week repeated backward running training (RBRT) programme on measures of physical fitness in youth male soccer players. Youth male soccer players were randomly allocated into a RBRT group (n = 20; 13.95 ± 0.22y) or a control group (CG; n = 16; 14.86 ± 0.29y). The CG continued normal soccer training, while the RBRT group replaced some soccer drills with RBRT twice per week. Within-group analysis revealed that RBRT improved all performance variables (∆-9.99% to 14.50%; effect size [ES] = −1.79 to 1.29; p ≤ 0.001). Meanwhile, trivial-to-moderate detrimental effects on sprinting and change of direction (CoD) speed (∆1.55% to 10.40%; p ≤ 0.05) were noted in the CG. The number of individuals improving performance above the smallest worthwhile change ranged from 65–100% across all performance variables in the RBRT group, whereas<50% in the CG reached that threshold. The between-group analysis indicated that the RBRT group improved performance on all performance tasks more than the CG (ES = −2.23 to 1.10; p ≤ 0.05). These findings demonstrate that substituting part of a standard soccer training regimen with RBRT can enhance youth soccer players' sprinting, CoD, jumping, and RSA performance.",1

In a non-randomized design, 32 male semi-professional football players from two Spanish clubs participated in the study: one served as the control group (CG, n = 11), while the other performed the SL (n = 15). Performance and movement quality of drop vertical jump and 70º change of direction (COD70) were evaluated through 2D video footage pre- and post-intervention. In such tasks, the Landing Error Scoring System for first (LESS1) and second (LESS2) landings, and the Cutting Movement Assessment Score (CMAS) were used for assessing movement quality. Pre-to-post changes and baseline-adjusted ANCOVA were used. Medium-to-large differences between groups at post-test were shown in CMAS, LESS1 and LESS2 (p < 0.082, ղ2 = 0.137-0.272), with small-to-large improvements in SL (p < 0.046, ES=0.546-1.307), and CG remaining unchanged (p > 0.05) pre-to-post. In COD70 performance, large differences were found between groups (p < 0.047, ղ2 = 0.160-0.253), with SL maintaining performance (p > 0.05, ES=0.039-0.420), while CG moderately decreasing performance (p = 0.024, ES=0.753) pre-to-post. The SL is a feasible and effective TM program to improve movement quality and thus potential injury risk in cutting and landing, while not negatively affecting performance.",1

Data Sources A literature search of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases was conducted in November 2021. Study Selection Included studies were randomized crossover or parallel-group controlled trials in which researchers assessed ankle biomechanics during landing, running, or change of direction in participants with CAI using external ankle supports compared with no support. Data Extraction Two authors independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool version 2) and quality of evidence (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compare between-groups mean differences with 95% CIs. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation recommendations were used to determine the certainty of findings. Data Synthesis A total of 13 studies of low to moderate risk of bias were included. During landing, very low-grade evidence indicated external ankle supports reduce frontal-plane excursion (mean difference [95% CI] = −1.83° [−2.97°, −0.69°], P = .002), plantar-flexion angle at initial contact (−3.86° [−6.18°, −1.54°], P = .001), and sagittal-plane excursion (−3.45° [−5.00°, −1.90°], P &amp;lt; .001) but not inversion angle at initial contact (−1.00° [−3.59°, 1.59°], P = .45). During running, very low- to low-grade evidence indicated external ankle supports reduce sagittal-plane excursion (−5.21° [−8.59°, −1.83°], P = .003) but not inversion angle at initial contact (0.32° [−2.11°, 1.47°], P = .73), frontal-plane excursion (−1.31° [−3.24°, 0.63°], P = .19), or plantar-flexion angle at initial contact (−0.12° [−3.54°, 3.29°], P = .94). Studies investigating changes of direction were insufficient. Conclusions Very low-grade evidence indicated external ankle supports reduce frontal-plane excursion but not inversion angle at initial contact in participants with CAI during landing. Limiting frontal-plane excursion may reduce ankle-sprain risk. Frontal-plane ankle kinematics were not influenced by external ankle supports during running. Sagittal-plane reductions were observed with external ankle supports during landing and running with low to very low certainty, but their influence on ankle-sprain risk is undetermined.",1

This study investigated if stature limits match-playing time and performance in elite World Cup soccer among players, positions, and countries. We hypothesized stature would not affect match-playing time or performance. Descriptive data were collected on 552 players from 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Odds ratios determined likelihood of starting for players <165 cm and ≥165 cm. ANOVAs compared playing time between stature groups, among positions, and between countries. Performance factors including assists, goals, attempts, corners, shots blocked, and defending blocks were reported. Independent t-tests compared differences between players (≥165 cm, < 165 cm). Data are reported, mean difference [95% confidence interval] [MD (95%CI)] and effect sizes (ES). On average, 32.3% of players were <165 cm. Of total players, no differences existed in total minutes (F = 0.98, p = 0.32), matches (F = 0.27 p = 0.59), or average minutes per match (F = 0.48, p = 0.49) between stature groups, regardless of position. No differences existed in playing time between players <165 cm and ≥165 cm among any positions (p > 0.05), or between countries (p > 0.05). Taller mid-fielders exhibited greater performance in goals, assists, attempts, shots blocked, and defending blocks (MD [95%CI] ES; assists, −0.44[−0.76,−0.11]0.59, p = 0.009; goals, −0.35[−0.69,−0.01]0.44, p = 0.047); attempts, 3.14[1.38, 4.90]0.80, p = 0.001; corners, 2.04[0.12, 3.95]0.48, p = 0.037; shots blocked, 0.96[0.40, 1.51]0.75, p = 0.001; defending blocks, 0.43[0.32,0.82]0.48, p = 0.035), however, actual differences were minimal. Our findings indicate stature does not inhibit playing and performing elite women's soccer, as nearly one-third of players were <165 cm.",1

Injury prevention programs must be conducted among teams and could remove team injury costs in medical staff and rehabilitation. This review aims to conduct one prevention program for ACL injury in Indonesian soccer athletes. In Indonesia, this program needs support from all stakeholders, including the coach, chief executor manager, and the medical team. The risk factor of ACL injury is divided into external and internal factors, which have to be the main focus of the medical team to process a program. Prevention program for an ACL injury includes strengthening, agility, plyometrics, balance, and proper warm-up. Those types of exercise should be implemented in intervention among athletes, but they still need their perspectives and health condition.",1
The Short-Term Effect of Dynamic Tape versus the Low-Dye Taping Technique in Plantar Fasciitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial,2022-12-09,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Aurora Castro-Méndez, Inmaculada C. Palomo-Toucedo, Manuel Pabón-Carrasco, Mercedes Ortiz-Romero, Lourdes Mª Fernández-Seguín","Background: Plantar fasciitis is a painful disorder that affects the plantar fascia of the foot, with a multifactorial aetiology. Dorsal flexion deficiency in the ankle is a risk factor for it. The provisional use of taping is described as part of conservative treatment. Dynamic Tape® is a type of tape that, adhered to muscles, allows for potential elastic energy to accumulate and dissipate later, optimizing its function. Therefore, it can offer immediate benefits while the patient awaits definitive treatment depending on the cause. Objective: To verify the effectiveness of Dynamic Tape® and the low-dye taping technique on pain intensity, ankle range of motion, and foot posture index. Method: A randomised, double-blind clinical trial was conducted. A total of 57 subjects from the Clinical Podiatry Area of the University of Seville (Spain), clinically diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, were randomized into two groups. For one week, in the gastrocnemius–Achilles–plantar system, one group was treated with Dynamic Tape® and another group with low-dye taping. Pain, degrees of movement of dorsal flexion, and the foot posture index were measured in both groups before the intervention and one week after the intervention. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore the differences between groups. Results: Significant differences in the decrease in pain intensity using Dynamic Tape® were found when comparing the treatments (p = 0.015) and the foot posture index was more normal in low-dye taping (p &lt; 0.001). In both cases, the treatment showed similar behaviour with respect to the dorsal flexion ankle movement. Conclusion: The effectiveness of Dynamic Tape®, compared to that of the low-dye taping, has a major benefit with regard to pain intensity from fasciitis, although it does not produce changes in the ankle range of motion and foot posture index. Consequently, Dynamic Tape® can be considered a taping technique with beneficial effects on pain intensity in the provisional approach to plantar fasciitis.",1
Validity and reliability of inertial measurement units measurements for running kinematics in different foot strike pattern runners,2022-12-08,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Ziwei Zeng, Yue Liu, Pan Li, Lin Wang","This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the three-dimensional joint kinematic outcomes obtained by the inertial measurement units (IMUs) for runners with rearfoot strike pattern (RFS) and non-rearfoot strike pattern (NRFS). The IMUs system and optical motion capture system were used to simultaneous collect 3D kinematic of lower extremity joint data from participants running at 12 km/h. The joint angle waveforms showed a high correlation between the two systems after the offset correction in the sagittal plane (NRFS: coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) = 0.924-0.968, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.6°-13.7°; RFS: CMC = 0.930-0.965, RMSE = 3.1°-7.7°), but revealed high variability in the frontal and transverse planes (NRFS: CMC = 0.924-0.968, RMSE = 4.6°-13.7°; RFS: CMC = 0.930-0.965, RMSE = 3.1°-7.7°). The between-rater and between-day reliability were shown to be very good to excellent in the sagittal plane (between-rater: NRFS: CMC = 0.967-0.975, RMSE = 1.9°-2.9°, RFS: CMC = 0.922-0.989, RMSE = 1.0°-2.5°; between-day: NRFS: CMC = 0.950-0.978, RMSE = 1.6°-2.7°, RFS: CMC = 0.920-0.989, RMSE = 1.7°-2.2°), whereas the reliability was weak to very good (between-rater: NRFS: CMC = 0.480-0.947, RMSE = 1.1°-2.7°, RFS: CMC = 0.646-0.873, RMSE = 0.7°-2.4°; between-day: NRFS: CMC = 0.666-0.867, RMSE = 0.7°-2.8°, RFS: CMC = 0.321-0.805, RMSE = 0.9°-5.0°) in the frontal and transverse planes across all joints in both types of runners. The IMUs system was a feasible tool for measuring lower extremity joint kinematics in the sagittal plane during running, especially for RFS runners. However, the joint kinematics data in frontal and transverse planes derived by the IMUs system need to be used with caution.",1

However, the perception of football players about injury risk and prevention strategies is poorly documented. The present article reviewed the literature about perceptions, beliefs, attitudes and knowledge toward injury risk and prevention strategies in football players. An electronic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and APA PsychINFO until July 2022. Studies were eligible if they included the perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge about injury risk and prevention in football players from any competitive level. The risk of bias was assessed in included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist. A total of 14 studies were included. Most football players agreed that their risk of injury is high and prevention strategies are important, however they do not intend to use some of these strategies. The most frequent perceived injury risk factors were low muscle strength, lack of physical fitness, fatigue, excessive training and type and condition of surfaces. The most frequent perceived injury prevention factors were warm-up, workload monitoring and strength and conditioning training. It is essential to acknowledge perceived injury risk factors, as well as a better understanding of how coaching and medical departments' perceptions match with players' perceptions, and a modification in the perceptions of the several stakeholders at different levels of action.",1

Groenewoud, Philip J. van der Wees, J.Bart Staal","Determining readiness to return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is challenging.To develop models to predict initial (directly after rehabilitation) and sustainable (one year after rehabilitation) return to sport and performance in individuals after ACL reconstruction.We conducted a multicentre, prospective cohort study and included 208 participants. Potential predictors - demographics, pain, effusion, knee extension, muscle strength tests, jump tasks and three sport-specific questionnaires - were measured at the end of rehabilitation and 12 months post discharge from rehabilitation. Four prediction models were developed using backward logistic regression. All models were internally validated by bootstrapping.All 4 models shared 3 predictors: the participant's goal to return to their pre-injury level of sport, the participant's psychological readiness and ACL injury on the non-dominant leg. Another predictor for initial return to sport was no knee valgus, and, for sustainable return to sport, the single-leg side hop. Bootstrapping shrinkage factor was between 0.91 and 0.95, therefore the models' properties were similar before and after internal validation. The areas under the curve of the models ranged from 0.74 to 0.86. Nagelkerke's R2 varied from 0.23 to 0.43 and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test results varied from 2.7 (p = 0.95) to 8.2 (p = 0.41).Initial and sustainable return to sport and performance after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction rehabilitation can be easily predicted by the sport goal formulated by the individual, the individual's psychological readiness, and whether the affected leg is the dominant or non-dominant leg.",1
Effect of different anthropometry‐driven block settings on sprint start performance,2022-12-01,2022,Wiley,European Journal of Sport Science,"Valentina Cavedon, Neil Edward Bezodis, Marco Sandri, Silvia Golia, Carlo Zancanaro, Chiara Milanese","ABSTRACT Few studies have focused on the effect of individual anthropometrics when considering “set” position posture during the sprint start. This study aimed to measure the effect of different anthropometry‐driven block settings on kinetic and kinematic parameters and performance during the start in well‐trained and non‐trained sprinters. Front block‐starting line (FB/SL) distance was manipulated between 50% and 70% of each individual's leg length at 5% intervals, whilst the inter‐block distance was held constant at 45% of leg length. Thirty‐six sprinters performed three maximal‐effort 10 m sprints in each of the five conditions. Joint angles in the “set” position were quantified though 2D video analysis, the forces generated during block clearance phase were measured by dynamometric starting blocks, and times to 5 and 10 m were measured with photocells. The effects of the five block setting conditions were largely consistent irrespective of ability level. Shorter FB/SL distances were associated with significantly more flexed hip and knee angles in the “set” position, a significantly more plantar flexed front ankle, and a significantly more dorsiflexed rear ankle. There were no significant effects of FB/SL distance on total block time, and thus the greater rear block peak forces and impulses produced from the shorter FB/SL distances combined with no effects on the resultant front block peak forces and impulses, led to higher levels of sprint start performance from the shorter FB/SL distances. Considering FB/SL distances closer to 50% of leg length may be beneficial for coaches and athletes to explore during sprint start training.",1
Neuromuscular characteristics of agonists and antagonists during maximal eccentric knee flexion in soccer players with a history of hamstring muscle injuries,2022-12-01,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Ramona Ritzmann, Sarah Strütt, Ignacio Torreno, Janine Riesterer, Christoph Centner, Luis Suarez-Arrones","Muscle strain injuries (MSIs) in the hamstrings are among the most prevalent injuries in elite soccer. We aimed to examine the relation between biomechanical maladaptation in eccentric strength and neuromuscular factors separated by their time and frequency domains.20 elite soccer players with a previous history of unilateral MSI in the M. biceps femoris (BF) long head and 20 without MSI participated. Knee flexion torques, rate of torque development (RTD) and electromyographic signals (EMG) of the BF, the M. semitendinosus (SMT) and knee extensors were obtained during unilateral maximal eccentric knee flexions performed at slow (30°/s) and fast (120°/s) angular speeds. Root mean squares and mean power frequency (MF) was calculated.In the group with a history of MSI, reduced maximal eccentric flexion torque (slow eccentrics -8±11, p<0.05; fast eccentrics -18±13 N*m, p<0.05) and RTD (-33±28 N*m/s, p<0.05; -95±47 N*m/s, p<0.05) concomitantly occurred with diminished agonistic myoelectrical activities (-4±5% of MVC, p<0.05; -10±7% of MVC, p<0.05) and MFs (-24±13 Hz, p<0.05; -24±18 Hz, p<0.05) in the BF. Simultaneously, antagonistic myoelectric activity was elevated (+4±3% of MVC, p<0.05; +3±3% of MVC, p<0.05) in MSI affected legs as compared to unaffected legs for both eccentric contractions. Deficits in myoelectrical activity (r2 = 0.715, p<0.05; r2 = 0.601, p<0.05) and MF (r2 = 0.484, p<0.05; r2 = 0.622, p<0.05) correlated with deficits in maximal torque in the affected leg in the MSI group. Analysis of SMT demonstrated no significant differences.Positive relationships between neuromuscular deficits and the reduced eccentric strength profile underpin neuronal inhibition after MSI. This persistent involvement of dysfunctional synergist and antagonist neural hamstring function in strength weakness is of clinical relevance in sports medicine for prevention and rehabilitation.",1

It was determined that training and comprehensive training of professional football players of a new quality is possible only with the help of modern methods based on the latest advances in information technology. Thus, the introduction of modern innovative technologies into the education system, which ensure further improvement of the educational process, technical and tactical training of football students, is of great importance. It has been established that the level of playing skill in football is based on the stability and variability of technical and tactical techniques. Reforms carried out in the system of higher education deeply affected the process of physical education of student youth. The search for ways to increase its effectiveness is the object of constant attention of many researchers. In addition, the process of physical education of students has its own characteristics due to the impact on it of various external and internal factors that determine the target orientation, the selection of the content of educational material, the design of organizational, methodical and material infrastructure.

Angular Velocities and Linear Accelerations Derived from Inertial Measurement Units Can Be Used as Proxy Measures of Knee Variables Associated with ACL Injury,2022-11-29,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Holly S. R. Jones, Victoria H. Stiles, Jasper Verheul, Isabel S. Moore","Given the high rates of both primary and secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in multidirectional field sports, there is a need to develop easily accessible methods for practitioners to monitor ACL injury risk. Field-based methods to assess knee variables associated with ACL injury are of particular interest to practitioners for monitoring injury risk in applied sports settings. Knee variables or proxy measures derived from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) may thus provide a powerful tool for efficient injury risk management. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify whether there were correlations between laboratory-derived knee variables (knee range of motion (RoM), change in knee moment, and knee stiffness) and metrics derived from IMUs (angular velocities and accelerations) placed on the tibia and thigh, across a range of movements performed in practitioner assessments used to monitor ACL injury risk. Ground reaction forces, three-dimensional kinematics, and triaxial IMU data were recorded from nineteen healthy male participants performing bilateral and unilateral drop jumps, and a 90° cutting task. Spearman’s correlations were used to examine the correlations between knee variables and IMU-derived metrics. A significant strong positive correlation was observed between knee RoM and the area under the tibia angular velocity curve in all movements. Significant strong correlations were also observed in the unilateral drop jump between knee RoM, change in knee moment, and knee stiffness, and the area under the tibia acceleration curve (rs = 0.776, rs = −0.712, and rs = −0.765, respectively). A significant moderate correlation was observed between both knee RoM and knee stiffness, and the area under the thigh angular velocity curve (rs = 0.682 and rs = −0.641, respectively). The findings from this study suggest that it may be feasible to use IMU-derived angular velocities and acceleration measurements as proxy measures of knee variables in movements included in practitioner assessments used to monitor ACL injury risk.",1

The impact of foot orthoses during exercises that recreate a non-contact ACL harm system (i.e., landing) in any case will be obscured. Objectives: The purpose of the current study research was to evaluate the effect of two foot orthoses (semi-hard foot orthoses and hard foot orthoses) on knee valgus angle during single-leg drop landing. Methods: Twenty male leisure volleyball gamers performed landing in one-leg step from 30 cm height in 3 conditions (without foot orthoses, mid-hard foot orthoses, and hard foot orthoses). A motion capture system was used to measure lower extremity kinematics. Two risk factors of ACL injury, maximum knee valgus angle (KVA), and maximum knee flexion was measured. ANOVA was used for statistical analysis (P &lt; 0.05). Results: With mid-hard foot, orthoses provide the maximum level of knee flexion and the minimum level of knee valgus during single-leg drop landing. Conclusions: It may be concluded showed that foot orthoses affect knee kinematics. More knee flexion and less knee valgus brought about by mid-hard foot orthoses can reduce injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).",1

Two video cameras and a tens platform were used. The researched persons have been performing two test movements landing on the tens-platform from a standardized height of 35 centimeters and a jump and landing on the tens-platform. The analysis was effectuated by joining a software program for kinematic analysis “KINOVEA” and the dynamometric one by a specialized computer dynamometric system by a measuring platform. At the moment of maximum exertion, the angle between the thigh and the shank was measured. The distance between the knees at the moment of amortization was shot by means of the video camera placed in front. The juxtaposition of the change of the distances between the knee joints with the initial values shows a medialization in all researched persons. This is an indication of a deficit in the muscle control of the lower limbs. The coefficient of variation and the range demonstrate the presence of significant differences in the distance between the knee joints in different persons. The values in both tests prove to be rather close landing from a standardized height and a jump from a platform. In the angle of flexion at the moment of the maximum foothold reaction upon landing from a standardized height there are no big differences in the studied persons. In the jump from a platform the maximum values of the flexion are greater and the range of the values as well. This indicated to a greater individual dependency of the amortization phase of the landing on the very jump.",1

Three different injury mechanisms were seen: mixed-type (both sprint-related and stretch-related, 43%), stretch-type (36%), and sprint-type (21%). Most common actions during injury moments were change of direction (29%), kicking (29%), and running (21%). Most injuries occurred at high or very high horizontal speed (71%) and affected isolated proximal biceps femoris (BF) (36%). Most frequent body positions at defined injury moments were neutral trunk (43%), hip flexion 45-90 degrees (57%), and knee flexion <45 degrees (93%). Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed that 79% were isolated single-tendon injuries.According to a video analysis, most hamstring injuries in soccer occur during high-speed movements. Physicians should suspect proximal and isolated single-tendon-most often BF-hamstring injury, if represented injury mechanisms are seen during game play. In addition to sprinting and stretching, also mixed-type injury mechanisms occur.",1
Effect of combining eight weeks of neuromuscular training with dual cognitive tasks on landing mechanics in futsal players with knee ligament dominance defect: a randomized controlled trial,2022-11-22,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Majid Hamoongard, Malihe Hadadnezhad, Ali Abbasi","The performing of jump and landing in futsal simultaneous with divided attention is one of the most common mechanisms of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Neuromuscular training has effectively reduced the risk of ACL injury, but the effect of neurocognitive training has received less attention. This study investigated the effect of combining 8 weeks of neuromuscular training with dual cognitive tasks on the landing mechanics of futsal players with knee ligament dominance defects.Thirty male futsal players (mean ± SD: age: 21.86 ± 3.27 years) with knee ligament dominance defects were purposefully identified by the tuck jump test and were randomly divided into the intervention and the control group. The intervention group performed dual task (DT) training for three weekly sessions for 8 weeks and 60 min each, while the control group only did activities of daily living. During the drop vertical jump test, 2D landing kinematics in two moments of initial contact (IC) and full flexion (FF) were assessed. Data were analyzed by means of 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison (Bonferroni) at the significance level of (α ≤ 0.05).A significant improvement was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group for the dynamic knee valgus at IC (F1,28 = 6.33; P = 0.02, ES = 0.31) and FF (F1,28 = 13.47; P = 0.003, ES = 0.49), knee flexion at IC (F1,28 = 20.08; P = 0.001, ES = 0.41) and FF (F1,28 = 13.67; P = 0.001, ES = 0.32), ankle dorsiflexion at IC (F1,28 = 37.17; P = 0.001, ES = 0.72) and FF (F1,28 = 14.52; P = 0.002, ES = 0.50), and trunk flexion at FF (F1,28 = 20.48; P = 0.001, ES = 0.59) angles. Changes in the trunk flexion at IC (F1,28 = 0.54; P = 0.47, ES = 0.03) and trunk lateral flexion at IC (F1,28 = 0.006; P = 0.93, ES = 0.00) and FF (F1,28 = 2.44; P = 0.141, ES = 0.148) angles were not statistically significant.DT training compared to the control group improved landing mechanics in futsal players with knee ligament dominance defects.Current Controlled Trials using the IRCT website with ID number IRCT20210602051477N1 prospectively registered on 20/06/2021.",1
Biomechanical fidelity of athletic training using virtual reality head-mounted display: the case of preplanned and unplanned sidestepping,2022-11-22,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Man Kit Lei, Kuangyou B. Cheng","Virtual reality has recently been recognised as an effective tool for investigating visual-perceptual tasks. To develop a sport-specific virtual environment with realistic locomotion, it is crucial to examine the effect of using virtual reality devices on athletes performing intense and complex movements. Twelve collegiate football players were instructed to perform pre-planned and unplanned sidestepping in both environments with the same dimension and experimental setup in the virtual environment as in the real one. Analysis of the performance and knee biomechanical parameters showed that movements performed in the two environments were generally comparable. Consistent changes in approach velocity and knee angle/moment under unplanned conditions (compared with preplanned conditions) were also found in the virtual environment as in the real one, except for the significantly larger peak flexion angle (p < .05) observed in the virtual environment. Interestingly, half of the participants changed from producing abduction to adduction moment at the weight acceptance phase in the preplanned condition (p < .05). These findings suggested that while it is generally feasible to use virtual reality head-mounted displays for designated experiments and training, the effect of wearing virtual reality devices could be somewhat subject-specific.",1

Rehabilitation following surgical reconstruction for anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency: What has changed since the 1960s?—State of the art,2022-11-19,2022,Elsevier BV,Journal of ISAKOS,"Sergio R. Piedade, Bruno P. Leite Arruda, Rodrigo A. de Vasconcelos, David A. Parker, Nicola Maffulli","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency can be disabling, given the physical and sports activity constraints that negatively impact the quality of life. Consequently, surgery is the main approach for most active patients. Nonetheless, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) cannot be successful without adequate preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation. Since the 1960s, post-ACLR rehabilitation has evolved, mainly from advances in surgery, coupled with a better understanding of the biological concepts of graft revascularization, maturation and integration, which have impacted ACL postoperative rehabilitation protocols. However, new technologies do involve a definite learning curve which could affect rehabilitation programs and produce inconsistent results. The development of rehabilitation protocols cannot be defined without an accurate diagnosis of ACL injury and considering the patient's main physical demands and expectations. This article discusses how postoperative rehabilitation following ACLR has changed from the 1960s to now, focussing on surgical technique (type of tendon graft, fixation devices, and graft tensioning), biological concepts (graft maturation and integration), rehabilitation protocols (prevention of ACL injuries, preoperative rehabilitation, postoperative rehabilitation), criteria to return to sports, patient's reported outcomes and outcome. Although rehabilitation plays an essential role in managing ACL injuries, it cannot be fully standardised preoperatively or postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation should be based on an accurate clinical diagnosis, patients' understanding of their injury, graft tissue biology and biomechanics, surgical technique, the patient's physical demands and expectations, geographical differences in ACL rehabilitation and future perspectives.",1
Could hand-eye laterality profiles affect sport performance? A systematic review,2022-11-17,2022,PeerJ,PeerJ,"Miquel Moreno, Lluis Capdevila, Josep-Maria Losilla","Background Laterality effects on sports performance have been a field of interest for the sports sciences, especially in asymmetrical sports, which require the preferential use of one side of the body. Some sports in particular involve the visual system and ocular laterality, due to the need to clearly focus on a dynamic object (ball, opponent, projectile, etc. ). The relationship between manual and ocular laterality results in two perceptual-motor profiles, one where the dominant hand and eye are ipsilateral (uncrossed hand-eye laterality profile, UC-HELP), and the other where they are contralateral (crossed hand-eye laterality profile, C-HELP). Methodology A systematic review of the literature was carried out to determine the prevalence of hand-eye laterality profiles in the different sports modalities and their relationship with psychological factors and sports performance. Searches of PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus and grey literature identified 14 studies (2,759 participants) regarding hand-eye laterality in sports that met the eligibility criteria. Results Previous studies have estimated that between 10–30% of the general population exhibit a C-HELP, and 70–90% have an UC-HELP. The results of the reviewed studies indicate that in some sports the percentage of C-HELP is higher in regular and high-level athletes than in the normal population: golf (52.55%), soccer (53%), tennis (42%) and team sports (50.7%). In target sports (archery and shooting) athletes with an UC-HELP seem to have an advantage given the significant concentration of this profile in the highest performing populations (82.3%). In basketball, cricket and golf, the literature reviewed also reported biomechanical differences in the execution of some techniques between the two profiles. We did not find any study in our review that related hand-eye laterality with cognitive, tactical, or psychological aspects of athletes. Conclusions These results should be taken with great caution due to the potential bias linked to the methodologies used in the investigations, the heterogeneity in the assessment of hand-eye laterality, the few studies available on the subject and the indirect nature of many of the observed relationships between performance and laterality. For further investigation, we propose a standardized terminology and protocol of hand-eye laterality assessment in sports. The advancement in knowledge about hand-eye laterality profiles, along with the study of the relationship with psychological or tactical-sports patterns, can contribute to more effective development plans for athletes and can be a complement to talent detection.",1
"Evaluation of Neuromuscular Fatigue in a Repeat Sprint Ability, Countermovement Jump and Hamstring Test in Elite Female Soccer Players",2022-11-16,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Estrella Armada-Cortés, José A. Benítez-Muñoz, Alejandro F. San Juan, Javier Sánchez-Sánchez","The straight-line run is the most frequent action in soccer goal scoring situations, and it deserves considerable attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the neuromuscular fatigue produced by an independent repeat sprint ability (RSA) test, a countermovement jump (CMJ) and a hamstring test (HT) in elite female soccer players. Twenty-four elite female soccer players participated in the study. The evaluation protocol included hamstring and CMJ tests before an RSA test (6 × 40 m 30 s rest), and hamstring and CMJ post-tests. Significant differences were found between pre–post HT measurements in the maximum angulation of the right leg (p = 0.012 Effect Size (ES) = 0.27), and the maximum velocity was higher in the left leg after RSA (p = 0.023 ES = 0.34). CMJ height after RSA was significantly lower than before the RSA test (p &lt; 0.001 ES = 0.40). The sprint total time (SprintTT) and percentage difference (%Dif) increased throughout the RSA (p &lt; 0.001, and ES = 0.648 and ES = 0.515, respectively). In elite female soccer players, it seems that the fatigue induced by an RSA test can be assessed through the loss of CMJ height and the different performance variables extracted from the RSA itself (e.g., SprintTT, Ideal Sprint). These findings could contribute to better performance management and injury prevention for elite female soccer players.",1
Alternate Leg Bounding Acutely Improves Change of Direction Performance in Women's Team Sports Players Irrespective of Ground Type,2022-11-15,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research,"Eleanor Dann, Samuel Quinn, Mark Russell, Liam P. Kilduff, Anthony N. Turner, Samuel P. Hills","Dann, E, Quinn, S, Russell, M, Kilduff, LP, Turner, AN, and Hills, SP. Alternate leg bounding acutely improves change-of-direction performance in women's team sports players irrespective of ground type. J Strength Cond Res 37(6): 1199-1203, 2023-This study aimed to assess whether body mass only alternate leg bounding performed post-warm-up on grass or a hard surface acutely improves preplanned change-of-direction performance in women's team sports players relative to a control condition and, if so, profile the time course of such changes. On 3 occasions, 14 amateur women's team sports players performed 20 m preplanned change-of-direction (""Pro-Agility"") tests at 4, 8, and 12 minutes after interventions. Interventions were implemented immediately after a standardized warm-up and consisted of 3 sets of 10 repetitions of alternate leg bounding (5 ground contacts per limb) on a hard indoor surface (HARD) or natural grass (GRASS), or a control condition involving approximately 75 seconds of continuous walking with no bounding (CON). Performance was similar between conditions at 4-minutes postintervention. Performance at 8 minutes was greater in HARD (2.9%, p = 0.015) and GRASS (3.8%, p = 0.029) relative to CON, whereas GRASS also exceeded CON at 12 minute post-bounding (5.2%, p = 0.004). All effects were large. No differences existed between HARD and GRASS at any time. Irrespective of the ground surface, alternate leg bounding performed with body mass only can acutely improve indices of change-of-direction performance in women's team sports players when an appropriate post-stimulus recovery period is provided. Bounding on grass or a hard surface represents a feasible match-day practice that enhances subsequent change-of-direction performance and could therefore be used as part of practically applicable pre-match, half-time, and pitch-side (re)warm-up activities.",1
High Sport Specialization Is Associated With More Musculoskeletal Injuries in Canadian High School Students,2022-11-11,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Chris Whatman, Carla van den Berg, Amanda M. Black, Stephen West, Brent Hagel, Paul Eliason, Carolyn Emery","Objective: To describe levels of sport specialization in Canadian high school students and investigate whether sport specialization and/or sport participation volume is associated with the history of musculoskeletal injury and/or concussion. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: High schools, Alberta, Canada. Participants: High school students (14-19 years) participating in various sports. Independent Variables: Level of sport specialization (high, moderate, low) and sport participation volume (hours per week and months per year). Main Outcome Measures: Twelve-month injury history (musculoskeletal and concussion). Results: Of the 1504 students who completed the survey, 31% were categorized as highly specialized (7.5% before the age of 12 years). Using multivariable, negative, binomial regression (adjusted for sex, age, total yearly training hours, and clustering by school), highly specialized students had a significantly higher musculoskeletal injury rate [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.73] but not lower extremity injury or concussion rate, compared with low specialization students. Participating in one sport for more than 8 months of the year significantly increased the musculoskeletal injury rate (IRR = 1.27, 95% CI, 1.02-1.58). Increased training hours significantly increased the musculoskeletal injury rate (IRR = 1.18, 95% CI, 1.13-1.25), lower extremity injury rate (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI, 1.09-1.24), and concussion rate (IRR = 1.31, 95% CI, 1.24-1.39). Conclusions: Approximately one-third of Canadian high school students playing sports were categorized as highly specialized. The musculoskeletal injury rate was higher for high sport specialization students compared with low sport specialization students. Musculoskeletal injuries and concussion were also more common in students who train more and spend greater than 8 months per year in one sport.",1
"Despite Good Correlations, There Is No Exact Coincidence between Isometric and Dynamic Strength Measurements in Elite Youth Soccer Players",2022-11-10,2022,MDPI AG,Sports,"Carl-M. Wagner, Konstantin Warneke, Christoph Bächer, Christian Liefke, Philipp Paintner, Larissa Kuhn, Torsten Brauner, Klaus Wirth, Michael Keiner","Speed strength performances are substantially dependent on maximum strength. Due to their importance, various methods have been utilized to measure maximum strength (e.g., isometric or dynamic) with discussed differences regarding transferability to sport-specific movements dependent upon the testing procedure. The aim of this study was to analyze whether maximum isometric force (MIF) during isometric back squats correlates with maximum strength measurements of the one repetition maximum (1RM) in the squat, with countermovement jump (CMJ) performance, and with drop jump (DJ) performances in elite youth soccer players (n = 16, 18.4 ± 1.5 [range: 17-23] years old). Additionally, concordance correlation coefficients (CCC, [ρc]) between isometric and dynamic measurements were calculated to verify whether one measurement can actually reproduce the results of the other. To improve comprehension, differences between isometric and dynamic testing values were illustrated by providing differences between both testing conditions. For this, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were calculated. To reach equality in scale, the 1RM measures were multiplicated by 9.81 to obtain a value of N. The 1RM demonstrated correlations of τ = |0.38| to |0.52| with SJ and CMJ performances, while MIF demonstrated correlations of τ = |0.21| to |0.32|. However, the correlations of both 1RM and MIF with the DJ reactive strength index (RSI = jump height /contact time) from different falling heights were of no statistical significance. The data showed significant correlations between both the absolute (τ = |0.54|) and the relative (τ = |0.40|) performances of 1RM and MIF, which were confirmed by CCC of ρc= |0.56| to |0.66|, respectively. Furthermore, the MAE and MAPE showed values of 2080.87 N and 67.4%, respectively. The data in this study show that, despite good correlations, there is no exact coincidence between isometric and dynamic strength measurements. Accordingly, both measurements may only represent an estimation of maximal strength capacity and cannot be substituted for each other. Therefore, maximal strength should be tested by using high similarity in the contraction condition, as it is used in the training process to counteract underestimation in strength because of unfamiliarity with the testing condition.",1

This study aimed to investigate the differences in anaerobic power output, dynamic stability, lower limb strength, and power among elite soccer players based on their field position. A cross-sectional population of 96 elite soccer players with average age 23.10 ± 4.35 years, weight 69.99 ± 9.71 kg, height 174.84 ± 6.64 cm, and body mass index 22.84 ± 2.39 kg/m2 from various soccer clubs in Saudi Arabia was tested for their anaerobic power output, dynamic stability, lower limb strength, and power performance. All the participants have more than 4 years of experience in competitive soccer events. Tests included a measure of single-leg vertical jump, star excursion balance test, and single-leg triple hop test for distance. The players were divided into four groups (goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and attackers) based on their self-reported position on the field. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between all variables according to the players’ position. In addition, partial eta-squared (ηp2) was used to report effect sizes. The results revealed significant differences between positions in the anaerobic power output (p = 0.012, ηp2 = 0.312), dynamic stability {Anterior (p = 0.004, ηp2 = 0.235), Anteromedial (p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.622), Anterolateral (p = 0.011, ηp2 = 0.114)}, and lower limb strength, and power (p = 0.008, ηp2 = 0.421). At the same time, goalkeepers’ performance was significantly superior to midfielders (p = 0.006) in the anaerobic power output. In addition, lower limb strength and power was significantly higher (p = 0.004) for goalkeepers than for midfielders, with a similar trend in dynamic stability (p = 0.007). These results exhibited differences in anaerobic power output, dynamic stability, lower limb strength, and power performance based on the players’ positions. The investigation may assist the practitioner in designing training programs for the players according to their position for performance improvement.",1
Effects of Fatigue Induced by Repeated Sprints on Sprint Biomechanics in Football Players: Should We Look at the Group or the Individual?,2022-11-08,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Valentin Romero, Johan Lahti, Adrián Castaño Zambudio, Jurdan Mendiguchia, Pedro Jiménez Reyes, Jean-Benoît Morin","The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of fatigue on sprint biomechanics. Fifty-one football players performed twelve maximal 30 m sprints with 20 s recovery between each sprint. Sprint kinetics were computed from running speed data and a high-frequency camera (240 Hz) was used to study kinematic data. A cluster analysis (K-mean clustering) was conducted to classify individual kinematic adaptations. A large decrease in maximal power output and less efficiency in horizontally orienting the ground reaction force were observed in fatigued participants. In addition, individual changes in kinematic components were observed, and, according to the cluster analysis, five clusters were identified. Changes in trunk, knee, and hip angles led to an overall theoretical increase in hamstring strain for some players (Cluster 5, 20/51) but to an overall decrease for some others (Cluster 1, 11/51). This study showed that the repeated sprint ability (RSA) protocol had an impact on both kinetics and kinematics. Moreover, fatigue affected the kinematics in a different way for each player, and these individual changes were associated with either higher or lower hamstring length and thus strain.",1
Futsal playing surface characteristics significantly affect perceived traction and change of direction performance among experienced futsal players,2022-11-07,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Shariman Ismadi Ismail, Hiroyuki Nunome, Filip Gertz Lysdal, Uwe Gustav Kersting, Yuji Tamura","We aimed to clarify the effect of different futsal playing surface structural properties on the resultant change of direction (COD) performance, perceived traction and frictional properties. Twenty experienced male university soccer players performed a COD slalom-course test and perceived traction evaluation on three different types of playing surfaces (area-elastic: AE, point-elastic no.1: PE1 and point-elastic no.2: PE2). Frictional properties of these surfaces were mechanically evaluated against a futsal shoe, using a hydraulic moving force platform, and expressed as available friction coefficient (AFC). In the COD performance test, the participants performed significantly better on the point-elastic surfaces (PE1 and PE2) when compared to the area-elastic surface (AE) (p < 0.05). Also, the PE2 surface was found to have the highest perceived traction (p < 0.001). The findings suggest that the relatively higher (4%) AFC explains the improvement in performance and traction perception on the PE2 surface. In this study, we successfully demonstrated that the structural difference (AE or PE) of futsal playing surface has a significant impact on the COD performance of experienced futsal players and their perceived level of traction (PE2) and the frictional properties.",1

Plantar Fasciitis in Soccer Players—A Systemic Review,2022-11-03,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"David C. Noriega, Ángel Cristo, Alejandro León, Belén García-Medrano, Alberto Caballero-García, Alfredo Córdova-Martinez","Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. Players often suffer a variety of injuries, the most common being injuries to muscles and tendons. It is striking that with soccer, being the most practiced sport, and considering that most injuries occur in the lower extremities, plantar fasciitis (PF) is not one of the most frequent injuries (at least in terms of clinical data collected). The purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive update of the topic ""plantar fasciitis"" focusing on soccer players. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reportiog ltems for Systmiatic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. PubMed, Cochrane Library and Scopus were researched. PICO (Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; and Outcome) components were identified. The keywords used were ""plantar fasciitis"", ""plantar fasciitis and sport"", ""plantar fasciitis risk factors"", ""plantar fasciitis soccer"" and ""plantar fasciitis football players"". With respect to the objective proposed for the research, we found eight specific articles focused on soccer. Of these, five were general reviews discussing the different methods of treatment of this pathology, and we have only found three studies that focused on PF in soccer, with two of them referring to a clinical case whereby the report and discussion only dealt with the specific treatment followed by the soccer player. After reviewing the manuscripts included in this work, we were surprised that there is no data in which the Silfverskiöld test was performed, as this test explores the passive mobility of the ankle and the degree of dorsiflexion in the supine position. We concluded that soccer players suffer pain in the sole of the foot compatible with plantar fasciitis; however, as indicated by Suzue et al., it is often not diagnosed because the athlete does not consider performing the clinical examinations necessary for its diagnosis. The shortage of reported publications in soccer may mask other PF-associated injuries.",1
Repeatability of a piezoelectric force platform to measure impact metrics for a single model of football,2022-11-03,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"Katie L. Mills, Johsan Billingham, Simon Choppin, Marcus Dunn, Terry Senior, Simon Goodwill","Abstract The visco-elastic properties of a football influence how it bounces and therefore its performance in a game. Previously, high-speed camera footage has been used to quantify deformation, coefficient of restitution and contact time for an impact between a football and a rigid surface but these systems do not provide any information on the forces acting on the football during the impact. The aim of this study was to determine the repeatability of measuring the peak impact force, impulse, rise time and loading rate for four samples of the same model of football using a commercial force platform (Kistler 9281EA). A football impacted the floor-mounted piezoelectric-type force platform at 6.04 and 19.4 m s −1 . High absolute (coefficient of variation (CV) ≤ 10%) and relative (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ≥ 0.94) repeatability was observed for repeated impacts at both velocities. The minimal detectable differences were calculated to evaluate the ability for the force platform to be used to make meaningful comparisons between footballs. For all metrics, the minimum detectable difference accounted for less than 5% of the mean value. Therefore, it can be concluded that provided the difference in impact metrics between football models exceeds the minimal detectable difference, the commercial force platform can be used to measure and detect differences in physical impact metrics between models of footballs.",1

The purpose of the present study was to analyze how the change in the rule and the lower limbs laterality influences on the diving save kinematic performance in penalties. Six goalkeepers, two professionals and four amateurs, performed a total of 20 dives in the laboratory and had their force and impulse exerted by the lower limb and displacement/velocity data from the center of body mass collected through force plates and kinematic analysis. The side preference was collected through an inventory. The results showed that goalkeepers dive further (p &lt; 0.001) and faster (p &lt; 0.001) when diving according to the new rule. Dives for the non-dominant side presented higher values than the trials for the dominant side in mediolateral (p = 0.02) and resultant (p = 0.03) displacements. Concluding, the goalkeepers performed better with the new rule in the analyzed variables and the lower limb preference has influenced only the mediolateral and resultant displacement.",1
"RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISOKINETIC STRENGTH, VERTICAL JUMP, SPRINT SPEED, AGILITY AND YO-YO INTERMITTENT RECOVERY TEST PERFORMANCE IN SOCCER PLAYERS",2022-11-02,2022,Open Access Publishing Group,European Journal of Physical Education and Sport Science,"Ali Onur Cerrah, İsmail Bayram","The current study investigated the relationship between isokinetic knee strength, jump performance, agility, linear and repeated sprinting capacity and Yo-Yo IR1 test performance and the fatigue indices of some of these variables in semi-professional soccer players. Twenty semi-professional soccer players participated in this study, performing 6 tests: bilateral concentric isokinetic strength tests of the knee extensors and flexors (60◦.s-1 and 300◦.s-1), jump tests (countermovement, squat and repeated jumping), linear sprints (10 and 30 m), agility (Illinois test), Bangsbo repeated sprints (7 x 34.2 m), and Yo-Yo IR1 tests. While no isokinetic variables were significantly correlated with field test results, some jump test results correlated with AgiWB, 10- and 30-m sprint times, RSTMEAN and FIRS. Furthermore, the knee isokinetic strength (60◦.s-1 and 300◦.s-1) indices and jump capacities demonstrated moderate to strong relationships with each other. In addition, AgiWB correlated with the 10-m sprint times and RSTMEAN, 30-m linear sprint times correlated with 10-m sprint times and AgiWB, and FIRS and RSTMEAN correlated with the Yo-Yo IR1 test results. The results suggest that power output during CMJ and RJ tests and not isokinetic knee strength are informative in determining field conditioning parameters for semi-professional soccer players.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=""/-counters-/edu_01/0587/a.php"" alt=""Hit counter"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",1
Ubiquitous Computing in Sports and Physical Activity—Recent Trends and Developments,2022-11-01,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Arnold Baca, Peter Dabnichki, Che-Wei Hu, Philipp Kornfeind, Juliana Exel","The use of small, interconnected and intelligent tools within the broad framework of pervasive computing for analysis and assessments in sport and physical activity is not a trend in itself but defines a way for information to be handled, processed and utilised: everywhere, at any time. The demand for objective data to support decision making prompted the adoption of wearables that evolve to fulfil the aims of assessing athletes and practitioners as closely as possible with their performance environments. In the present paper, we mention and discuss the advancements in ubiquitous computing in sports and physical activity in the past 5 years. Thus, recent developments in wearable sensors, cloud computing and artificial intelligence tools have been the pillars for a major change in the ways sport-related analyses are performed. The focus of our analysis is wearable technology, computer vision solutions for markerless tracking and their major contribution to the process of acquiring more representative data from uninhibited actions in realistic ecological conditions. We selected relevant literature on the applications of such approaches in various areas of sports and physical activity while outlining some limitations of the present-day data acquisition and data processing practices and the resulting sensors’ functionalities, as well as the limitations to the data-driven informed decision making in the current technological and scientific framework. Finally, we hypothesise that a continuous merger of measurement, processing and analysis will lead to the development of more reliable models utilising the advantages of open computing and unrestricted data access and allow for the development of personalised-medicine-type approaches to sport training and performance.",1
Gender Comparisons and Associations between Lower Limb Muscle Activation Strategies and Resultant Knee Biomechanics during Single Leg Drop Landings,2022-11-01,2022,MDPI AG,Biomechanics,"Xiaohan Xu, Guojiong Hu, Genevieve K. R. Williams, Fenghao Ma","(1) Background: We aimed to compare gender differences in knee biomechanics and neuromuscular characteristics, and to determine the relationships between lower limb muscle pre-activations and knee biomechanics during a single leg drop landing, in order to identify riskier landing patterns to prevent injury and intervene properly. (2) Methods: Descriptive laboratory cross-sectional study on 38 healthy untrained subjects with low to moderate physical activity status. (3) Results: During the initial-contact phase of landing, females demonstrated greater peak vertical ground reaction force (GRF) normalized to body weight (49.12 ± 7.53 vs. 39.88 ± 5.69 N/kg; p &lt; 0.001; Hedge’s g = 1.37), peak knee anterior reaction force normalized to body weight (0.23 ± 0.04 vs. 0.17 ± 0.05 N/kg; p &lt; 0.001; Hedge’s g = 1.33), and decreased pre-activation of the semitendinosus (45.10 ± 20.05% vs. 34.03 ± 12.05%; p = 0.04; Hedge’s g = 0.67). The final regression equation was peak knee anterior reaction force = 0.024 + 0.025 (peak knee flexion moment) − 0.02 (semitendinosus-to-vastus lateralis pre-activation ratio) + 0.003 (peak vertical GRF) (R2 = 0.576, p &lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusions: Overall, the data provided in this study support that a reduced semitendinosus-to-vastus lateralis pre-activation ratio predicted an increase in knee anterior reaction force and potentially an increase in ACL forces. Female non-athletes had gender-specific landing characteristics that may contribute to ACL injury. Future studies are warranted to consider more possible predictors of non-contact ACL injury.",1

This contact sport carries the risk of exposure to repeated head impacts in the form of subconcussions, defined as minimal brain injuries following head impact, with no symptom of concussion. While it has been suggested that exposure to repetitive subconcussive events can result in long-term neurophysiological modifications, and the later development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the consequences of these repeated impacts remain controversial and largely unexplored in the context of soccer players. This is a prospective, single-centre, exposure/non-exposure, transverse study assessing the MRI and neuropsychological abnormalities in professional retired soccer players exposed to subconcussive impacts, compared with high-level athletes not exposed to head impacts. The primary outcome corresponds to the results of MRI by advanced MRI techniques (diffusion tensor, cerebral perfusion, functional MRI, cerebral volumetry and cortical thickness, spectroscopy, susceptibility imaging). Secondary outcomes are the results of the neuropsychological tests: number of errors and time to complete tests. We hypothesise that repeated subconcussive impacts could lead to morphological lesions and impact on soccer players' cognitive skills in the long term. Ethics approval has been obtained and the study was approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP) No 2021-A01169-32.

There were two objectives, scientifically to measure the impact of integrated muscle strengthening on young players, and practically to present an educational tool for coaches and students to understand this concept of training. To carry on this research, we proceeded to a development of the 8-week program applied to a sample of 24 well-trained players of the first division under 18 years. The hypotheses put forward, were confirmed through the educational intervention and the results obtained were significant. Our results have increased the importance of strength training integrated into the training of young footballers. The margin progress of the experimental group was significant compared to the control group, and the impact of this concept proved to be positive in the approach to the physical preparation of young footballers. It is recommended to pay attention to the concept of integrated muscle building, with all its technical components.",1

Methodology: A cross sectional study was consisting of 60 tribal male subjects namely married soccer players (n = 30) and unmarried soccer players (n = 30) selected from football coaching camp of Bankura and Purulia District of West Bengal, India. The age of the subjects were ranging from 21 to 27 years. Further, descriptive statistics, and‘t’ test applied to assess and compare the stress and motor fitness variables between the selected group of subjects. Result: Statistically, there was significant difference found on stress (‘t’= 27.34) between married and unmarried soccer players. Whereas, there was no significant difference found between married and unmarried soccer players on their motor fitness variables i.e. Explosive leg strength (‘t’ = 14.89), Shoulder muscle strength (‘t’= 1.26), Agility (‘t’ = 22.43) respectively. Conclusion: Findings established of the present study, it was concluded that Married and Unmarried both soccer players were involved in same type of activity in training session. Poor families’ subjects are not given proper free space for their personal bringing like family support to play the game and nutritional needs. For these causes the stress level was more than Unmarried soccer players.",1
Injury-Inciting Activities in Male and Female Football Players: A Systematic Review,2022-10-31,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Francesco Aiello, Franco M. Impellizzeri, Susan J. Brown, Andreas Serner, Alan McCall","A comprehensive examination of the sport-specific activities performed around the time of injury is important to hypothesise injury mechanisms, develop prevention strategies, improve management, and inform future investigations. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the current literature describing the activities performed around the time of injury in football (soccer).A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and OpenGrey. Studies were included if participants were football players aged > 13 years old and the activities performed at the time of injury were reported together with the total number of injuries. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of checklists developed for prevalence studies. The activities reported by the studies were grouped to account for inconsistent reporting, and the proportion of each injury activity was calculated. Data were not meta-analysed due to high heterogeneity of methods and classification criteria.We included 64 studies reporting on 56,740 injuries in total. ACL injures were analysed by 12 studies, ankle/foot and knee injuries were analysed by five studies, thigh injuries were analysed by four studies, hip/groin injuries were analysed by three studies, and hamstring injuries were analysed by two studies. Five studies analysed more than one type of injury and 38 studies did not specify the type of injuries analysed. Running and kicking were the predominant activities leading to thigh and hamstring injuries. Changing direction and kicking were the predominant activities leading to hip and groin injuries and duels were the predominant activities leading to ankle injuries. Duels and pressing seem the predominant activities leading to ACL injuries, while results for other knee and general injuries were inconsistent.A qualitative summary of the activities performed at the time of injury has been reported. The results need to be interpreted carefully due to the risk of bias observed in the included studies. If we are to meaningfully progress our knowledge in this area, it is paramount that future research uses consistent methods to record and classify injuries and activities leading up to and performed at the time of injury.The protocol of this systematic review was registered at the Open Science Framework ( https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/U96KV ).",1

This involves the use of strategies such as anticipatory posture adjustments and compensatory adjustments. Technology makes analysis and assessments in sports cheaper, while being valid and reliable compared to the gold-standard assessment equipment. Objectives: This article aimed to test the validity and reliability of signals extracted from the sensor’s accelerometer (Metamotion C), by comparing it to the data obtained from the gold-standard equipment (a three-dimensional video-motion-capture system). Design: Observational, cross-sectional study. Methods: We exposed 20 healthy young standing people to the pendulum impact paradigm, which consisted of predictable anteroposterior disturbances applied at the shoulder level. In order to measure this, we observed the acceleration of the center of mass in the anticipatory and compensatory phase of the disturbance and compared the signals of the two devices (Metamotion C and a motion-capture system). Results: The validation results showed the significant linear correlation of all variables with a moderate to large correlation of r ≥ 0.5 between the devices. In contrast, the reliability results between sessions obtained by filming were all significant and above 0.75, indicating excellent reliability. The APAonset variable had a reasonable to high intra-class correlation in the anticipatory phase. In the compensatory phase, the CPAtime variable showed an excellent correlation. Conclusions: Metamotion C proved reasonably valid and highly reliable in measuring the center of mass acceleration compared to the camera system in both the anticipatory and compensatory phases.",1
Time passes – healthy habits stay?,2022-10-28,2022,Science and Research Centre Koper,Annales Kinesiologiae,"Saša Pišot, Rado Pišot, Boštjan Šimunič","Introduction: Because healthy behaviors learned early in life are more likely to be maintained during adulthood, we aimed to investigate longitudinal changes of participants that were regularly involved in extracurricular sport activities (athletes; N = 7; 4 boys) and those that were not (non-athletes, N = 6; 3 boys) Methods: Participants of both groups were invited for re-assessment at the age of 27, in 2019, 12 years after they participated in a 5-year longitudinal study as adolescents (9–14 years of age, in the period 2001‒07). We investigated vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris (BF) contractile properties (tensiomyography), maximal running speed (photocells), anthropometric measures (bioimpedance), maximal vertical jumping height (squat and countermovement jumps on a ground reaction force plate), and lifestyle characteristics (GPAQ and EHIS surveys). Results: Based on Cohen’s d effect size we found that athletes have lower body mass index, higher maximal running speed, better maximal vertical jumping height, and shorter BF contraction time, not found in VL, compared to non-athletes. Furthermore, athletes also exhibit healthier lifestyle characteristics such as lower sedentary time and higher daily energy expenditure than non-athletes. Athletes follow diet regimens consisting of more regular meals with more protein and indulge less in health-risk behavior (smoking and alcohol consumption). However, the self-perception of health and quality of life was lower in athletes than in non-athletes. Conclusion: EU regulations and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemics prevented us from conducting a study on a more representative sample. Nevertheless, we could confirm that regular sport participation yields better physical performance and a healthier lifestyle but could also have a negative impact on health (injuries) and quality of life.",1

Thanks to the use of such research methods as: theoretical analysis and generalization of data of special scientific and methodological literature, pedagogical observation, anthropometry method, video recording, biomechanical analysis of the kinematic structure of motor actions, methods of mathematical statistics, objective data were obtained. The angles of the knee, hip, shoulder, elbow joints involved in the execution of the blow are considered. Their quantitative values, changes and differences between them at the beginning and at the end of the study were determined. It is established that the angular characteristics of the knee, hip and elbow joints in the micro-phase of the stance of the supporting leg of the preparation phase have statistically significant differences at the level of p≤0.05. Also in the micro-phase impact movement of the working phase there are statistically significant differences at the level of p≤0.05 in all four corners analyzed by us. Having received the above presented data we have developed methodical recommendations for football players of low qualification at different moments of impact by the middle part of the foot lifting on a stationary ball based on the program-target principle of organization of the training process. The comparative analysis of quantitative angular characteristics of sportsmen of high qualification and football players of low qualification after the introduction of our methodical recommendations did not reveal any significant differences in the angles, and at the beginning of the study there were significant differences in 8 angles.

They occur after a trauma to the head and can lead to a loss of consciousness. Patients suffering from a concussion commonly present with confusion, amnesia and a headache in the context of a recent head trauma. The approach to this pathology consists in making a clinical diagnosis, ruling out life-threatening complications such as fractures and intracranial hemorrhages and educating the patient on a safe recovery and return-to play. Patients that do not have worrisome symptoms can be discharged home with a responsible adult that has been informed of when to seek medical care in case of a complication. After a short rest period they should be advised to resume gradually their cognitive and physical activity.

Correlation Between Neck Strength and Heading Performance in Male Football Players,2022-10-21,2022,Lapin Press Publications (LPP),International Journal of Life Science and Pharma Research,"Benji Kakkudiyil Abraham, P. Sathya, Jibi Paul, M. Vijaya Kumar","Football, also known as soccer, is the world's most popular sport, which involves multiple factors that consist of physiological, technical, tactical, mental and physical components. The technical skills involved in the game are juggling, speed dribbling, passing, shooting and heading. Repetitive impacts of the head to the ball have been shown to result in potential overload mechanism during the game. The injuries during heading are high when the head comes in contact with the elbow (41%) and headto- head impact (32%). The need and purpose of this study is to understand the correlation between neck muscle strength and heading performance in football players. The neck strength of the flexors and the extensors was assessed by the Baseline pushpull dynamometer and to test the heading precision, The Federation Internationale de Football Association Medical Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) test battery which is designed by The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was selected. A total of 63 players were assessed and the results showed that a positive relationship is seen in the mean strength difference and the forward heading, and a positive relationship is seen in the mean strength difference and the right side heading. This study concludes that the neck extensors muscle strength and the neck flexors muscle strength are important for the heading performance in football players. Also, if the neck extensors strength is more than the neck flexors muscle strength, the heading performance was better.",1
Are sprint accelerations related to groin injuries? A biomechanical analysis of adolescent soccer players,2022-10-19,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Thomas Dupré, Wolfgang Potthast","Groin injuries have one of the highest incidences in soccer and can be career threatening, especially for adolescents, due to their high recurrence rate. Quick accelerations have been connected to groin injuries along with kicking and change of directions. Purpose of this study was to examine the hip joint kinematics, kinetics and the muscle forces of adductor longus and gracilis during first ground contact of a linear sprint acceleration performed by adolescent soccer players. Twenty-two male participants were investigated with 3D motion capture and two force plates. Inverse dynamics were used to calculate the kinematics, kinetics and muscle forces. The kinematics show a constant extension during the stance phase and a quick transition from an abduction to an adduction movement at 90% stance, which coincides with the highest forces in adductor longus and gracilis. This indicates a high load on the adductor muscles due to eccentric contractions combined with high muscle forces in the adductors. Compared to previously investigated inside passing and change of direction movements, adductor muscle forces and angular velocities are higher in this study. Therefore, it is suggested that sprint accelerations are likely to be connected to the development of groin injuries in adolescent soccer players.",1

Isokinetic strength parameters may predict return to running 4 months after ACLR using the bone–patellar–tendon–bone procedure. Materials and methods: The isokinetic knee strength of 216 patients (24.5 ± 5 years) was measured 4 months after surgery, and progressive return to running was allowed. The effectiveness of return to running was reported at 6 months. Return to running prediction was established using multivariate logistic regression. Predictive parameters were presented with a ROC curve area to define the best cut-off, with sensibility (Se) and specificity (Sp). Results: A model was established, including the limb symmetry index (LSI), and 103 patients (47.6%) were able to run between the fourth and the sixth month after surgery. These patients presented significantly fewer knee complications, a better Lysholm score, a better Quadriceps and Hamstring LSI and better quadriceps strength reported for body weight on the operated limb. The best model was established including the Quadriceps and Hamstring LSI at 60°/s and the Lysholm score. The cut-off for Quadriceps LSI was 60% (ROC curve area: 0.847; Se: 77.5%; Sp: 77%), for Hamstring LSI 90% (ROC curve area: 0.716; Se: 65.7%; Sp: 60.2%) and for Lyshom score 97 points (ROC curve area: 0.691; Se: 65%; Sp: 66%). Conclusion: Four months after ACLR using a bone–patellar–tendon–bone procedure, the Quadriceps and Hamstring LSI associated to the Lysholm score could help make the decision to allow return to running.",1
Modeling and simulation analysis of racing Go-kart-The brake system,2022-10-17,2022,GSC Online Press,Global Journal of Engineering and Technology Advances,"Ihe G.C, Okuma S.O, Didigwu C.G","Go-karts are a type of minicar that are used for racing and other types of leisure racing. There are extremely popular in countries that have an industrialized economy, and their popularity is quickly growing in countries that are still developing their economies. The performance of the vehicle is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the engine, the transmission, the chassis, and the braking system which serves as the lifeline of the vehicle. Even though there is no suspension or differentials, the chassis is nevertheless very flexible, so it can handle corners and dips just well. This Go-kart is driven by a Yamaha Vino Automatic Petrol 2-Stroke Engine, which is capable of producing around 4.1 kilowatts of power at 9018 revolutions per minute. Slick tires and a hydraulic disc brake make it easy to come to a stop in any condition, whether it's dry or wet outside. The braking system and the material qualities of its structural components receive the majority of attention throughout this research. The following information was uncovered by a static simulation analysis performed using SolidWorks: The density of the material is 7700 kg/m3, the yield strength is 6.20422e+08 N/m2, and the maximum tensile strength is 7.23826e+08 N/m2.

A Systematic Review of the Relationship between Workload and Injury Risk of Professional Male Soccer Players,2022-10-14,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Zhiyuan Jiang, Yuerong Hao, Naijing Jin, Yue Li","The number of studies on the relationship between training and competition load and injury has increased exponentially in recent years, and it is also widely studied by researchers in the field of professional soccer. In order to provide practical guidance for workload management and injury prevention in professional athletes, this study provides a review of the literature on the effect of load on injury risk, injury prediction, and interpretation mechanisms. The results of the research show that: (1) It appears that short-term fixture congestion may increase the match injury incidence, while long-term fixture congestion may have no effect on both the overall injury incidence and the match injury incidence. (2) It is impossible to determine conclusively whether any global positioning system (GPS)-derived metrics (total distance, high-speed running distance, and acceleration) are associated with an increased risk of injury. (3) The acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) of the session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) may be significantly associated with the risk of non-contact injuries, but an ACWR threshold with a minimum risk of injury could not be obtained. (4) Based on the workload and fatigue recovery factors, artificial intelligence technology may possess good predictive power regarding injury risk.",1
Perceiving the inertial properties of actions in anticipation skill,2022-10-14,2022,Elsevier BV,Psychology of Sport and Exercise,"Nicholas J. Smeeton, Johannes Meyer, Stefanie Klatt","Inertial properties of throwing or striking actions constrain action outcomes, but their role in anticipation skill has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of inertial constraints on anticipation skill. Fifteen semi-professional and fifteen novice soccer players were tasked with determining the kick direction of penalty kicks occluded at 160 ms, 80 ms before ball-foot contact, at ball-foot contact, or 80 ms after ball-foot contact. The inertial constraints were manipulated by loading the kicking leg with a 2.25 kg weight around the shank of the kicking leg and were compared with unloaded kicks. Anticipation accuracy of kick direction, response time, and decision confidence were recorded. It was found that loaded kick directions were anticipated more accurately, faster, and at earlier occlusion periods than unloaded kicks. The higher accuracy for the loaded kicks was found in the earlier occlusion conditions in experts compared to novices, as were the positive relationships between accuracy and confidence. It was concluded that the perception of the inertial constraints of the kicking action allowed for earlier anticipation of kick direction. It is proposed that accurate perception of the biomechanical property radius of gyrations in the body segments linking proximal to distal towards the kicking foot may provide this information.",1

Seventeen professional futsal players were recruited for this study (age: 23.07 ± 6.76 years; height: 1.75 ± 0.06 m; body mass: 75.47 ± 7.47 kg; playing experience in elite: 5.38 ± 2.03 years). All of them were evaluated during the preseason phase in two tests (CMJ and back squat with additional load) before and after each training session (pre- vs. post-test). A jump platform was used to extract jump height during CMJ, while a linear position transducer was used to extract mean velocity (MV) and mean propulsive velocity (MPV) during the back squat exercise. Significant differences were obtained for intra-subject analysis for MV and MPV in loaded back squat exercise (p &lt; 0.001), finding lower values during the post-test. In conclusion, the monitoring of NMS through the back squat provides greater sensitivity and objectivity in comparison with CMJ, due to a more direct neuromuscular extrapolation to the physical demands of futsal.",1
Sternoclavicular Joint Reconstruction with Semitendinosus Allograft and Suture Anchors after Recurrent Posterior Dislocation in a Professional North American Football Player,2022-10-11,2022,Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.,The Open Orthopaedics Journal,"Yung Han, Elizabeth H. Cho, Adriana Martinez, Paul A. Martineau","Background: Posterior sternoclavicular joint dislocations are an extremely rare but potentially life-threatening injury that can occur in sports. A variety of surgical procedures have been proposed, but there is no consensus on the treatment of choice. It is also largely unknown if a safe return to high-risk sports is possible. Case Presentation: We present a case of a posterior sternoclavicular joint dislocation in a 22-year-old male professional North American football player who had a recurrent irreducible posterior dislocation after initial injury management by closed reduction. The patient’s desire to return to football presented unique challenges to management. His sternoclavicular joint was subsequently reconstructed with semitendinosus allograft in a figure-of-eight augmented with suture anchors. After recovery, he returned to play as a running back in professional football symptom-free. Conclusion: Our patient's successful return to playing professional football after the sternoclavicular joint reconstruction suggests that this should be considered an effective treatment option when managing posterior sternoclavicular dislocation in high level contact sports players.",1
Kinetic Effects of 6 Weeks’ Pilates or Balance Training in College Soccer Players with Chronic Ankle Instability,2022-10-08,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Quan Jiang, Yonghwan Kim, Moonyoung Choi","Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is a common sports injury that frequently occurs in active individuals. LAS is characterized by a high recurrence rate, with a large proportion of patients progressing to chronic ankle instability (CAI). Pilates exercises have provided positive results in health care and in rehabilitation. This study compared Pilates training (PT) with traditional balance training (BT) in patients with CAI. Fifty-one college football players with CAI, divided into PT (n = 26) and BT (n = 25) groups, were included in the study. The groups performed PT or BT training as assigned, three times per week for 6 weeks. Isokinetic ankle strength, one-leg hop tests, Y-balance test (YBT), and foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS) were evaluated before and after training. There were considerable improvements in both the PT and BT groups after training. Group and time comparisons revealed that the PT group achieved better triple hop test results than the BT group, whereas the BT group exhibited a greater improvement in YBT posteromedial and posterolateral reach distances. In athletes with CAI, both PT and BT effectively improved symptoms and function. These findings suggest that ankle strength, balance, and core stability should be comprehensively evaluated and targeted in CAI rehabilitation programs.",1
Development of an ICT-Based Exergame Program for Children with Developmental Disabilities,2022-10-05,2022,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Hyunjin Kwon, Hyokju Maeng, Jinwook Chung","The purpose of this study was to develop an information and communications technology (ICT)-based exergame for children with developmental disabilities (DD) and to examine its impacts on physical fitness and fundamental motor skills (FMS). The ICT-based exergame consisted of visual and auditory demonstrations of diverse locomotor movement and object manipulation activities by the virtual characters. A total of 52 children with DD participated in the present study. The participants were divided into twenty-seven children in the experimental group and 25 children with DD in the control group. The experimental group participants engaged in the exergame program for 12 weeks. All participants’ muscle strength (i.e., standing long jump) and four fundamental motor skills, such as the horizontal jump, hop, overhand throw, and dribble, were assessed during the pre- and post-test process. There were significant impacts on physical fitness and FMS (p < 0.001) between the groups. Specifically, the results of three FMS (hop, overhand throw, and dribble) and standing long jump significantly improved in children with DD except for the horizontal jump skill. The results of this study is evidence that the ICT-based exergame program for children with DD may be utilized to improve physical fitness and FMS in children with DD.",1
On-Field Biomechanical Assessment of High and Low Dive in Competitive 16-Year-Old Goalkeepers through Wearable Sensors and Principal Component Analysis,2022-10-04,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Stefano Di Paolo, Francesco Santillozzi, Raffaele Zinno, Giuseppe Barone, Laura Bragonzoni","Diving saves are the main duty of football goalkeepers. Few biomechanical investigations of dive techniques have been conducted, none in a sport-specific environment. The present study investigated the characteristics of goalkeepers’ dive in preferred (PS) and non-preferred (nPS) side through an innovative wearables-plus-principal-component analysis (PCA) approach. Nineteen competitive academy goalkeepers (16.5 ± 3.0 years) performed a series of high and low dives on their PS and nPS. Dives were performed in a regular football goal on the pitch. Full-body kinematics were collected through 17 wearable inertial sensors (MTw Awinda, Xsens). PCA was conducted to reduce data dimensionality (input matrix 310,878 datapoints). PCA scores were extracted for each kinematic variable and compared between PS and nPS if their explained variability was >5%. In high dive, participants exhibited greater hip internal rotation and less trunk lateral tilt (p < 0.047, ES > 0.39) in PS than nPS. In low dives, players exhibited greater ipsilateral hip abduction dominance and lower trunk rotation (p < 0.037, ES > 0.40) in PS than nPS. When diving on their nPS, goalkeepers adopted sub-optimal patterns with less trunk coordination and limited explosiveness. An ecological testing through wearables and PCA might help coaches to inspect relevant diving characteristics and improve training effectiveness.",1
The Impact of Fatigue on Performance and Biomechanical Variables—A Narrative Review with Prospective Methodology,2022-10-01,2022,MDPI AG,Biomechanics,"Michele Aquino, John Petrizzo, Robert M. Otto, John Wygand","Landing kinetics and kinematics have historically been correlated with potential injury. A factor that requires more attention associated with its correlation to injury risk includes the impact of physiological fatigue. Fatigue is a multifaceted phenomenon involving central and peripheral factors resulting in a slowing or cessation of motor unit firing and a decrease in maximal force and power. Sports participation rarely results in momentary muscular failure occurring, as many sports consist of intermittent periods of activity that are interspersed with short rest periods that allow for recovery to take place. However, over the course of the competition, fatigue can still accumulate and can result in impaired performance. Current literature on the topic struggles to replicate the peripheral and central metabolic stresses required to induce a state of fatigue that would be equivalent to athletic exposure. Furthermore, the current literature fails to demonstrate consistency regarding the kinetic implications associated with fatigue, which may be secondary to the inconsistencies associated with fatigue protocols utilized. This article focuses on providing an overview of the current literature associated with fatigue’s impact on the kinetics associated with landing from a jump. The article will provide a prospective methodology utilizing repeat bouts of the Wingate Anaerobic Power Test. The proposed protocol may help further our understanding of the relationship between fatigue and lower extremity biomechanics.",1

Ten years of football (soccer) injuries in the literature. A bibliometric approach,2022-09-29,2022,"Esmon Publicidad, SA",Archivos de Medicina del Deporte,"Diana H. Guzmán-Vásquez, María A. Rueda-Calderón, Juan Medino-Muñoz","The aim of this research is to analyse the scientific production of publications produced during a decade (2010-2019) about injuries in football (soccer). A bibliographic search was done for publications featuring key terms such as football, soccer, and injuries. We searched for studies in journals that had a five-year impact factor in the Journal Citation Report in the “Sport Sciences” category. The PRISMA methodology was used. The following bibliometric indicators were analysed: number of publications by journal; country of origin; country of publication; publications per year; number of authors; authors’ native language; evidence level; type of study; sex; anatomical location and topographic location of injuries. To assess the level of evidence, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) level of evidence classification was used, dichotomised as follows: articles with level 1 and level 2 evidence were ‘high evidence’, and articles with levels 3, 4, and 5 were ‘low evidence’. The statistical tests were performed using SPSS V. 28. A total of 222 articles published in four journals met the inclusion criteria. Production rose as the decade progressed. The highest frequency was in 2013. The British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM) had the highest number of publications. Sports Medicine (SM) had the most authors per article and the highest level of evidence. The United States was the main producer. There were more publications regarding injuries in males, and in males and females, compared to publications that only took females into account. More muscle, thigh, and hip injuries were described. The level of evidence was generally low. The increase in scientific production related to football (soccer) injuries during the decade reflect an elevated interest for the subject matter. Publications that prevail around this theme consider injuries in the thigh and lower extremities and in men.",1
The Selecting Optimal Ball-Receiving Body Parts Using Pose Sequence Analysis and Sports Biomechanics,2022-09-29,2022,Wiley,Mobile Information Systems,Hui Du,"The purpose is to explore a personalized and targeted training mode in football player training. Firstly, this work introduces the principle and advantages of machine vision sensing. Secondly, from the biomechanical point of view, the influence of the acceleration of several joints and the joint angle on the ball receiving effect is analyzed. Furthermore, the football player’s in-game receiving image is collected using machine vision technology, and the pose image data are preprocessed to construct a data set. Then, a new model is constructed and trained using Haar-like feature (HLF) and (Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost). Finally, the recognition model of the football receiving pose is tested, and the recognition effect is compared with the mainstream recognition model. The results show that the recognition parameter of the traditional method based on the Halcon recognition pose system is 5.12 at 20 times and then begins to decline. In contrast, the identification parameters based on the Industrial Robot Vision System Development (IRVSD) platform are much higher than those based on Halcon. It slightly decreases when the training times are 60 and then gradually increases. However, the recognition parameters based on the proposed machine vision have been far higher than those of the two traditional methods and maintained at about 10. This is because the proposed method extracts the foul image features, establishes the pose sequence potential function, and analyzes it in more detail, thus improving the recognition accuracy. The player’s pose recognition model based on HLF and AdaBoost algorithm can identify and evaluate the ball-receiving pose, thus guiding the receiving improvement. The finding shows that the proposed recognition technology can recognize and evaluate the players’ ball-receiving image, providing a new direction for applying artificial intelligence technology in sports.",1
A Systematic Review of the Genetic Predisposition to Injury in Football,2022-09-28,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Science in Sport and Exercise,"Alexander B. T. McAuley, David C. Hughes, Loukia G. Tsaprouni, Ian Varley, Bruce Suraci, Thomas R. Roos, Adam J. Herbert, Daniel T. Jackson, Adam L. Kelly","Abstract Purpose Synthesise genetic association studies investigating injury involving football players to identify which genetic variants have the most empirical evidence to date. Methods A comprehensive search of the PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and MEDLINE databases until March 11th 2022 identified 34 studies. Inclusion criteria: primary investigations, included football players, examined the association of a genetic variant with injury, and were published in English. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. A narrative synthesis summarised results. Results There were 33 candidate gene studies and one genome-wide study, with 9642 participants across all studies (range = 43–1311; median = 227). Ninety-nine polymorphisms were assessed within 63 genes. Forty-one polymorphisms were associated with injury once. Three polymorphisms had their specific allelic associations with injury replicated twice in independent cohorts: ACTN3 (rs1815739) XX genotype was associated with an increased susceptibility to non-contact muscle injuries, ACAN (rs1516797) G allele was associated with increased susceptibility to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and VEGFA (rs2010963) CC genotype was associated with an increased susceptibility to ACL and ligament or tendon injuries. However, several methodological issues (e.g., small sample sizes, cohort heterogeneity, and population stratification) are prevalent that limit the reliability and external validity of findings. Conclusion At present, the evidence base supporting the integration of genetic information as a prognostic or diagnosis tool for injury risk in football is weak. Future participation of organisations in international consortia is suggested to combat the current methodological issues and subsequently improve clarity concerning the underlying genetic contribution to injury susceptibility.",1
Graft Diameter Should Reflect the Size of the Native Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) to Improve the Outcome of ACL Reconstruction: A Finite Element Analysis,2022-09-27,2022,MDPI AG,Bioengineering,"Huizhi Wang, Mingzhu Tao, Qinyi Shi, Kaixin He, Cheng-Kung Cheng","The size of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) often varies between individuals, but such variation is not typically considered during ACL reconstruction (ACLR). This study aimed to explore how the size of the ACL affects the selection of a suitable graft diameter. A finite element model of a human knee was implanted with intact ACLs of different dimensions (0.95, 1 and 1.05 times the size of the original ACL) and with grafts of different diameters, to simulate ACLR (diameter 7.5-12 mm in 0.5 mm increments). The knee models were flexed to 30° and loaded with an anterior tibial load of 103 N, internal tibial moment of 7.5 Nm, and valgus tibial moment of 6.9 Nm. Knee kinematics (anterior tibial translation (ATT), internal tibial rotation (ITR) and valgus tibial rotation (VTR)) and ligament forces were recorded and compared among the different groups. The results showed that, compared with the intact knee, a graft diameter of 7.5 mm was found to increase the ATT and VTR, but reduce the graft force. Increasing the graft diameter reduced knee laxity and increased the graft force. A 10% increase in the size of the ACL corresponded to a 3 mm larger graft diameter required to restore knee stability and graft force after ACLR. It was concluded that the graft diameter should be selected according to the dimensions of the native ACL, for better restoration of knee functionality. This study may help to improve the clinical treatment of ACL ruptures.",1
Managing the Wellbeing of Elite Rugby Union Players from an Occupational Safety and Health Perspective,2022-09-27,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Yanbing Chen, Conor Buggy, Seamus Kelly","The intense, physical contact nature of rugby union often encourages the normalization of risk-taking behaviour resulting in a relatively high acceptance of risk. This study aims to explore safety culture in rugby union from an OSH perspective, with the purpose of assisting coaches and management in their decision-making processes to improve players’ health, welfare, and long-term well-being. In terms of data collection, this study involved semi-structured interviews with senior support staff (n = 15) in elite rugby union. Interview transcripts underwent inductive analysis prior to an abductive analysis that was guided by an established occupational-safety-and-health (OSH) framework. Rugby union players’ safety can be considered from two dimensions: management’s commitment to safety (i.e., safety prioritization, safety empowerment, and safety justice), players’ involvement in safety (i.e., safety prioritization, and trust in other players’ safety competence, and players’ safety concern for the opposition players). Within the themes identified, players’ attitude towards their opponents’ safety which has been rarely considered as a factor for injury prevention is also discussed in this study. If sport support staff (i.e., managers/coaches/medical) can become more involved in players’ performance-orientated training using OSH management processes to aid in their decision-making, their exists the capacity to benefit players’ safe return to play after injury rehabilitation. Meanwhile, directing the development of appropriate behavioural educational interventions to raise safety-awareness amongst players can improve their long-term health and well-being and provide them with the necessary safety and health information to support their own decision-making processes. As a multidisciplinary design, this study contributes new multidisciplinary insights that have the potential to advance managerial practices utilizing an OSH perspective, including decision-making supporting risk alleviation for safety and long-term health and wellbeing initiatives in competitive team sports.",1
CORRELATION BETWEEN BODY MASS INDEX TOWARDS AGILITY FOOTBALL ATHLETES IN MELAWI REGENCY,2022-09-26,2022,Universitas Udayana,Sport and Fitness Journal,"Muhammad Yasir Hidayat, Putu Ayu Sita Saraswati, Made Widnyana, Gede Parta Kinandana","Agility is used by soccer athletes when passing opponents by dribbling the ball in order to score goals more easily. Body Mass Index (BMI) affects agility. Athletes who have a normal BMI have better agility which is useful for displaying their maximum abilities. Athletes with an abnormal BMI can result in decreased agility and an increased risk of injury. This study aims to determine the correlation between BMI and agility in soccer athletes in Melawi Regency.This research is an analytic observational study with a cross sectional approach. The sample of this study amounted to 105 people who were selected using non-probability sampling technique with purposive sampling method. Agility was measured by t-test, while BMI was measured by the result of body weight () divided by the square of height () adjusted by category.Based on the non-parametric chi-square analysis test, the results were p = 0.021 (p&lt;0.05) which indicates that there is a significant correlation between BMI and agility, where the lower the BMI, the higher the agility. This is because the higher the BMI causes an increase in the load that can inhibit muscle contraction.Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that there is a significant correlation between body mass index and agility in soccer athletes in Melawi Regency.&#x0D; Keywords : Body Mass Index (BMI); agility; football athletes",1
Reliability of wearable sensors-based parameters for the assessment of knee stability,2022-09-22,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Andrea Baldazzi, Luca Molinaro, Juri Taborri, Fabrizio Margheritini, Stefano Rossi, Elena Bergamini","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture represents one of the most recurrent knee injuries in soccer players. To allow a safe return to sport after ACL reconstruction, standardised and reliable procedures/criteria are needed. In this context, wearable sensors are gaining momentum as they allow obtaining objective information during sport-specific and in-the-field tasks. This paper aims at proposing a sensor-based protocol for the assessment of knee stability and at quantifying its reliability. Seventeen soccer players performed a single leg squat and a cross over hop test. Each participant was equipped with two magnetic-inertial measurement units located on the tibia and foot. Parameters related to the knee stability were obtained from linear acceleration and angular velocity signals. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimum detectable change (MDC) were calculated to evaluate each parameter reliability. The ICC ranged from 0.29 to 0.84 according to the considered parameter. Specifically, angular velocity-based parameters proved to be more reliable than acceleration-based counterparts, particularly in the cross over hop test (average ICC values of 0.46 and 0.63 for acceleration- and angular velocity-based parameters, respectively). An exception was represented, in the single leg squat, by parameters extracted from the acceleration trajectory on the tibial transverse plane (0.60≤ICC≤0.76), which can be considered as promising candidates for ACL injury risk assessment. Overall, greater ICC values were found for the dominant limb, with respect to the non-dominant one (average ICC: 0.64 and 0.53, respectively). Interestingly, this between-limb difference in variability was not always mirrored by LSI results. MDC values provide useful information in the perspective of applying the proposed protocol on athletes with ACL reconstruction. Thus, The outcome of this study sets the basis for the definition of reliable and objective criteria for return to sport clearance after ACL injury.",1

Weekly Training Load across a Standard Microcycle in a Sub-Elite Youth Football Academy: A Comparison between Starters and Non-Starters,2022-09-15,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"José E. Teixeira, Luís Branquinho, Ricardo Ferraz, Miguel Leal, António J. Silva, Tiago M. Barbosa, António M. Monteiro, Pedro Forte","Compensatory training sessions have been highlighted as useful strategies to solve the differential weekly training load between the players’ starting status. However, the influence of the players’ starting status is still understudied in sub-elite youth football. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the weekly training load on a standard microcycle in starters and non-starters of a sub-elite youth football academy. The weekly training load of 60 young sub-elite football players was monitored during a 6-week period using an 18 Hz global positioning system (GPS), 1 Hz telemetry heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and total quality recovery (TQR). The total distance (TD) covered presented a significant difference between starters and non-starters with a moderate effect (t = −2.38, Δ = −428.03 m, p = 0.018, d = 0.26). Training volume was higher in non-starters than in starter players (TDStarters = 5105.53 ± 1684.22 vs. TDNon-starters = 5533.56 ± 1549.26 m). Significant interactive effects were found between a player’s starting status, playing time, and session duration in overall training load variables for within (F = 140.46; η2 = 0.85; p &lt; 0.001) and between-subjects (F = 11.63 to 160.70; η2 = 0.05 to 0.76; p &lt; 0.001). The player’s starting status seems to only influence the training volume in sub-elite youth football, unless one considers the covariance of the playing time and session duration. Consequently, coaches should prioritize complementary training to equalize training volume and emphasize similar practice opportunities for non-starters. Future studies should evaluate the gap between training and match load, measuring the impact of recovery and compensatory sessions.",1
Consensus Head Acceleration Measurement Practices (CHAMP): Laboratory Validation of Wearable Head Kinematic Devices,2022-09-14,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,"Lee Gabler, Declan Patton, Mark Begonia, Ray Daniel, Ahmad Rezaei, Colin Huber, Gunter Siegmund, Tyler Rooks, Lyndia Wu","Wearable devices are increasingly used to measure real-world head impacts and study brain injury mechanisms. These devices must undergo validation testing to ensure they provide reliable and accurate information for head impact sensing, and controlled laboratory testing should be the first step of validation. Past validation studies have applied varying methodologies, and some devices have been deployed for on-field use without validation. This paper presents best practices recommendations for validating wearable head kinematic devices in the laboratory, with the goal of standardizing validation test methods and data reporting. Key considerations, recommended approaches, and specific considerations were developed for four main aspects of laboratory validation, including surrogate selection, test conditions, data collection, and data analysis. Recommendations were generated by a group with expertise in head kinematic sensing and laboratory validation methods and reviewed by a larger group to achieve consensus on best practices. We recommend that these best practices are followed by manufacturers, users, and reviewers to conduct and/or review laboratory validation of wearable devices, which is a minimum initial step prior to on-field validation and deployment. We anticipate that the best practices recommendations will lead to more rigorous validation of wearable head kinematic devices and higher accuracy in head impact data, which can subsequently advance brain injury research and management.",1
Effect of Platelet-Rich Plasma Augmentation on Endoscopy-Assisted Percutaneous Achilles Tendon Repair,2022-09-14,2022,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Chun-Yu Hung, Shih-Jie Lin, Chia-Yi Yeh, Wen-Ling Yeh","Background: Achilles tendon ruptures are one of the most common sports injuries. Recently, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been widely used in tendon-related disorders to enhance tendon healing. However, studies regarding PRP treatment in Achilles tendon rupture show inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PRP in patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture treated with endoscopy-assisted percutaneous repair. Methods: A total of 62 patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture treated with surgical repair from January 2014 to December 2018 were enrolled in this study. Surgical repair in conjunction with PRP augmentation after surgery was classified as the PRP group. Surgical repair without PRP augmentation was classified as the non-PRP group. All patients were followed up at least 2 years post-operation. The outcomes were evaluated on the basis of rate of return to sports, time to return to play, Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS), calf circumference ratio, ankle range of motion (ROM) and complications following surgery. Results: At 2-year follow-up, the ATRS score was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.8), but the ATRS score in both groups improved with time. Rate of return to sports and time to return to play were not different between the two groups (p = 1.00). Moreover, calf circumference ratio and ankle ROM were evaluated at 6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month follow-ups. At 6 months, the PRP group had better ankle ROM (p = 0.003) and a higher calf circumference ratio (p = 0.011); however, at the 24-month evaluation, there were no between-group differences regarding calf circumference ratio, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: We show that PRP augmentation in Achilles tendon surgery did not yield superior functional and clinical outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should inform patients of the above information when undergoing Achilles tendon surgery and offer correct expectations to family and patients regrading PRP treatment.",1

A research study with an appropriate experimental design and precise execution is necessary to produce high-quality results. A pilot study can be conducted as an external pilot study apart from the main study or as an internal pilot study integrated into the main study's research plan. This paper will review the research conducted from a pilot project to identify the design factors such as anatomy, anthropometry, biomechanics and physical characteristics for a soccer shoe popular amongst Malaysian soccer players. The objectives of this research are to determine the accuracy of the questionnaire items. The initial sample consisted of 50 Men soccer players from Peninsular Malaysian states are randomly selected from various levels of the game and have at least one year of playing experience. This study used the quantitative method, whereby questionnaires were applied to obtain information from respondents and findings were analyzed using SPSS software version 23.0 to calculate the Cronbach's Alpha reliability index. The validation of the instrument involves a total of two expert panels. A total of 84-item survey is divided into 4 sections, covering the demographic information of the respondents, their professional backgrounds, their opinions on soccer shoes, and their perceptions on shoe design elements. This study has shown that 81 items were appropriate to be utilized to measure the selection of soccer shoes design. Overall, these results indicate that the analysis has statistically proved that the items in this instrument has a high degree of validity and reliability and can be used for study’s actual sample. The high value of the alpha coefficients suggest that the instruments is very reliable and capable of determining the accuracy of the questionnaire items.",1
Big picture transdisciplinary practice - extending key ideas of a Department of Methodology towards a wider ecological view of practitioner-scientist integration,2022-09-12,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Coaching Review,"Fabian Otte, Martyn Rothwell, Keith Davids","In high-performance sport, a multidisciplinary approach is proposed as essential in providing an effective environment to service all aspects of athlete development and performance. A Department of Methodology (DoM) conceptualisation, based on an ecological dynamics rationale, provides a framework for coaches, sport scientists and support practitioners to collaboratively conceptualise integrated team and athlete development practices. Previous research has highlighted several principles for holistic system development of athletes, such as importance of embracing non-linearity, prioritising athlete–environment relations, and identifying constraints on performance. While sports organisations are continuously shaped by constraints operating at multiple scales, the overarching purpose of this paper is to highlight specifically how macro-scale ecological constraints may shape integrated practice design from a transdisciplinary perspective. To achieve this aim, we expound on the DoM concept by drawing on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model of human development, to elaborate on how interconnected system components, simultaneously operating at multiple scales, continuously contextualise athlete development experiences. Further, we seek to sensitise coaches, scientists, and support staff to the 'big-picture of athlete development', discussing how sports organisations may adapt to the ubiquitous influences of macro-scale ecological systems (e.g., national associations and sport governing bodies). Finally, numerous association football (soccer) examples, and a recent case report about developments within the German FA (DFB) and youth football structure, attempt to make theoretical ideas tangible and understandable for coaching practitioners in the field.",1

The demands of the sport have been observed, studied, and replicated to be reproduced in a more controlled, laboratory setting in forms of various exercise protocols designed to mimic actual soccer match-play. However, the development and selection of a simulation has varied across studies. This review aims to compile and align various protocols in simulating soccer match-play to identify and evaluate the feasibility of incorporating different simulations into various studies in the sport.

This paper is the first narrative review to discuss numerous protocols used in research towards reproducing soccer match-play demands in a lab-controlled environment.",1
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury and Return to Sport: A Commentary on the Different Factors Impacting the Relation,2022-09-09,2022,California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences and Psychology LLC,Journal For International Medical Graduates,Hadi Farhat,"Since the 1960s and up until now, the diagnosis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury has been evolving. ACL injury is highly prevalent in contact sports such as the NBA and NFL. This critical commentary highlights the significant tests used throughout history to diagnose and treat ACL injury. The factors affecting the return to sports after this injury are also accentuated along with the possibility of getting a second ACL injury after return to play. Our commentary demonstrates the need for greater awareness of comorbidities because it is known that they affect how an ACL tear is treated.",1
Development and trainability of agility in youth: A systematic scoping review,2022-09-08,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Lutz Thieschäfer, Dirk Büsch","Agility is acknowledged as a crucial factor of performance in various open skill sports in both adult and youth athletes. However, despite its significance for sports performance the development and the trainability of agility are under-researched within the pediatric literature. A systematic scoping review was considered most appropriate to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of the current body of literature approaching agility in youth.The objectives of this scoping review were to map the extent, range, and nature of existing evidence regarding trainability and ""natural"" development of agility and to summarize corresponding study results.The scoping review protocol was pre-registered at Open Science Framework. Systematic searches were conducted using the databases PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, SURF, and SPONET to identify sources covering agility in youth. Among other inclusion criteria, only references applying unplanned agility concepts were included.Ultimately, 41 reports were included comprising 23 observational studies, 14 experimental studies, and 4 references of secondary research. A total of 3,087 subjects were assessed in the included studies. Subject groups were predominantly male, above 10 years of age, and soccer athletes. Outcomes of observational studies indicate an effect of age and maturation on agility performance resulting in a non-linear ""natural"" development of agility. Furthermore, relationships between contributing perceptual-cognitive factors and agility performance tend to increase with progressing age, whereas relationships between physical factors and agility performance diminish. Evidence of training studies suggests that agility is trainable in youth, albeit with various underlying mechanisms.This systematic scoping review is the first mapping of the body of literature about agility in youth. It outlines the current evidence base, reveals research gaps, and points out future directions to support researchers and practitioners in this field. Although, increasing research activity in this field is discernible, agility research in youth is still in its infancy. Considering the significance of agility for sports performance, future research is postulated to design evidence-based strategies for long-term agility development in young athletes.",1
Myofascial and Movement Tests after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2022-09-08,2022,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Maciej Biały, Kamil Kublin, Grażyna Brzuszkiewicz-Kuźmicka, Rafał Gnat","Functional evaluation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the key points involved in decision making about the return of patients to full and unrestricted physical activity. The objective of the present study was to verify whether myofascial chain NEURAC® and Functional Movement Screen (FMS™) tests can be used to detect functional differences between the operated and the non-operated extremity in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. A total of 83 young and physically active recreational athletes (mean age: 26.9 ± 9.7 years) who underwent primary single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using an autogenous semitendinosus-gracilis tendon graft were evaluated between the 3rd and the 4th month after surgery. Subjects received a similar, standardised rehabilitation programme. Two experienced raters, blinded to the objective of this study, were involved in functional outcome data collection using myofascial NEURAC® and Functional Movement Screen tests. Only two of the NEURAC® tests showed significant differences in the results between the operated and the non-operated extremity: the supine bridging (mean 2.92 vs. 3.51 points, p < 0.001) and prone bridging (mean 2.76 vs. 3.67 points, p < 0.001) tests. Additionally, the summary score of all NEURAC® tests significantly differed between extremities (mean 12.08 for the operated vs. 13.67 points for the non-operated extremity, p < 0.001). Myofascial tests (supine and prone bridging) in comparison with a battery of Functional Movement Screen tests seem to be more effective in detecting functional differences between the operated and the non-operated extremity at the early stage of recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",1
How Do Elite Female Athletes Cope with Symptoms of Their Premenstrual Period? A Study on Rugby Union and Football Players’ Perceived Physical Ability and Well-Being,2022-09-06,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Roberto Modena, Elisa Bisagno, Federico Schena, Simone Carazzato, Francesca Vitali","Women's participation in sports has recently grown worldwide, including in sports typically associated with men (e.g., rugby and football). Similarly, literature on female athletes has increased, but how they cope with premenstrual (PM) physical and affective symptoms remains a poorly studied topic. Our study aimed to explain which coping strategies elite female rugby and football players use during their PM period to maintain perceived physical ability (PPA) and well-being. A mediation model analysis considering coping strategies (i.e., avoiding harm, awareness and acceptance, adjusting energy, self-care, and communicating) as independent variables, PPA and well-being as dependent variables, and PM physical and affective symptoms and PM cognitive resources as mediators was run on the data collected via an anonymous online survey. A dysfunctional impact of avoiding harm (indirect) and adjusting energy (both direct and indirect) and a functional indirect influence of awareness and acceptance, self-care, and communicating as coping strategies were found on PPA and well-being during the PM period. As predicted, PM physical and affective symptoms as mediators reduced PPA and well-being, while PM cognitive resources enhanced them. These results may inform practitioners on how to support elite female athletes' PPA and well-being by knowing and reinforcing the most functional PM coping strategies for them.",1
Accuracy of flight time and countermovement-jump height estimated from videos at different frame rates with MyJump,2022-09-05,2022,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Basilio Pueo, Will Hopkins, Alfonso Penichet-Tomas, Jose Jimenez-Olmedo","Recent improvements in smartphone video technology may provide sufficient accuracy for estimation of jump height via flight time determined from video recordings of vertical-jump tests. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of jump height estimated from videos at different frame rates. High-definition videos of 10 young adults (6 males, 4 females) performing 5 countermovement jumps were recorded at a frame rate of 1000 Hz and transcoded to frame rates of 120, 240, and 480 Hz. Flight time in the videos was assessed independently by three observers at each of the four frame rates with MyJump. Flight time and jump height were analyzed with mixed models for estimation of means and of standard deviations representing technical error of measurement (free of within-subject jump-to-jump variability) at each frame rate. The four frame rates and three observers produced practically identical estimates of mean jump height. The technical errors at 120, 240, 480 and 1000 Hz were respectively 3.4, 1.8, 1.2 and 0.8 ms for flight time, and 1.4%, 0.7%, 0.5% and 0.3% for jump height. Assessed relative to either differences in jump height between elite football players (standard deviation of ~12%) or the smallest expected test-retest variability (typical error of ~3%), the technical error was substantial at 120 Hz but negligible at 240 Hz or higher. In conclusion, use of frame rates above 240 Hz to estimate jump height with MyJump will not improve accuracy substantially.",1
Differences in the manifestation of balance according to BMI levels for women students of the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports,2022-09-05,2022,Romanian Association of Balneology,Balneo and PRM Research Journal,"George-Danut Mocanu, Ilie Onu","Abstract Background: Static and dynamic balance are factors of major importance in the manifestation of human motor skills at a higher level. Purpose: The determination of vari-ations in the performance of balance tests for young women students at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports (48 cases in the 1st year of bachelor's degree), divided and analyzed 3 BMI levels (underweight / 7 cases, normal weight / 34 cases and overweight / 7 cases) and comparing these results with other similar research. Material and method: The testing of the group was scheduled at the Research Center for Human Performance, be-longing to the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in Galați, in the month of April of the 2018-2019 academic year. For the assessment of balance, 7 tests were used, of which 4 associated with dynamic postural stability (Walk and turn field sobriety test/errors, Func-tional reach test/cm, Fukuda test/degrees of rotation, Bass test/ points) and 3 measuring static stability (Flamingo test/falls, One leg standing with eyes closed/sec, Stork test/sec). Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U) were applied to compare differences between batches. Results: The average values of underweight and normal-weight women are better than those of overweight women for the entire set of assessment tests. The underweight group has the best results for the Standing balance test, Functional reach test, Flamingo test, Walk and turn field sobriety test, Fukuda test, and the normal weight women for Stork test, respectively Bass test. We found a lack of significant thresholds when comparing the results between the 3 groups (P&gt; 0.05) for Stork test, Standing balance test and Functional reach test, so the working hypothesis formulated is only partially confirmed. The only significant difference between underweight and normal weight (P &lt;0.05) is found in the Flamingo test, with better values for underweight. Significant difference thresholds for Flamingo test and Fukuda test are recorded between the underweight and overweight groups (Z values have associated thresholds P&lt;0.05). The most significant differences are found between the normal weight and overweight groups (P &lt;0.05), respectively for the Bass test, Fukuda test and Walk and turn field sobriety test. Conclusion: Constant physical activity (as a feature of the analyzed group) reduces the chances of significant differences in all balance tests between BMI levels.

Assessment of deep learning pose estimates for sports collision tracking,2022-09-02,2022,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Richard Blythman, Manan Saxena, Gregory J. Tierney, Chris Richter, Aljosa Smolic, Ciaran Simms","Injury assessment during sporting collisions requires estimation of the associated kinematics. While marker-based solutions are widely accepted as providing accurate and reliable measurements, setup times are lengthy and it is not always possible to outfit athletes with restrictive equipment in sporting situations. A new generation of markerless motion capture based on deep learning techniques holds promise for enabling measurement of movement in the wild. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of a popular deep learning model ""out of the box"" for human pose estimation, on a dataset of ten staged rugby tackle movements performed in a marker-based motion capture laboratory with a system of three high-speed video cameras. An analysis of the discrepancy between joint positions estimated by the marker-based and markerless systems shows that the deep learning approach performs acceptably well in most instances, although high errors exist during challenging intervals of heavy occlusion and self-occlusion. In total, 75.6% of joint position estimates are found to have a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than or equal to 25 mm, 17.8% with MAE between 25 and 50 mm and 6.7% with MAE greater than 50 mm.

Machine-learned-based prediction of lower extremity overuse injuries using pressure plates,2022-09-02,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Loren Nuyts, Arne De Brabandere, Sam Van Rossom, Jesse Davis, Benedicte Vanwanseele","Although running has many benefits for both the physical and mental health, it also involves the risk of injuries which results in negative physical, psychological and economical consequences. Those injuries are often linked to specific running biomechanical parameters such as the pressure pattern of the foot while running, and they could potentially be indicative for future injuries. Previous studies focus solely on some specific type of running injury and are often only applicable to a gender or running-experience specific population. The purpose of this study is, for both male and female, first-year students, (i) to predict the development of a lower extremity overuse injury in the next 6 months based on foot pressure measurements from a pressure plate and (ii) to identify the predictive loading features. For the first objective, we developed a machine learning pipeline that analyzes foot pressure measurements and predicts whether a lower extremity overuse injury is likely to occur with an AUC of 0.639 and a Brier score of 0.201. For the second objective, we found that the higher pressures exerted on the forefoot are the most predictive for lower extremity overuse injuries and that foot areas from both the lateral and the medial side are needed. Furthermore, there are two kinds of predictive features: the angle of the FFT coefficients and the coefficients of the autoregressive AR process. However, these features are not interpretable in terms of the running biomechanics, limiting its practical use for injury prevention.",1
Barriers and facilitators to the adoption and implementation of evidence-based injury prevention training programmes: a narrative review,2022-09-01,2022,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Mary Catherine Minnig, Lauren Hawkinson, Hayley J Root, Jeffrey Driban, Lindsay J DiStefano, Leigh Callahan, Kirsten R Ambrose, Jeffrey T Spang, Yvonne M Golightly","While there is a multitude of evidence supporting the efficacy of injury prevention training programmes, the literature investigating the implementation of these programmes is, in contrast, rather limited. This narrative review sought to describe the commonly reported barriers and facilitators of the implementation of injury prevention training programmes among athletes in organised sport. We also aimed to identify necessary steps to promote the uptake and sustainable use of these programmes in non-elite athletic communities. We identified 24 publications that discussed implementing evidence-based injury prevention training programmes. Frequently reported barriers to implementation include the perceived time and financial cost of the programme, coaches lacking confidence in their ability to implement it, and the programme including exercises that were difficult or confusing to follow. Frequently reported facilitators to implementation include the coach being aware of programme efficacy, shared motivation to complete the programme from both coaches and athletes, and the ability to easily integrate the programme into practice schedules. The current literature is focused on high-income, high-resource settings. We recommend that future studies focus on understanding the best practices of programme dissemination in culturally and economically diverse regions. Programmes ought to be of no financial burden to the user, be simply adaptable to different sports and individual athletes and be available for use in easily accessible forms, such as in a mobile smartphone application.",1
Epidemiology of sport-related concussion rates in female contact/collision sport: a systematic review,2022-09-01,2022,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Ayrton Walshe, Ed Daly, Lisa Ryan","To determine sport-related concussion (SRC) incidence rates in female contact/collision sport.Systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.Four databases (PubMed, SportsDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched for data from 2012 to 2021.Studies reporting SRC incidence rates or the number of concussions and athletic exposures (AEs) per 1000 participating events or hours in healthy female contact and collision sport athletes of any age were included.The search yielded 8438 non-duplicate articles. Following screening, 19 were included in the analysis (median quality score=70%), with 8 reporting match or training incidence rates. Studies were primarily from US high school and collegiate populations; data are reported for eight sports. Rugby union reported the highest match SRC rates (8.2-16.11 per 1000 AE hours), followed by Gaelic football (5.21 per 1000 AE hours) and soccer (2.08-4.04 per 1000 AE events). Where available, match SRC rates were substantially higher than training and overall SRC rates.Female sports such as rugby union, Gaelic football and soccer present the highest risk for SRCs within the available data. Previous research indicates a potentially greater injury burden for female athletes experiencing SRCs than their male counterparts. Thus, future research should analyse concussion knowledge and return-to-play protocols in these sports. Future research should also prioritise exploration of the gap in SRC rates within amateur sports, and data should be presented specifically in the context of athletic exposures (match vs training).CRD42021281569.",1

To date, no study has documented ATR's mechanism in professional football players.To describe the mechanisms, situational patterns and gross biomechanics (kinematics) of ATR injuries in professional male football players.Eighty-six (n=86) consecutive ATR injuries in professional football players during official matches were identified. Sixty (70%) injury videos were identified for mechanism and situational pattern, with biomechanical analysis feasible in 42 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated the injury videos. Distribution of ATR during the season, the match play and on the field were also reported.Fifty (n=50, 83%) injuries were classified as non-contact and 10 (17%) as indirect contact. ATRs are injuries occurring during accelerations; three main situational patterns were identified: (1) forward acceleration from standing (n=25, 42%); (2) cross-over cutting (n=15, 25%) and (3) vertical jumping (n=11, 18%). Biomechanically, ATR injuries were consistent with a multiplanar loading at the injury frame consisting of a slightly flexed trunk (15.5°), extended hip (-19.5°), early flexed knee (22.5°) and end-range dorsiflexed (40°) ankle in the sagittal plane and foot pronation; 27 (45%) ATRs occurred in the first 30 min of effective match time.All ATRs in professional football were either non-contact (83%) or indirect contact (17%) injuries. The most common situational patterns were forward acceleration from standing, cross-over cutting and vertical jumping. Biomechanics was consistent and probably triggered by a multiplanar, although predominantly sagittal, loading of the injured Achilles tendon.",1
FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022: Solutions to the Physical Fitness Challenge,2022-09-01,2022,Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,"Hassane Zouhal, Benjamin Barthélémy","In 2022, the FIFA World Cup has been scheduled to take place in Qatar in November and December, months which coincide with the in-season period of the European soccer season. This will be challenging for the staff of the participating national teams and the domestic clubs to which participating players are attached. The aim of this letter to the editor is to propose solutions on how to manage the associated challenges. Regular training and competition over the course of a season in European professional soccer is generally characterized by a pre-competition preparation period of five to six weeks, followed by two competition phases, interspersed with a winter break (Eliakim et al., 2018). Certain leagues such as the English Premier League do not typically have a winter break meaning that games are played almost continuously across the season. During World Cup years, there is usually an average of four to five weeks between the end of national domestic championships and the start of the World Cup tournament (Table 1, Figure 1) which traditionally takes place during the off-season period. However, in 2022, the FIFA World Cup has been scheduled to take place in November and December, months which coincide with the in-season period of the European soccer season (Figure 1). With the World Cup being staged during this part of the season, many national team players (notably those in the major European Leagues) will have just one week of preparation between the last match of their domestic leagues and the start of the World Cup tournament (November 20th, 2022). More precisely, the major European soccer leagues will interrupt match schedules between November 9th and 13th with differences in the number of games completed at this time of the season ranging from 14 to 17 across the various leagues (Table 2). The physical and mental demands placed on modern professional players have steadily risen over recent years due to an increase in the number of matches played during congested periods across the season (Anderson et al., 2016). Since the number of matches is not evenly distributed across the typical 40-week season, players can often compete in as many as three matches in a seven-day period. Aside from the physical and mental demands that are imposed during a match, players might experience insufficient recovery between these games; in part due to extensive travelling which can disrupt the sleep/wake cycle (Lastella et al., 2019). Indeed, poor quality of sleep and the stress induced by a match can negatively affect physical fitness and may even increase the risk of sustaining injuries and/or infections (Clemente et al., 2021) in the period leading up to the World Cup. National teams are composed of players from different leagues who have varying levels of exposure to match-play (e.g., starters, non-starters) in terms of the average weekly volume of soccer matches at their clubs (“Rapports - Observatoire du football CIES”). Moreover, both starters and non-starters are exposed to different external match and training loads (Anderson et al., 2016). External loads have previously been defined as the overall volume of activity that a player performs during both training sessions and matches (Ravé et al., 2020). There is evidence that this metric correlates with a player’s physical fitness status (Clemente et al., 2019) and their injury risk (Malone et al., 2017). Accordingly, it will be challenging for national teams to manage the fitness of players such that they are physically ready to play at the World Cup tournament. This is especially applicable to individuals who play in the major European leagues and we note a significant contrast between European match schedules and those on other continents. For example, in Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America, match schedules will be interrupted from November 5th, 15 days before the World Cup tournament begins. Similarly, in the Japanese J-League in Asia, Saudi Pro League and Qatar Star League, matches will be interrupted one month before the World Cup tournament begins, leaving more time for players on these continents to prepare. It is also important to note that the French, Spanish and English domestic championships will resume their match schedules on December 27th which is just ten days after the end of the World Cup (Figure 1). Clubs will clearly want their players to return uninjured and with sufficient fitness levels to resume domestic competition but these goals could be compromised by the aforementioned scheduling of the World Cup tournament.",1

This study was underpinned by occupational socialization theory and utilized a qualitative, collective case study design through demographic questionnaires, in-depth face-to-face semistructured interviews, and reflexive thematic analysis. Participants were six current professional soccer players of one professional team of the Women’s Empowerment League. Three themes were generated from the data: (a) avoiding washout effects in second career opportunities, (b) the importance of dual-career pathway opportunities, and (c) professional development and second career training. These findings reflected how participants’ first career as a professional athlete became ingrained within their identity and shaped future desires and preparations for second careers. They also reflect the difficulty participants experienced balancing a professional athletic career with part-time office work for financial stability as well as planning for a second career linked to soccer. Players expressed a need for second career preparation to be facilitated by their clubs and the Women’s Empowerment League, and we provide implications and recommendations to support this work.",1
Effects of Weight-Bearing and Weight-Supporting Sports on Bone Mass in Males,2022-09-01,2022,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Polish Journal of Sport and Tourism,"Barbara Długołęcka, Ewa Jówko","Abstract Introduction. The aim of this work was to assess bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in male athletes performing weight-bearing and weight-supporting sports activities as well as in untrained men. Material and methods. The study included 140 men aged 20-23. The study group consisted of wrestlers, football players, cyclists and untrained men. BMC (g) and BMD (g/cm2) in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) were determined with the use of the DEXA method. Biochemical parameters (concentration of osteocalcin, testosterone and 25-OH vitamin D in blood) were measured using the ELISA method. Diet composition was assessed based on three individual questionnaire interviews regarding nutrition in the last 24 hours prior to the study. Results. Statistical analysis revealed that wrestlers demonstrated the highest levels of parameters related to bone mass. In this group, mean values of BMC, BMD as well as BMD compared to peak populational bone mass were significantly higher than in cyclists and the men from the control group. In the case of BMD (g/cm2), the difference was at the level of p &lt; 0.001, whereas in the remaining parameters, i.e. BMC (g) and BMD with reference to age (%), it was at the level of p &lt; 0.01. No significant differences between the groups were observed in the concentration of osteocalcin, testosterone and 25-OH vitamin D in blood and in nutrition. Conclusions . Athletes who perform sports that predispose to the development of bone pathology should also do exercises that would support bone mineralisation and prevent osteoporosis in the future.",1
EFFECTS OF A SOCCER-SPECIFIC VERTICAL JUMP ON LANDING MECHANICS,2022-09-01,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Henry Wang, Sophia Mancini, D. Clark Dickin, Dorice Hankemeier, Caroline Ashton, Jordan Welch","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury frequently occurs in female soccer athletes during deceleration movements such as landings. The drop vertical jump (DVJ) is often used a screening tool for ACL injury risk factors. Kinematic mechanisms have been linked to ACL injury risk including deficiencies in hip and knee flexion during landing. In soccer, landings mostly occur following jumping headers. Little research has been done to determine the mechanics that follow headers and how they compare to the standard DVJ. PURPOSE: This study analyzed the kinematic differences between landings in female soccer athletes to better assess the risk for ACL injury in soccer-specific vertical jumps (SSVJ). It was hypothesized that more biomechanical tendencies associated with ACL risk factors would emerge from the SSVJ compared to the DVJ across the first and second landings. METHODS: 8 female recreational soccer athletes (20.88 ± 1.17 years; 1.68 ± 0.06 m; 58.77 ± 7.65 kg) performed DVJs and SSVJs initiated from a 31 cm height. Motion capture was performed during landings. Data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, collapsed across jump type (DVJ vs. SSVJ). RESULTS: SSVJs produced less peak hip flexion (67.50 ± 2.55° vs 78.62 ± 3.54°, p = 0.030), and less peak knee flexion (79.15 ± 3.59° vs 88.18 ± 3.95°, p = 0.002) compared to DVJs during landing. SSVJs demonstrated increased ankle plantarflexion at initial contact than DVJ across both landings (20.0 ± 15.66° vs 17.11 ± 17.21°, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: SSVJs displayed a more erect landing posture than the DVJs at the hip and knee, a known ACL risk factor. Increased extension that occurred at the hip and knee in SSVJs compared to DVJs may be linked with the increased ankle plantarflexion at initial contact. The significant results between jump styles shows that the DVJ displays mechanics that are different from the SSVJ. The SSVJ may be a better sport-specific screening tool for ACL injury mechanisms than the DVJ in soccer athletes as it has more direct translation to the sport.Supported by BSU ASPiRE Grant 2020",1
Impact Of Limb And Total Body Composition On Drop Vertical Jump Landing Kinematics,2022-09-01,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Isaac Bryan Shaw, Malia N. Blue, Brett S. Pexa, Audrey E. Westbrook, Kevin R. Ford, Jeffrey B. Taylor, Christopher D. Johnston","Lower limbs containing elevated levels of adipose tissue exhibit diminished quadricep strength and power. Deficits in quadriceps function negatively influence sagittal knee mechanics during drop vertical jumping (DVJ) maneuvers. It is poorly understood how measures of limb and systemic composition impact landing performance and injury risk. PURPOSE: Determine the relationship between composition and sagittal knee kinematics during landing from a DVJ. METHODS: Thirty-six female (171.0 ± 7.6 cm; 66.5 ± 7.6 kg; 22.7 ± 1.8BMI) collegiate volleyball and soccer athletes participated in this study. Biomechanical variables of interest include sagittal knee angle (KA) obtained at two different points during landing using 3-dimensional marker-less motion capture during DVJ maneuvers. These two points were initial contact (IC) and the ending of the landing phase, defined where the center of gravity was at its lowest point (MIN). Higher negative sagittal angle values are indicative of greater knee flexion. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to compute total body fat percentage (BF%) and bilateral limb lean mass (LLM). LLM was normalized to the total mass of the limb. Associations between landing biomechanics and compositional measures were analyzed via Pearson Product Moment correlations. RESULTS: KA at MIN in the left (-92.8 ± 8.9°) and right leg (-92.4 ± 9.5°) were associated with BF% (27.5 ± 4.3%) (Right: r = 0.430, p = 0.009; Left: r = 0.432, p = 0.008) and LLM (Right: 64.3 ± 4.3% limb mass; Left: 64.0 ± 4.6% limb mass) (Right: r = -0.416, p = 0.012; Left: r = -0.410, p = 0.013). At IC, right leg (-23.7 ± 8.4°) KA had a weak relationship to BF% (r = 0.390, p = 0.019) and LLM (r = -0.364, p = 0.029). Relationships between KA at IC in the left leg (-26.5 ± 8.3°) and BF% (r = 0.289, p = 0.088) and LLM (r = -0.311, p = 0.065) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between BF% and LLM and sagittal KA during DVJ landing indicate that greater LLM and lower BF% may be better for injury risk and performance. Lesser knee flexion range of motion during landing may be caused by inhibited capacity to attenuate landing forces during sport performance. Greater adipose tissue within the limb and systemically may negatively influence injury risk by reducing the ability to adequately absorb forces when landing during an athletic task.",1
Influence Of Blood Biomarkers Levels On The External Load Performance During An Elite Soccer Microcycle,2022-09-01,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Daniel Rojas-Valverde, Erick Sánchez-Alvarado, Braulio Sanchez-Urena, Randall Gutiérrez-Vargas, Jose Pino-Ortega, Jose M.

Understanding the manner which blood biomarkers as internal load variables could impact external load indicators of physical performance can improve how coaches plan and prescribe physical loads in soccer. This research aimed to analyze the relationship between blood biomarkers levels on external load in professional soccer players during a microcycle of preparation for an international 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match. METHODS: Twenty-four professional soccer players took part in the study (heigh 1.8 ± 0.1 m, weight 75.9 ± 3.1 kg, age 27.4 ± 3.4 years). Lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, IU/L), and creatine kinase (CK, IU/L) blood levels were measured at the beginning of a 9-day microcycle. A total of seven training sessions and two international official qualifying matches (days 7 and 9) were monitored using inertial measurement devices. The following external load variables were extracted for analysis: distance (m/min), accelerations [n/min], decelerations (n/min), and player load (a.u.). Correlation coefficients (r), were calculated to analyze the association between internal and external variables throughout the microcycle. RESULTS: Before the beginning of the microcycle, eight players showed lymphocytes and LDH levels above normal reference values. Also, nine players demonstrated CK levels above 200 UI/L. Levels of lymphocytes correlated with accelerations (r = 0.59; p = 0.03) and deceleration (r = 0.9; p < 0.01) on days 8 and 9 respectively. Also, LDH levels correlated with decelerations on day 9 (r = 0.9; p < 0.01). Finally, CK levels correlated with accelerations on the first match day. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high physical load that professional players accumulate in their respective clubs, as evidenced by elevated lymphocyte, LDH, and CK values, may be present even before the official call-up with their national teams. Coaching staffs should consider this when planning and prescribing loads before international matches, understanding that the internal load can influence the external load and performance.",1
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction And Alterations In Biomechanical Landing-stability And Decision-making Quality During Unanticipated Jump-landings,2022-09-01,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Evans Yayra Kwaku Ashigbi, Florian Giesche, Daniel Niederer, Lena Weßler, David Friebe, David A. Groneberg, Winfried Banzer","In team sports such as football, athletes are often required to adapt their motor plans in response to unpredictable/unanticipated visual information on the playing field under time pressure. These unanticipated movements lead to high-risk knee mechanics (landing safety decrements) which elevates injury/re-injury risk compared to pre-planned tasks. PURPOSE: To compare the magnititude of landing safety decrements ('unanticipated-landing costs') in athletes with and without a history of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: Matched-paired cross-sectional data from 14 ACL-reconstructed (females: n = 6, mean age: 23 ± 5 SD, BMI: 23 ± 4 Kg/m2, Tegner activity score (TAS): 8 ± 1; time since surgery: <2 years) and 14 healthy individuals (females: n = 6, mean age: 26 ± 3, BMI: 22 ± 2 Kg/m2, TAS: 8 ± 2) were analyzed. Participants performed countermovement-jumps with pre-planned or unanticipated single-leg landings on force plates. Landing kinetics (peak vertical ground reaction forces; pGRF), postural landing stability (center of pressure, time to stabilization), and decision-making quality (number of landings on wrong foot) were assessed. RESULTS: In both groups, the unanticipated condition resulted in significantly higher pGRF (ACL: 52 ± 4 vs. 56 ± 5 N/Kg, p = 0.004; Controls: 55 ± 7 vs. 59 ± 5 N/Kg, p = 0.021) and decision errors (ACL: 0 ± 0 vs. 3.2 ± 2, p = 0.001; Controls: 0 ± 0 vs. 2.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.003) compared to the pre-planned condition. The magnitude of unanticipated-landing costs did not differ significantly between groups (p > 0.05) for all the outcomes assessed. CONCLUSION: Unanticipated-landing costs occurred in both groups, but their magnitude was not significantly higher in the ACL-reconstructed group. To further elucidate the ACL-injury/re-injury risk associated with unanticipated movements, future biomechanical studies measuring joint kinetics and kinematics are warranted.",1
Return to Sport Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Women's Soccer,2022-08-30,2022,Journal of Women's Sports Medicine,Journal of Women's Sports Medicine,Lenore Herget,"Soccer is largely recognized as the most popular sport in the world. It involves speed, agility and endurance, requiring its athletes to sprint, explode to the ball, change direction and maintain high thresholds of work for prolonged periods. In the United States, as many as 80,000 high school female athletes experience ACL injuries each year. Females tend to be more at risk for ACL injury for a multitude of reasons including biomechanical, neuromuscular activation patterns, strength imbalances and hormonal factors. Athletes and their families are becoming increasingly aware of this risk and the subsequent risk of not returning to their pre-injury level of play; thus, necessitating both preventative and post injury rehabilitation programs aimed at maximizing function and minimizing subsequent injury. A program that focuses on neuromuscular activation patterns, proprioception and balance training, functional strength, agility, landing techniques and quality of footwork is best for mitigating risk of ACL injuries in female soccer players. This post-surgical ACL reconstruction rehabilitation program for the female soccer player has been divided into five phases, each phase a progression and building upon its preceding phase. The phases range from early post-operative care to late stage, pre-clearance to return to sport guidance and have been constructed based on evidence informed guidelines focusing on maximizing function post operatively in a safe, efficient manner while minimizing risk for re-injury.",1
Playing Surface and Injury Risk: Artificial Turf Vs. Natural Grass,2022-08-27,2022,IntechOpen,Injuries and Sports Medicine,"Griffith G. Gosnell, Brett A. Gerber, Gregory P. Guyton, Heath P. Gould","Artificial turf’s developmental history spans 6 generations and includes design improvements that transformed an injury-inducing 1st generation field into a modern 3rd generation natural grass substitute. Artificial turf has become a widely adopted playing surface with a $2.7 billion United States Dollar (USD) valuation in North America. Turf’s popularity is due to its increased functionality and decreased cost compared to natural grass that allows more sports to play on the surface for longer time periods with decreased maintenance costs. From a biomechanical perspective, artificial turf exhibits higher frictional coefficients than natural grass resulting in higher foot and ankle injury rates. Concussion rates on turf are decreased compared to natural grass due to lower G-max values on well-maintained artificial surfaces. Hip, knee, and overall injury rates are equivalent between the two surfaces except in specific populations including elite-level American football players that exhibit increased knee injury rates on artificial turf. Due to these tradeoffs, the authors suggest that athletic organizations with funding to support professional groundskeeping should consider investing in natural grass due to athlete preference and decreased injury risk. In contrast, organizations without sufficient funding for professional groundskeeping operations may consider investing in modern artificial turf due to its associated long-term benefits and decreased costs.",1
Aerodynamic Analysis and Training Research of an S-Shaped Arc Ball Based on Hydrodynamics,2022-08-25,2022,Wiley,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,Pinxin Si,"The aerodynamic characteristics of S-shaped arc ball, such as poor combat performance and low intelligence, are studied and analyzed. In this paper, the aerodynamic analysis model of S-shaped arc soccer intelligent algorithm is established, and the dynamic tracking model of Soccer Tactics Based on fluid dynamics search algorithm is designed. The data information is collected from many aspects, such as the position of the players, the change of the arc ball movement, the trajectory of the football movement, and tactical flexibility. The results show that Benn's algorithm can start the layout mechanism effectively. It has high feasibility and accurate algorithm accuracy and can effectively improve the aerodynamic layout performance of the system.

Breaking new grounds in injury risk screening in soccer by deploying unsupervised learning with a special focus on sex and fatigue effects,2022-08-24,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Gerda Strutzenberger, Sina David, Lana Mei Borcard, Stefan Fröhlich, Florian, B. Imhoff, Johannes Scherr, Jörg Spörri","In injury prevention, a vertical drop jump (DJ) is often used for screening athletes at risk for injury; however, the large variation in individual movement patterns might mask potentially relevant strategies when analysed on a group-based level. Two movement strategies are commonly discussed as predisposing athletes to ACL injuries: a deficient leg axis and increased leg stiffness during landing. This study investigated the individual movement pattern of 39 female and male competitive soccer players performing DJs at rest and after being fatigued. The joint angles were used to train a Kohonen self-organising map. Out of 19,596 input vectors, the SOM identified 700 unique postures. Visualising the movement trajectories and adding the latent parameters contact time, medial knee displacement (MKD) and knee abduction moment allow identification of zones with presumably increased injury risk and whether the individual movement patterns pass these zones. This information can be used, e.g., for individual screening and for feedback purposes. Additionally, an athlete's reaction to fatigue can be explored by comparing the rested and fatigued movement trajectories. The results highlight the ability of unsupervised learning to visualise movement patterns and to give further insight into an individual athlete's status without the necessity of a priori assumptions.",1

Prehabilitation, rehabilitation, surgical and psychological aspects play an essential role in the decision to return to sports.The purpose of this study is to reach an international consensus about the best conditions for returning to sports in soccer—one of the most demanding level I pivoting sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.Methods34 International experts in the management of ACL injuries, representing all the Continents were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method to achieve a consensus. 37 statements related to ACL reconstruction were reviewed by the experts in three rounds of surveys in complete anonymity. The statements were prepared by the working group based on previous literature or systematic reviews. Rating agreement through a Likert Scale: strongly agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree and strongly disagree was used. To define consensus, it was established that the assertions should achieve a 75% of agreement or disagreement.ResultsOf the 37 statements, 10 achieved unanimous consensus, 18 non-unanimous consensus and 9 did not achieve consensus. In the preoperative, the correction of the range of motion deficit, the previous high level of participation in sports and a better knowledge of the injury by the patient and compliance to participate in Rehabilitation were the statements that reached unanimous consensus. During the surgery, the treatment of associated injuries, as well as the use of autografts, and the addition of a lateral extra-articular tenodesis in some particular cases (active young athletes, <25 years old, hyperlaxity, high rotatory laxity and revision cases) obtained also 100% consensus.In the postoperative period, psychological readiness and its validation with scales, adequate physical preparation, as well as not basing the RTSS purely on the time of evolution after surgery, were the factors that reached unanimous Consensus.ConclusionsThe consensus statements derived from this international ISAKOS leaders, may assist clinicians in deciding when to return to sports soccer in patients after an ACL reconstruction. Those statements that reached 100% consensus have to be strongly considered in the final decision to RTS soccer.",1
Acute Obturator Externus Injury in Professional Soccer Players: A Case Series,2022-08-23,2022,MDPI AG,Medicina,"Hye Chang Rhim, Ashley E. Gureck, Ki-Mo Jang","When patients present with hip or groin pain, proximal quadriceps or adductor injuries are often initially suspected. In this case report, however, we present three cases of professional soccer players who were found to have obturator externus injury. A 30-year-old player and a 24-year-old player complained of pain in the left side after long distance shooting during an in-season training session and a match, respectively. Another 24-year-old player complained of pain in the right side after long distance passing during a preseason training session. On physical examination, active hip external rotation and passive hip internal rotation and extension elicited pain in all three players. All three players underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which found obturator externus grade II injuries for two players and grade I injury for one player. Rehabilitation protocols included relative rest, cryotherapy, and electrotherapy over a period of one week. All patients were able to return to play after 10 days. Correct identification of obturator externus injury afforded our players a favorable prognosis and a relatively quick return-to-sport compared with quadricep or adductor injury.",1
Biomechanical invasive reconstruction of the distal oblique band of the interosseous membrane with extensor carpi radialis longus in radioulnar instability: A new clinical therapy for athletes,2022-08-23,2022,Open Source Publications,Journal of Clinical Images and Medical Case Reports,"Alberto Gimenez Ros, Vicente J Leon Munoz, Fernando Santonja Medina, Jose Luis Calvo Guirado, Francisco Martinez Martinez","Distal Radioulnar Joint (DRUJ) instability is a pathology without a clear reconstructive procedure. Throughout history, numerous techniques have been described whose objectives have been to increase stability as well as relieve pain. The main stabilizing element is the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) and, there are also secondary stabilizers among where the Distal Oblique Bundle (DOB) is consistently located. We performed a biomechanical study with three cadaveric arms to verify the influence of DOB on joint stability and performing a new reconstruction technique with hemi tendon of carpi radialis longus extensor to get distal radio cubital stability for fiber cartilage repair. There are positive results in the volar and dorsal displacement of the ulna on the radius with the reconstruction technique presented to restore joint stability. The proposed technique is a valid and biomechanically effective option to restore joint stability as a complement to the repair of the TFCC or as a unique technique if the TFCC is irreparable. This technique became important when you cannot repair TFCC in athletes, the recommended alternative can be done and distal oblique soft plasty.",1

Artistic swimmers did not show significant differences in any parameter analyzed for 3D-DXA when compared to sedentary controls. The 3D-DXA modeling revealed statistical differences in cortical thickness and vBMD between female athletes engaged in weight-bearing (football) and non-weight bearing (swimming) sports and did not show differences between the non-weight bearing sport and the sedentary controls. 3D-DXA modeling could provide insight into bone remodeling in the sports field, allowing evaluation of femoral trabecular and cortical strength from standard DXA scans.",1
Predicting ACL Injury Using Machine Learning on Data From an Extensive Screening Test Battery of 880 Female Elite Athletes,2022-08-19,2022,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Susanne Jauhiainen, Jukka-Pekka Kauppi, Tron Krosshaug, Roald Bahr, Julia Bartsch, Sami Äyrämö","Background: Injury risk prediction is an emerging field in which more research is needed to recognize the best practices for accurate injury risk assessment. Important issues related to predictive machine learning need to be considered, for example, to avoid overinterpreting the observed prediction performance. Purpose: To carefully investigate the predictive potential of multiple predictive machine learning methods on a large set of risk factor data for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury; the proposed approach takes into account the effect of chance and random variations in prediction performance. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The authors used 3-dimensional motion analysis and physical data collected from 791 female elite handball and soccer players. Four common classifiers were used to predict ACL injuries (n = 60). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) averaged across 100 cross-validation runs (mean AUC-ROC) was used as a performance metric. Results were confirmed with repeated permutation tests (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank-test; P &lt; .05). Additionally, the effect of the most common class imbalance handling techniques was evaluated. Results: For the best classifier (linear support vector machine), the mean AUC-ROC was 0.63. Regardless of the classifier, the results were significantly better than chance, confirming the predictive ability of the data and methods used. AUC-ROC values varied substantially across repetitions and methods (0.51-0.69). Class imbalance handling did not improve the results. Conclusion: The authors’ approach and data showed statistically significant predictive ability, indicating that there exists information in this prospective data set that may be valuable for understanding injury causation. However, the predictive ability remained low from the perspective of clinical assessment, suggesting that included variables cannot be used for ACL prediction in practice.",1
Exercise-induced modulation of myokine irisin in bone and cartilage tissue—Positive effects on osteoarthritis: A narrative review,2022-08-19,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,"Ke Ning, Zhuo Wang, Xin-an Zhang","Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative musculoskeletal disease characterized by pathological changes in joint structures along with the incidence of which increases with age. Exercise is recommended for all clinical treatment guidelines of osteoarthritis, but the exact molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Irisin is a newly discovered myokine released mainly by skeletal muscle in recent years—a biologically active protein capable of being released into the bloodstream as an endocrine factor, the synthesis and secretion of which is specifically induced by exercise-induced muscle contraction. Although the discovery of irisin is relatively recent, its role in affecting bone density and cartilage homeostasis has been reported. Here, we review the production and structural characteristics of irisin and discuss the effects of the different types of exercise involved in the current study on irisin and the role of irisin in anti-aging. In addition, the role of irisin in the regulation of bone mineral density, bone metabolism, and its role in chondrocyte homeostasis and metabolism is reviewed. A series of studies on irisin have provided new insights into the mechanisms of exercise training in improving bone density, resisting cartilage degeneration, and maintaining the overall environmental homeostasis of the joint. These studies further contribute to the understanding of the role of exercise in the fight against osteoarthritis and will provide an important reference and aid in the development of the field of osteoarthritis prevention and treatment.",1
Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Freddie Fu's paradigm,2022-08-19,2022,Elsevier BV,Journal of ISAKOS,"Michael A. Fox, Ian D. Engler, Balint T. Zsidai, Jonathan D. Hughes, Volker Musahl","<h2>Abstract</h2> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction techniques have evolved over the past four decades. There is evidence that non-anatomic reconstruction techniques, such as traditional transtibial drilling, fail to recreate the native anatomy of the ACL, which can lead to increased rotatory knee instability, revision risk, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Anatomic ACL reconstruction has emerged as the gold standard, with the goal of restoring the patient's native anatomy and knee kinematics. This review will summarise the relevant anatomy, modern anatomic ACL reconstruction techniques, and literature supporting anatomic ACL reconstruction as the new paradigm. <h3>Level of evidence</h3> Level V, review article.",1
Motion Analysis of Football Kick Based on an IMU Sensor,2022-08-19,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Chun Yu, Ting-Yuan Huang, Hsi-Pin Ma","A greater variety of technologies are being applied in sports and health with the advancement of technology, but most optoelectronic systems have strict environmental restrictions and are usually costly. To visualize and perform quantitative analysis on the football kick, we introduce a 3D motion analysis system based on a six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) to reconstruct the motion trajectory, in the meantime analyzing the velocity and the highest point of the foot during the backswing. We build a signal processing system in MATLAB and standardize the experimental process, allowing users to reconstruct the foot trajectory and obtain information about the motion within a short time. This paper presents a system that directly analyzes the instep kicking motion rather than recognizing different motions or obtaining biomechanical parameters. For the instep kicking motion of path length around 3.63 m, the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 0.07 m. The RMSE of the foot velocity is 0.034 m/s, which is around 0.45% of the maximum velocity. For the maximum velocity of the foot and the highest point of the backswing, the error is approximately 4% and 2.8%, respectively. With less complex hardware, our experimental results achieve excellent velocity accuracy.",1

Design Prospective experimental multimodal (clinical, biomechanical, biological) data collection under walking stress and three different load conditions varied in a randomized crossover design. Experimental protocol At baseline, equal numbers of healthy and anterior cruciate ligament injured participants aged 20–30 or 40–60 years will be assessed clinically and complete questionnaires regarding their knee health. Biomechanical parameters (joint kinetics, joint kinematics, and surface electromyography) will be recorded while performing different tasks including overground and treadmill walking, single leg balance and hopping tasks. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of both of knees will be obtained. On separate stress test days, participants will perform a 30-minute walking stress with either reduced (80% body weight (BW)), normal (100%BW) or increased (120%BW) load. Serum blood samples will be taken immediately before, immediately after, 30, 120 and 210 minutes after the walking stress. Concentration of articular cartilage blood biomarkers will be assessed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. At 24-month follow-up, participants will be again assessed clinically, undergo an MRI, complete questionnaires, and have a blood sample taken. Conclusion The study design provides a standardized set up that allows to better understand the influence of ambulatory load on articular cartilage biomarkers and thereby extend current knowledge on in vivo cartilage metabolism and mechanosensitivity. Further, this study will help to elucidate the prognostic value of the load-induced cartilage biomarker response for early articular cartilage degeneration.

A multi-club analysis of the locomotor training characteristics of elite female soccer players,2022-08-18,2022,Informa UK Limited,Science and Medicine in Football,"Naomi Myhill, Dan Weaving, Steve Barrett, Ryan King, Stacey Emmonds","Quantifying differences in locomotor characteristics of training between two competition levels and between training days within elite female soccer players.Foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (Playermaker) data were collected from 293 players from three Women's Super League (WSL; n = 76) and eight Women's Championship (WC; n = 217) teams over a 28-week period. Data were analysed using partial least squares correlation analysis to identify relative variable importance and linear mixed effects models to identify magnitude of effects.WSL players performed more high-speed running distance (HSR; >5.29 m∙s-1), sprint distance (SpD; >6.26 m∙s-1), acceleration (ACC; >3 m∙s-2) and deceleration (DEC; <-3 m∙s-2) distance than WC players. The largest difference between WSL and WC in HSR and HSR per minute occurred on MD-4, (354.7 vs. 190.29 m and 2.8 vs. 1.7 m∙min-1). On MD-2, WSL players also covered greater SpD (44.66 vs. 12.42 m), SpD per minute (0.38 vs. 0.11 m∙min-1) and HSR per minute (1.67 vs. 0.93 m∙min-1). Between training days both WSL and WC teams reduced HSR and SpD but not ACC and DEC distance from MD-4 to MD-2, with MD-4 the highest training day of the week.MD-4 is a key training day discriminating between competitive level. HSR and SpD volume and intensity is tapered in WSL and WC players, however there is less clear taper of ACC or DEC. As such, WC teams could increase the volume and intensity of HSR on MD-4 to mimic locomotor activities of those at a higher standard.",1

Baker, Yaodong Gu","This study investigates the symmetry change in joint angle and joint moment of knee joints following a Running-Induced Fatigue counter movement Jump. Twelve amateur runners volunteered to participate in the study. A prolonged running protocol was used to induce fatigue. Joint angle and moment were recorded during the push and flexion phase of the CMJ before and immediately after fatigue. Borg scale (RPE&amp;gt;17) and real-time heart rate monitoring (HR&amp;gt;90%HRmax) were used to confirm running fatigue. Symmetry function (SF) was used to assess the symmetry of the knee Angle and moment variation parameters over the entire push-off and landing phases based on time series analysis. Paired sample t -test was used to examine changes in SF before and after acute fatigue. The Angle and moment of the knee are asymmetrical in all planes (SF &amp;gt; 0.05), with SF ranging from 5 to 130% in angle and 5–110% in moment. There was a significant increase in knee joint angle asymmetry in the horizontal plane during the push-off and landing stage following the prolonged - Running Protocol implementation. These increases in asymmetry are mainly caused by excessive external rotation of the dominant knee joint. These findings indicate that fatigue-induced changes during CMJ may progress knee movement pattern asymmetry in the horizontal plane.",1
Optical Microscope Rehabilitation Nursing Study of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury through Lateral Knee Incision Based on Medical Internet of Things,2022-08-16,2022,Wiley,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,"Liping Liu, Nan Chang, Shihong Li, Peipei Gong, Junhua Wang","With the high development of sports, football has attracted more and more attention from the public. However, the hot competition has made football players undergo high-intensity training, and the risk of injury caused by training is also increasing. Lateral incision knee ACL injury is one of the most common types of injuries in football players, which has a serious impact on the athlete’s physiology and daily training. The comprehensive, multi-level, convenient and fast medical system brought by the medical Internet of Things has become the growing demand of the medical industry. Based on the medical Internet of Things, this paper studies the rehabilitation nursing of football players’ ACL injury by lateral cutting and running combined with optical microscope. In this paper, 36 male and female football players were selected for group experiments, and the landing and peak torque indexes of the experimental group and the control group of male and female athletes were analyzed under the observation of an optical microscope. Group (P &lt;0.05), coxa valgus (P &lt;0.01), internal rotation and knee valgus angles were greater than those in the EM group. And the peak hip flexion angle and knee valgus moment in NF group were lower than those in EF group (P &lt;0.05). After 12 weeks of rehabilitation training, there was a significant difference in the Q/H joint contraction index between the REF group and the CON group (P &lt;0.05), and there was no statistical difference in the other groups. After 12 weeks of rehabilitation training, there was a significant difference in the Q/H joint contraction index between the REF group and the CON group (P &lt;0.05), and there was no statistical difference in the other groups. That is to say, after the systematic rehabilitation training proposed in this paper, the joint contraction performance of the hamstrings/quadriceps in the REF group has been significantly improved. This shows that the rehabilitation nursing under the optical microscope based on the medical Internet of Things has a good effect on the rehabilitation of the football player’s side-cut running knee joint ACL injury.",1

Recent advances in sensor technology have improved our understanding of head kinematics during on-field activities; however, proper utilization and interpretation of data from wearable devices requires careful implementation of best practices. The objective of this paper is to summarize minimum requirements and best practices for on-field deployment of wearable devices for the measurement of head acceleration events in vivo to ensure data evaluated are representative of real events and limitations are accurately defined. Best practices covered in this document include the definition of a verified head acceleration event, data windowing, video verification, advanced post-processing techniques, and on-field logistics, as determined through review of the literature and expert opinion. Careful use of best practices, with accurate acknowledgement of limitations, will allow research teams to ensure data evaluated is representative of real events, will improve the robustness of head acceleration event exposure studies, and generally improve the quality and validity of research into head impact injuries.",1
Preliminary brain-behavioral neural correlates of anterior cruciate ligament injury risk landing biomechanics using a novel bilateral leg press neuroimaging paradigm,2022-08-11,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Dustin R. Grooms, Jed A. Diekfuss, Cody R. Criss, Manish Anand, Alexis B. Slutsky-Ganesh, Christopher A. DiCesare, Gregory D. Myer","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk reduction strategies primarily focus on biomechanical factors related to frontal plane knee motion and loading. Although central nervous system processing has emerged as a contributor to injury risk, brain activity associated with the resultant ACL injury-risk biomechanics is limited. Thus, the purposes of this preliminary study were to determine the relationship between bilateral motor control brain activity and injury risk biomechanics and isolate differences in brain activity for those who demonstrate high versus low ACL injury risk. Thirty-one high school female athletes completed a novel, multi-joint leg press during brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize bilateral motor control brain activity. Athletes also completed an established biomechanical assessment of ACL injury risk biomechanics within a 3D motion analysis laboratory. Knee abduction moments during landing were modelled as a covariate of interest within the fMRI analyses to identify directional relationships with brain activity and an injury-risk group classification analysis, based on established knee abduction moment cut-points. Greater landing knee abduction moments were associated with greater lingual gyrus, intracalcarine cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus activity when performing the bilateral leg press (all z > 3.1, p < .05; multiple comparison corrected). In the follow-up injury-risk classification analysis, those classified as high ACL injury-risk had greater activity in the lingual gyrus, parietal cortex and bilateral primary and secondary motor cortices relative to those classified as low ACL injury-risk (all z > 3.1, p < .05; multiple comparison corrected). In young female athletes, elevated brain activity for bilateral leg motor control in regions that integrate sensory, spatial, and attentional information were related to ACL injury-risk landing biomechanics. These data implicate crossmodal visual and proprioceptive integration brain activity and knee spatial awareness as potential neurotherapeutic targets to optimize ACL injury-risk reduction strategies.",1

The participants comprised of 12 forwards, 6 midfielders, 4 goalkeepers and 7 defenders. The weight, height, waist circumference, and hip circumference measurements were obtained using standardised procedures. The body mass index and waist to hip ratio scores of the participants were calculated. The alternate hand wall toss test was used to determine the hand-eye coordination of the participants. Pearson’s product moment correlation and linear regression were used to analyse the results. The level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. A significant negative strong correlation was observed between waist to hip ratio and coordination among midfielders (r = -0.841, p = 0.036). There was no significant correlation between waist to hip ratio and coordination among forwards, defenders, and goalkeepers. In addition, there was no significant correlation between body mass index and coordination as well as waist circumference and coordination among football players in all the playing positions. Waist to hip ratio is an important anthropometric measure that can affect the coordination of midfielders in a football team. This should be considered by the coaches and football regulatory bodies before players are assigned to playing positions in the game of football. Position-specific training programmes should be encouraged to enhance football players' performance.",1
The Effect of the FIFA 11+ on Injury Prevention and Performance in Football: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,2022-08-10,2022,MDPI AG,BioMed,"Theodosis Vlachas, Eleftherios Paraskevopoulos","Football is characterized as a contact sport that increases the risk of injury. For the reduction of injuries, health care providers created a warm-up program that is called the FIFA11+. This is a 20 min warm-up program that has the goal of preventing injuries. This literature review investigated the effects of FIFA11+ on injury prevention and performance in football players. A systematic search was performed in three scientific databases (Pubmed, Scopus, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro)) and one search engine (Google Scholar) from inception to June 2022. Relevant studies published in the English language were extracted, evaluated, and independently rated for methodological quality (PEDro scale). Overall, 10 randomized controlled trials were analyzed and their outcomes are discussed. Through the analysis of the studies, it was observed that the groups which performed the FIFA 11+ warm-up program had fewer incidents of injuries. In addition, the athletes of these groups increased their performance, especially in balance, proprioception, and strength of hamstrings. After the analysis, the results and limitations of the randomized controlled trials are discussed. Finally, this review suggests the inclusion of the FIFA 11+ in training sessions, and future recommendations are provided for the next trials for the maximization of their reliability.",1
"Analysis of vertical jump, rating of perceived exertion, delayed-onset muscle soreness, and muscular peak power in young male Brazilian football players submitted to plyometric and semi-squat training with weights",2022-08-09,2022,JURUFRA SL,Retos,"Renato Tavares Fonseca, Gustavo Casimiro Lopes, Juliana Brandão Pinto de Castro, Luciano Alonso Valente dos Santos, Bruno Lucas Pinheiro Lima, Gilson Ramos de Oliveira Filho, Rodolfo de Alkmim Moreira Nunes, Rodrigo Gomes de Souza Vale","This study analyzed the effects of plyometric and strength training on vertical jump (VJ), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and absolute (APP) and relative (RPP) muscle peak power in young male football players.

Grizzlies and gazelles: Duty factor is an effective measure for categorizing running style in English Premier League soccer players,2022-08-09,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Brian Hanley, Catherine B. Tucker, Liam Gallagher, Parag Parelkar, Liam Thomas, Rubén Crespo, Rob J. Price","English Premier League soccer players run at multiple speeds throughout a game. The aim of this study was to assess how well the duty factor, a dimensionless ratio based on temporal variables, described running styles in professional soccer players. A total of 25 players ran on an instrumented treadmill at 12, 16, and 20 km/h. Spatiotemporal and ground reaction force data were recorded for 30 s at each speed; video data (500 Hz) were collected to determine footstrike patterns. In addition to correlation analysis amongst the 25 players, two groups (both N = 9) of high and low duty factors were compared. The duty factor was negatively correlated with peak vertical force, center of mass (CM) vertical displacement, and leg stiffness (kleg) at all speeds (r ≥ -0.51, p ≤ 0.009). The low duty factor group had shorter contact times, longer flight times, higher peak vertical forces, greater CM vertical displacement, and higher kleg (p < 0.01). Among the high DF group players, eight were rearfoot strikers at all speeds, compared with three in the low group. The duty factor is an effective measure for categorizing soccer players as being on a continuum from terrestrial (high duty factor) to aerial (low duty factor) running styles, which we metaphorically refer to as ""grizzlies"" and ""gazelles,"" respectively. Because the duty factor distinguishes running style, there are implications for the training regimens of grizzlies and gazelles in soccer, and exercises to improve performance should be developed based on the biomechanical advantages of each spontaneous running style.",1
League 3 of Indonesia Bali Zone: Shots and patterns of scoring a goal,2022-08-08,2022,UIR Press,Journal Sport Area,"Ketut Chandra Adinata Kusuma Chandra, I Wayan Artanayasa, Hendra Mashuri","An indicator of a success football team in a match is to score more goals than its opponents. Continuous and stable victories can be achieved by applying sports science and technology, one of them in this case is analyzing team performance. The purpose of this study is to describe the pattern of shots taken and goals scored during League 3 of Indonesia Bali Zone in 2021. The research method chosen for this study is descriptive quantitative research. A total of 38 matches are observed to see the number of shots and goals scoring patterns based on time intervals (15 minutes), type of play, number of passes before shot and goal scoring, player action before shooting and goal scoring, playing zone and player position in play. The result of this study indicates that 52.9% of shots occurred in the first half and 51.8% of goals are scored in the second half. Shots (78%) and goals (77%) occurred through the open play process. 61.2% of shots and 64.7% of goal scoring come from the lowest number of passes (0-4 passes). In the central ultra-offensive zone, there are 43.7% shots and 71.2% goal scoring. Based on the playing position, the midfielder recorded the number of shots 34.5% and the striker got 39.6% in scoring goals. The findings of this study can provide information for coaches in seeing the scoring pattern of all teams playing in the Indonesia League 3 Bali Zone. Therefore, it has implications for the way the coach prepares a tactical training program that focuses on how to goal scoring. The limitation of this study is that it has not identified the part of the goal area that produces score. It is important further to examine the part of the goal area where the ball is often conceded or scored by the opponent.",1

Usually, cohort studies analyse only one team with a relatively small sample size, which brings forth the need for a systematic review to generalise training and match intensity evidence. Objectives This review aimed to identify and summarise studies that have examined external and internal training or match intensity monitoring to provide range values for the main measures in female soccer players. Methods A systematic review of EBSCO, PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results From the 2853 studies searched, 44 were analysed in which the following range intervals were found for training: rated perceived exertion (RPE, 1–7 AU), session-RPE (s-RPE, 51–721 AU), total distance (2347–6646 m) and distance &gt;19.4 km·h −1 (9–543 m). For matches, the range values were s-RPE (240–893 AU), total distance (5480–10581 m), distance ≥14 km·h −1 (543–2520 m), ≥ 18 km·h −1 (96–1680 m), number of accelerations (49–240) and deceleration (21–85) and player load (848–1096 AU).

What are the significant turning demands of match play of an English Premier League soccer team?,2022-08-03,2022,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Thomas Dos’Santos, Ian Cowling, Matthew Challoner, Timothy Barry, Paul Caldbeck","This study aimed to compare the significant turning demands of English Premier League soccer match play relative to playing position using LiDAR technology. Turning data were collected from an English Premier League soccer team (2020-2021 season; 18 fixtures) using a Sportlight® LiDAR tracking system. Turns were tracked during match play, sub-categorised by entry speed (<3.0, 3.0-5.5, 5.5-7.0 and >7.0 m/s) and turning angle (Low: 20-59°; Medium: 60-119°; High: 120-180°). Turning metric frequencies were compared between playing positions (centre backs, full-backs, central midfielders, wide midfielders, and central forwards). On average, per match, central midfielders performed more total turns (~38 vs ~18-27), turns with entry speeds <3.0 (~15 vs ~7-10) and 3.0-5.5 m/s (~21 vs ~8-15) and low (~4 vs ~1-2), medium (~10 vs ~3-6) and high angled turns (~24 vs ~12-18) compared to all other playing positions (p ≤ 0.001, d = 0.96-2.74). Approximately, 90% of turns during matches were performed with entry speeds <5.5 m/s and ~63-70% were high angled turns. This study provides unique insights into the turning demands of English Premier League soccer matches , which can be used to inform position-specific physical preparation strategies, turning testing battery selection, agility drill construction, and rehabilitation and return to play standards.",1

Lemos, Calvin E. Hwang, Seth L. Sherman, Marc R. Safran, Geoffrey D. Abrams","Background: Both natural grass (NG) and artificial turf (AT) are popular playing surfaces for soccer. Biomechanical studies have found increased frictional forces on AT that may lead to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The increased risk of ACL injury during soccer in female participants may amplify this effect. Purpose: To systematically review the literature for studies comparing ACL injury risk in soccer players on AT versus NG and to specifically determine whether there were differences in injury risk in male versus female players when considering the playing surface. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A systematic review was performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Three databases were searched for studies with evidence level 1 to 3 that compared the incidence of ACL injuries on AT versus NG in soccer players. Data recorded included study characteristics, sex, competition level, exposure setting (games or practices), turf type, and ACL injury information. Study methodological quality was analyzed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) score, and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Results: Included were 7 articles (3 studying professional soccer, 3 collegiate soccer, 1 youth-level soccer; 4 male cohorts, 2 female cohorts, and 1 male and female cohort; mean MINORS score, 20 ± 0.8). Pooled ACL injury IRRs demonstrated no significant differences in overall ACL injury risk when playing soccer on AT compared with NG (IRR = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.21-1.53]; P = .31). A significantly increased risk of ACL injury in games played on AT compared with NG was detected for female (IRR = 1.18 [95% CI, 1.05-1.31]; P = .004) but not for male players (IRR = 1.18 [95% CI, 0.97-1.42]; P = .09). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in injury risk for games (IRR = 1.07 [95% CI, 0.97-1.18]; P = .20) or practices (IRR = 0.21 [95% CI, 0.04-1.23]; P = .09). Conclusion: Findings indicated that female soccer players had a significantly higher risk of ACL injury when playing games on AT versus NG, whereas no significant difference was seen in male players. No differences were found for the combined male/female cohort or for soccer games or training sessions played on AT compared with NG.",1

External monitoring of matches is useful in establishing the physiological requirements of the sport and assessing how a player compares to the requirements of the event in this regard. This study aimed to analyze the trend component of running performance during a game of professional soccer in Montenegro. The research included a sample of 82 professional soccer players. The first subsample included 44 professional soccer players of the club Budućnost from Podgorica, height 185.89 ± 6.29 cm, mass 81.06 ± 5.47 kg, BMI 23.47 ± 0.96 kg/m 2 , age 28.86 ± 3.85 yrs. The second subsample included 38 professional soccer players from the Sutjeska club from Nikšić, height 181.88 ± 6.35 cm, mass 77.28 ± 6.78 kg, BMI 23.32 ± 1.08 kg/m 2 , age 29.43 ± 5.68 yrs. The InStat kinematic system captured the outfield players by using six cameras placed around the perimeter of the field at the minimal height of 12 m. The frame frequency was 25 frames per second; data were centralized for further analysis. Statistically significant differences were noted only in the variable sprint distance in the 2017 season. The results of the current research indicate that the soccer players who compete in Montenegro are below the values achieved by those who compete in Europe.",1
Does transforming subjective measures of load better represent training and match-play intensity in youth soccer players?,2022-08-01,2022,SAGE Publications,International Journal of Sports Science &amp; Coaching,"Patrick C Maughan, Niall G MacFarlane, Chris Towlson, Steve Barrett, Paul A Swinton","The purpose of this study was to investigate the structure of relationships between measures of training load and assess whether these can be modified through non-linear transformations. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and seven external load measures (total distance covered, PlayerLoad, low-intensity running distance, high-speed running distance, sprinting distance, accelerations, and decelerations) were collected from 20 academy soccer players (age = 17.4 ± 1.3 years, stature = 178.0 ± 8.1 cm, body-mass = 71.8 ± 7.2 kg), with 3220 recordings taken across a 47-week season. To control for the effects of session duration, sessions were categorised as short (≤60 min) or long (&gt;60 min). All RPE and sessional RPE-training load (sRPE-TL; RPE multiplied by session duration) were analysed in their raw form and through raising to a series of exponentials. The underlying structure of the data was investigated using principal component analysis. Two components were retained for each analysis and varimax rotation was performed. The first rotated component (RC) was best represented as a measure of volume (RC volume ) with high loadings for RPE and sRPE-TL, whilst the second RC was best represented as a measure of intensity (RC intensity ). Non-linear transformations had little effect on loading of modified measures for long sessions for sRPE-TL (RC volume : 0.87–0.8; RC intensity : 0.27–0.13), and for RPE (RC volume : 0.76–0.79; RC intensity : 0.17–0.10). For short sessions, the loading became more equal between intensity and volume for sRPE-TL (RC volume : 0.88–0.41; RC intensity : 0.32–0.36) and more aligned to intensity (RC intensity : 0.52–0.61) compared with volume (RC volume : 0.44–0.23) for RPE. The present study demonstrates that RPE and sRPE-TL predominantly reflect measures of training volume, however, they can be modified to better reflect intensity for training sessions &lt;60 min in duration.",1
Relationship between speed and explosive power of lower limbs in semi-elite football players,2022-08-01,2022,Masaryk University Press,Studia sportiva,"Tomáš Vencúrik, Jakub Fikar","PURPOSE: This study focuses on the relationship between speed (acceleration, maximum speed, and change of direction speed) and explosive power of lower limbs represented by countermovement jump (CMJ) in semi-elite football players.&#x0D; METHODS: Twenty semi-elite football players (n = 20; 25.1 ± 6.2 years) participated in the study. All participants were assessed using the following 5 tests: countermovement jump (CMJ), 5-0-5 Agility test with dominant lower limb turn and non-dominant lower limb turn, 10-meter linear sprint, 30-meter linear sprint.&#x0D; RESULTS: Pearson’s correlations (p ≤ 0.05) calculated the relationship between CMJ and speed tests. Subjects displayed a very large correlation between 10 and 30-meter sprints and CMJ (r = −0.75 and −0.76).

They are usually found during childhood-adolescent age and described as non-traumatic fractures during running with direct physis affection. In order to avoid growth complications, which would lead to harmful consequences for the patient, an accurate diagnosis following a solid treatment has to be carried out. We describe a case report of a 12-year-old football player boy with a tibial tuberosity avulsion following a conservative treatment. Pharmacological treatment and a rehabilitation program was prescribed with a satisfactory evolution. Even though one of the physician consulted suggested open reduction and internal fixation, the medical staff for his team decided a more conservative approach which came out as an adequate management for this case. After a two years follow up the evolution was successful and the player was able to perform every football specific activity pain free and without any kind of limitation.",1
A Descriptive Video Analysis of Helmet Impact Cases in North American Youth Football Players,2022-07-31,2022,Australian International Academic Centre,International Journal of Kinesiology and Sports Science,"Danielle L. Gyemi, Claudia M. Town, Yousef J. Alami, Ron Jadischke, David M. Andrews","Background: Detailed characterization of on-field helmet impacts in football through video analysis has mostly been limited to professional games due to the availability of high quality, multi-view video (e.g., broadcast footage). Few studies have assessed youth football helmet impacts using video-based methods, often with only a single-camera view. Objective: A multi-camera approach was used in this observation-based study to describe the mechanisms and situational factors of in-game helmet impacts experienced by youth football players. Methods: A descriptive video analysis was performed in which video of three games from two old divisions (game A: 9–12 years; games B and C: 13–14 years) was reviewed and parameters related to all cases of observed helmet impact were documented. Results: Overall, 95 helmet impact cases were identified (single helmet contact: 81.1%; multiple helmet contacts: 18.9%), with 115 helmet contacts. Helmet-to-ground contacts were most common (59.1%), followed by helmet-to-helmet (24.3%) and helmet-to-body (16.5%). Helmet impact cases generally occurred during a rush play (67.4%) and were concentrated in the mid-field (81%). Helmet contact locations were predominantly distributed between the rear (upper) (28.7%) and side (upper) (27.8%) helmet regions. Tackling was the most frequent activity leading to helmet impact (41.1%). Conclusion: These findings offer detailed on-field helmet impact characteristics at the youth level that can help inform athlete safety improvement efforts.",1

Urban","This study evaluated head impact exposure (HIE) metrics in relation to individual-level determinants of HIE. Youth (n = 13) and high school (n = 21) football players were instrumented with the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) system during one season. Players completed the Trait-Robustness of Self-Confidence Inventory (TROSCI), Sports Climate Questionnaire (SCQ), and Competitive Aggressiveness and Anger Scale (CAAS), measuring self-confidence, perceived coach support, and competitive aggressiveness, respectively. Relationships between HIE metrics (number of impacts, median and 95th percentile accelerations, and risk-weighted exposure (RWE)) and survey scores were evaluated using linear regression analysis. For middle school athletes, TROSCI scores were significantly negatively associated with the number of competition impacts and the mean number of impacts per player per competition. SCQ scores were significantly positively associated with median linear acceleration during practice. CAAS scores were not significantly associated with biomechanical metrics at either level of play. Perceived coach support and self-confidence might influence HIE among middle school football players. Football athletes' competitive aggressiveness may have less influence their HIE than other factors.",1
Defining movement strategies in soccer instep kicking using the relationship between pelvis and kick leg rotations,2022-07-29,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Simon Augustus, Penny E. Hudson, Neal Smith","Growing evidence suggests skilled ball kickers use distinct pelvis and kick leg strategies to achieve successful performance. However, since the interaction between different strategies remains unexplored, the aims of this study were to a) examine relationships between pelvis and kick leg rotations in male players performing soccer instep kicks and b) classify different 'types' of kickers based on the observed movement strategies. Twenty semi-professional players performed kicks for maximal speed and accuracy, and kick leg and pelvis kinematics were analysed using 3D motion capture (1000 Hz). A strong relationship was found between change in pelvis transverse angular velocity and thigh-knee angular velocity ratio upon ball contact (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), and participants were categorised by their location on kick leg (thigh-knee) and pelvis (maintainer-reverser) continuums. Knowledge of a player's preferred strategy can inform departure from 'one size fits all' technical and conditioning training practices towards more individualised approaches. For example, pelvis maintainer-thigh dominant kickers might benefit from focus towards the concentric capabilities of the hip flexors, whereas reverser-knee dominant kickers might benefit from developing the ability to decelerate the pelvis and thigh to induce motion-dependent angular acceleration of the lower leg towards the ball.",1

For instance, examining the visual perception of athletes within a standardized environment could be helpful to understand the differences between novices and experts in their visual behavior and could further reveal possible training applications for enhancing athletes’ visual attention. The current systematic literature review thematizes the importance of eye-tracking (ET) systems’ usage integrated into head-mounted displays (HMDs) in virtual environments for further inclusion in sports-related usage. An overview of possible implementations is given, and additional recommendations for using the combined technic regarding sports are made. Although only one study examined gaze behavior during sports activity within a standardized virtual environment, 38 relevant papers were identified using the ET systems integrated into the HMDs, which ideas can be transferred to the sports sector. The increased usability and fidelity in the virtual environment enabled through the combined technology were illustrated, and different approaches were listed in using and calculating gaze parameters. This literature review examines the possibility of integrating ET in VR, which can be further used to improve usability, interaction methods, image presentation, and visual perception analyses within future physical training scenarios. The compiled studies have shown that the existing methods are feasible due to the performance of the integrated ET systems but still need to be improved for practical use.",1
Soccer Scoring Techniques—A Biomechanical Re-Conception of Time and Space for Innovations in Soccer Research and Coaching,2022-07-23,2022,MDPI AG,Bioengineering,"Gongbing Shan, Xiang Zhang","Scientifically, both temporal and spatial variables must be examined when developing programs for training various soccer scoring techniques (SSTs). Unfortunately, previous studies on soccer goals have overwhelmingly focused on the development of goal-scoring opportunities or game analysis in elite soccer, leaving the consideration of player-centered temporal-spatial aspects of SSTs mostly neglected. Consequently, there is a scientific gap in the current scoring-opportunity identification and a dearth of scientific concepts for developing SST training in elite soccer.This study aims to bridge the gap by introducing effective/proprioceptive shooting volume and a temporal aspect linked to this volume.the SSTs found in FIFA Puskás Award (132 nominated goals between 2009 and 2021) were quantified by using biomechanical modeling and anthropometry.This study found that players' effective/proprioceptive shooting volume could be sevenfold that of normal practice in current coaching.The overlooked SSTs in research and training practice are commonly airborne and/or acrobatic, which are perceived as high-risk and low-reward. Relying on athletes' talent to improvise on these complex skills can hardly be considered a viable learning/training strategy. Future research should focus on developing player-centered temporal-spatial SST training to help demystify the effectiveness of proprioceptive shooting volume and increase scoring opportunities in soccer.",1
Applying the Bradford Hill Criteria for Causation to Repetitive Head Impacts and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,2022-07-22,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Neurology,"Christopher J. Nowinski, Samantha C. Bureau, Michael E. Buckland, Maurice A. Curtis, Daniel H. Daneshvar, Richard L. M. Faull, Lea T. Grinberg, Elisa L. Hill-Yardin, Helen C. Murray, Alan J. Pearce, Catherine M. Suter, Adam J. White, Adam M. Finkel, Robert C. Cantu","Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with a history of repetitive head impacts (RHI). CTE was described in boxers as early as the 1920s and by the 1950s it was widely accepted that hits to the head caused some boxers to become “punch drunk.” However, the recent discovery of CTE in American and Australian-rules football, soccer, rugby, ice hockey, and other sports has resulted in renewed debate on whether the relationship between RHI and CTE is causal. Identifying the strength of the evidential relationship between CTE and RHI has implications for public health and medico-legal issues. From a public health perspective, environmentally caused diseases can be mitigated or prevented. Medico-legally, millions of children are exposed to RHI through sports participation; this demographic is too young to legally consent to any potential long-term risks associated with this exposure. To better understand the strength of evidence underlying the possible causal relationship between RHI and CTE, we examined the medical literature through the Bradford Hill criteria for causation. The Bradford Hill criteria, first proposed in 1965 by Sir Austin Bradford Hill, provide a framework to determine if one can justifiably move from an observed association to a verdict of causation. The Bradford Hill criteria include nine viewpoints by which to evaluate human epidemiologic evidence to determine if causation can be deduced: strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, and analogy. We explored the question of causation by evaluating studies on CTE as it relates to RHI exposure. Through this lens, we found convincing evidence of a causal relationship between RHI and CTE, as well as an absence of evidence-based alternative explanations. By organizing the CTE literature through this framework, we hope to advance the global conversation on CTE mitigation efforts.",1
Use of Brain Biomechanical Models for Monitoring Impact Exposure in Contact Sports,2022-07-22,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,"Songbai Ji, Mazdak Ghajari, Haojie Mao, Reuben H. Kraft, Marzieh Hajiaghamemar, Matthew B. Panzer, Remy Willinger, Michael D. Gilchrist, Svein Kleiven, Joel D. Stitzel","Abstract Head acceleration measurement sensors are now widely deployed in the field to monitor head kinematic exposure in contact sports. The wealth of impact kinematics data provides valuable, yet challenging, opportunities to study the biomechanical basis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and subconcussive kinematic exposure. Head impact kinematics are translated into brain mechanical responses through physics-based computational simulations using validated brain models to study the mechanisms of injury. First, this article reviews representative legacy and contemporary brain biomechanical models primarily used for blunt impact simulation. Then, it summarizes perspectives regarding the development and validation of these models, and discusses how simulation results can be interpreted to facilitate injury risk assessment and head acceleration exposure monitoring in the context of contact sports. Recommendations and consensus statements are presented on the use of validated brain models in conjunction with kinematic sensor data to understand the biomechanics of mTBI and subconcussion. Mainly, there is general consensus that validated brain models have strong potential to improve injury prediction and interpretation of subconcussive kinematic exposure over global head kinematics alone. Nevertheless, a major roadblock to this capability is the lack of sufficient data encompassing different sports, sex, age and other factors. The authors recommend further integration of sensor data and simulations with modern data science techniques to generate large datasets of exposures and predicted brain responses along with associated clinical findings. These efforts are anticipated to help better understand the biomechanical basis of mTBI and improve the effectiveness in monitoring kinematic exposure in contact sports for risk and injury mitigation purposes.",1
A Data Analytics Approach to Assess the Functional and Physical Performance of Female Soccer Players: A Cohort Design,2022-07-22,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Francisco Tomás González-Fernández, Alfonso Castillo-Rodríguez, Lorena Rodríguez-García, Filipe Manuel Clemente, Ana Filipa Silva","The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to observe the individual results of fitness status [countermovement jump (CMJ)], hop test, linear sprinting time, stride frequency, stride distance, force-power-velocity, peak power maximal and maximal speed, and repeated sprint ability (RSA) and functional performance (overhead squat, single-leg squat test, dumbbell hip-hinge, Thomas test, hip extension, and internal and external hip rotators) and (ii) to analyze the relationship between anthropometrical measures and values of fitness status with % of difference in the Thomas test, hip extension, and internal and external hip rotators.The study followed a cohort design. Sixteen female soccer players competing in the second division of the Spanish league were monitored during the first days of the pre-season. These players were evaluated three times during the preseason of the cohort period. The dataset showed a negative moderate correlation between time and percentage of difference in hip angle and another positive moderate correlation between maximal sprint and percentage of difference in hip angle (r = -0.54, p = 0.02 and r = 0.53, p = 0.04), respectively. The correlations of stride time and distance with hip extension are interesting, as professional soccer players should have higher levels of hip flexor flexibility during the stride phase, recoil of the instep kick action.",1
Is the Rotatory Knee Stability Immediately Decreased Following a Competitive Soccer Match?,2022-07-22,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Alejandro Neira, Rony Silvestre, Aníbal Debandi, Daniel Darras, Iver Cristi-Sánchez, Ignacio Barra, Luis Peñailillo, Carlos De La Fuente","Fatigue induced by soccer playing increases physical efforts, which might alter the transverse knee stability, a known factor that promotes knee injuries, particularly anterior cruciate ligament injury. Thereby, primarily, we aimed to determine whether rotatory knee stability decreases immediately following a competitive soccer match in amateur players. Furthermore, we assessed the role of the preferred and non-preferred limbs to kick a ball in rotatory knee stability and the correlation between performance parameters and rotatory knee stability. We hypothesized that the knee stability decreases immediately after a competitive soccer match in amateur players. Eight healthy amateur soccer players (aged 27.2 ± 4.7 years and with body mass index of 23.8 ± 1.2 kg m-2) were included immediately before and after a competitive soccer match. The rotatory knee stability was assessed in the preferred and non-preferred limbs through the acceleration and jerk of the pivot shift maneuver and by the internal knee rotation of a pivoting landing task. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for factors time (before and after the soccer match) and limb (preferred and non-preferred) and multiple comparisons were performed using α = 5%. There was a statistical significance for the main factor time in the acceleration (5.04 vs. 6.90 ms-2, Δ = 1.86 ms-2, p = 0.020, η2 = 0.331) and jerk (18.46 vs. 32.10 ms-2, Δ = 13.64 ms-2, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.456) of the pivot shift maneuver. Rotatory stability decreases following a competitive soccer match in amateur soccer players under fatigue. Both the acceleration and jerk during the pivot shift maneuver is increased without significant internal knee rotation changes during the pivoting landing task.",1

Tight Margins: Compression Garment Use during Exercise and Recovery—A Systematic Review,2022-07-21,2022,MDPI AG,Textiles,"Alana J. Leabeater, Lachlan P. James, Matthew W. Driller","Background: Compression garments (CGs) are a popular tool that may act on physiological, physical, neuromuscular, biomechanical, and/or perceptual domains during exercise and recovery from exercise, with varying levels of efficacy. While previous reviews have focused on the effects of CGs during running, high-intensity exercise, and exercise recovery, a comprehensive systematic review that assesses the effectiveness of garment use both during and after exercise has not been recently conducted. Methods: A systematic search of the literature from the earliest record until May 2022 was performed based on the PRISMA-P guidelines for systematic reviews, using the online databases PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar. Results: 160 articles with 2530 total participants were included for analysis in the systematic review, comprised of 103 ‘during exercise’ studies, 42 ‘during recovery’ studies, and 15 combined design studies. Conclusions: During exercise, CGs have a limited effect on global measures of endurance performance but may improve some sport-specific variables (e.g., countermovement jump height). Most muscle proteins/metabolites are unchanged with the use of CGs during exercise, though measures of blood lactate tend to be lowered. CGs for recovery appear to have a positive benefit on subsequent bouts of endurance (e.g., cycling time trials) and resistance exercise (e.g., isokinetic dynamometry). CGs are associated with reductions in lactate dehydrogenase during recovery and are consistently associated with decreases in perceived muscle soreness following fatiguing exercise. This review may provide a useful point of reference for practitioners and researchers interested in the effect of CGs on particular outcome variables or exercise types.",1
Mechanisms of ACL injuries in men’s football: A systematic video analysis over six seasons in the Qatari professional league,2022-07-21,2022,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Raouf Rekik, Roald Bahr, Flavio Cruz, Paul Read, Rod Whiteley, Pieter D’hooghe, Montassar Tabben, Karim Chamari","To assess the mechanisms of ACL injury in male professional football players in Qatar across multiple seasons using systematic video analysis. 15 ACL injuries occurred in competition among the professional football teams that participated in an injury Surveillance Programme during 6 seasons (2013/2014 to 2018/2019). High-definition broadcast videos of these injuries were analyzed (49 views; 34 slow motion) by five analysts who independently described the injury mechanisms (situation, behavior, biomechanical characteristics) using validated observational tools. A knee valgus mechanism was observed in two-thirds of the cases (1 with direct contact to the knee, 3 with indirect contact (other body parts) and 6 with no contact). No visible valgus was reported in 2 of the direct knee contact injuries, while 3 cases of non-contact and indirect contact injuries were unclear. We observed 4 main categories of injury situation among those (n = 12) classified as non-contact/ indirect contact (multiple combinations were possible): pressing (n = 6), tackling or being tackled (n = 4), blocking (n = 3) and screening (n = 2). Direct contact injuries (n = 3) were suffered by 2 players during tackling and 1 whilst being tackled. Contact injuries represented only 20% of ACL injuries occurring during competition in Qatari professional soccer players. Independent of the playing situation, knee valgus was frequently observed (10/15 cases). Pressing was the most common situation (6/15 cases) leading to injury. Landing after heading was not reported in any of these ACL injuries.",1

Many player-games are lost due to the lack of a clear understanding of risk factors and the absence of effective methods to minimize re-injury. This paper describes the protocol that will be followed to develop the HAMstring InjuRy (HAMIR) index risk prediction models for HSI and re-injury based on morphological, architectural, biomechanical and clinical factors in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate football players. A 3-year, prospective study will be conducted involving collegiate football student-athletes at four institutions. Enrolled participants will complete preseason assessments of eccentric hamstring strength, on-field sprinting biomechanics and muscle-tendon volumes using magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI). Athletic trainers will monitor injuries and exposure for the duration of the study. Participants who sustain an HSI will undergo a clinical assessment at the time of injury along with MRI examinations. Following completion of structured rehabilitation and return to unrestricted sport participation, clinical assessments, MRI examinations and sprinting biomechanics will be repeated. Injury recurrence will be monitored through a 6-month follow-up period. HAMIR index prediction models for index HSI injury and re-injury will be constructed. The most appropriate strategies for reducing risk of HSI are likely multi-factorial and depend on risk factors unique to each athlete. This study will be the largest-of-its-kind (1200 player-years) to gather detailed information on index and recurrent HSI, and will be the first study to simultaneously investigate the effect of morphological, biomechanical and clinical variables on risk of HSI in collegiate football athletes. The quantitative HAMIR index will be formulated to identify an athlete's propensity for HSI, and more importantly, identify targets for injury mitigation, thereby reducing the global burden of HSI in high-level American football players.

The effect of physical fatigue on the performance of soccer players: A systematic review,2022-07-14,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Felipe Dambroz, Filipe Manuel Clemente, Israel Teoldo","This study aimed to carry out a systematic review to analyze, describe and discuss the effect of physical fatigue on the performance of soccer players. For this systematic review, searches were performed in Pubmed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus electronic database until October 3, 2020, following the guidelines of PRISMA. A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria: i) healthy soccer players from any age group, competitive level or sex; ii) exposure to physical fatigue; iii) pre and post-physical fatigue conditions; iv) players' cognitive, technical, physical and tactical performances and v) no restrictions regarding the study design. The results section was organized in four main dimensions: cognitive, technical, physical and tactical. Studies on cognitive performance have shown divergent results, varying according to the cognitive task employed and the physical protocol used. Regarding technical performance, negative effects of physical fatigue were found on the technical fundamentals of the pass, dribble and kick. With regard to physical performance, studies have shown a reduction in sprint capacity and distances covered at high velocity. Finally, the only study that analyzed the tactical performance in the field showed an increase in the team's collective tactical behavior, but did not include analysis of the players' individual tactical actions. In summary, the results of the analyzed studies show that the effect of physical fatigue on cognitive performance is inconclusive and that technical and physical performance are negatively affected. Regarding tactical performance, there is a lack of information on the topic in the current literature.",1
Epidemiology of Patella Instability Injuries in Collegiate Level Athletes in the United States,2022-07-14,2022,Athenaeum Scientific Publishers,Journal of Orthopaedic Science and Research,Christine S Williams,"Objective: Patella instability injuries are often sports-related and occur in young athletes. These injuries severely impact the season and career trajectory of high-level competitors. This is the first large epidemiological study that evaluates these injury events in NCAA athletes. Methods: Patellar instability injuries across 16 sports among NCAA men and women during the 2004-05 to 2013-14 academic years were analyzed using the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP). Patellar instability injuries per 100,000 Athlete-Exposures (AEs), operative rate, annual injury and reinjury rates, in-season status (pre/regular/post-season) and time lost were compiled and calculated. Results: A total of 11,778,265 Athlete-Exposures (AE) were identified and included. 380 patellar instability injuries were identified (Injury Rate IR = 3.23 per 100,000 AEs). 91 (23.95%) were severe injuries with a significantly higher time loss from play (40.5 days) and risk of operative management (50.55%). The most common sports during which a patellar instability event occurred were Women’s Gymnastics (IR=7.87), Soccer (IR=5.83), and Basketball (IR=4.34) and Men’s Wrestling (IR=5.44), Football (IR=4.84), and Soccer (IR=3.06). Male athletes had a statistically significant higher risk of season or career-ending injuries in all patellar instability injuries (3.20% vs 0.89%, p=0.0013). Severe injuries were more likely to result from contact mechanisms (58.24% vs 40.66%). Conclusion: Patella instability injuries have a profound impact on the longevity and sustainability of a collegiate athletes’ career. The risk of recurrence once a patellar injury has occurred is significant and athletes often require surgery. While more female athletes sustained these injuries, male athletes were more likely to require operative management and sustain a season-ending injury.",1
Apophyseal Avulsion of the Rectus Femoris Tendon Origin in Adolescent Soccer Players,2022-07-08,2022,MDPI AG,Children,"Hanneke Weel, A. J. Peter Joosten, Christiaan J. A. van Bergen","Apophyseal avulsions of the rectus femorus tendon (RFT) at the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) can occur in adolescents, often while performing soccer. Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) and time to return to sport of these patients are relatively unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the PROMs and return to sports of patients with AIIS avulsions and compare the results with those reported in the literature. This is a case series of seven consecutive patients presenting at our hospital between 2018 and 2020 with an apophyseal avulsion of the RFT from the AIIS. The patients were assessed with use of the WOMAC and Tegner scores and return to sports was evaluated. All patients were male soccer players (median age 13 years; range, 12-17). They were all initially treated non-operatively. One of the patients subsequently needed excision surgery of a heterotopic ossification because of non-transient hip impingement. All other patients recovered after a period of relative rest. Median time to return to sports was 2.5 months (range, 2-3). At a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 18-45), the WOMAC (median, 100; range, 91-100) and Tegner scores (median, 9; range, 5-9) were high. In accordance with the existing literature, most patients with apophyseal avulsions of the AIIS recover well with non-operative treatment. However, the avulsion can lead to hip impingement due to heterotopic ossifications possibly needing surgical excision. Sport resumption is achievable after 2-3 months, and patient-reported outcomes are highly satisfactory in the long term.",1

So far, most research focused on the landing phase of dynamic tasks where most ACL injuries occur. This study will assess whether these landing alterations are also present in the propulsion phase, in an attempt to identify generalized movement alterations.Twenty-one athletes with ACLR (cleared by their surgeon and/or physiotherapist for return-to-sport) and twenty-one controls performed five single-leg hop tasks. Propulsion kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activations were compared between legs and between groups.Increased hamstrings activation was found during propulsion when comparing the ACLR limb with both the uninjured limb and the controls. In addition, decreased internal knee extension moments were found in the ACLR limb compared with the uninjured limb.Athletes with ACLR show task-independent alterations that unload the knee during the propulsion phase of single-leg hopping tasks. If longitudinal data deem these alterations to be maladaptive, more emphasis must be placed on their normalization during the propulsion phase, assuming beneficial carryover effects into the landing phase. Normalizing these patterns during rehabilitation may potentially reduce the risk of long-term complications such as reinjuries and posttraumatic osteoarthritis.",1
Biomechanical analysis and modeling of anterior cruciate ligament rupture conditions: focus on female football (soccer) players,2022-07-06,2022,IEEE,"2022 IEEE International Workshop on Sport, Technology and Research (STAR)","Linda Tonelli, Francesco Biral, Andrea Zignoli, Damiano Fruet, Vigilio Fontanari","In the sport context, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is the second most common injury. It predominantly occurs when pivoting, single-leg landing, sharp changes in running direction on uneven surfaces are required. It is reported that female athletes have 4 to 6 times higher risk than men to suffer from some sort of ACL injury. With a modelling approach, the goal of this work is to investigate the most critical knee configuration for ACL integrity and the main risk factors that predispose to ACL injuries. A musculoskeletal model has been developed and finely tuned with experimental data collected in a motion capture laboratory. Static optimisation has been used to solve the redundant system of equations of motion, which was used to describe the anterior posterior balance between muscle and ligament forces along the tibial plateau. Results suggest that: 1) at small knee flexion angles the ACL injury can occur due to ACL alignment with tangential forces acting in parallel at the tibial plateau and no other major synergistic actions; 2) at high knee flexion angles, ACL is exposed together with the hamstrings to high tension forces. Therefore, this work confirms that the ability of the hamstrings to generate high forces is of key importance for preserving the integrity of the ACL in critical knee configurations.",1

Biomechanical Characteristics of the Support Leg During Side-Foot Kicking in Soccer Players With Chronic Ankle Instability,2022-07-01,2022,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Akihiro Tamura, Keita Shimura, Yuri Inoue","Chronic ankle instability (CAI) in soccer players can increase the risk of recurrent ankle varus sprains and damage the articular surface of the ankle joint, thus increasing the risk of osteoarthritis. It is important to understand the biomechanical characteristics of the support leg during kicking in soccer players with CAI.The purpose of this study was to clarify the kinematics of the kicking motion of soccer players with CAI. It was hypothesized that at the point before ball contact when the support leg makes flat-foot contact with the ground, soccer players with CAI will land with ankle inversion in the support leg during a side-foot kick compared with players without CAI.Controlled laboratory study.The study cohort included 19 male college soccer players (mean age, 20.5 ± 0.9 years) with greater than 8 years of soccer experience who were recruited from August 2019 to March 2020. Of these athletes, 10 had CAI and 9 had no CAI in the support leg, as diagnosed according to the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool. Kinematic data for the trunk, hip, knee, and foot of the support leg during a side-foot kick were obtained using a 3-dimensional, motion-analysis system. The Mann-Whitney U test or Student t test was selected to identify differences in variables between the CAI and non-CAI groups.There were no significant differences in physical characteristics between the CAI and non-CAI groups. At the point when the support leg made flat-foot contact with the ground, the players with CAI had more eversion of the hindfoot with respect to the tibia (-28.3° ± 12.1° vs -13.9° ± 14.2°; P = .03), a more varus alignment of the knee (26.0° ± 10.7° vs 13.7° ± 10.5°; P = .03), and a lower arch height index (0.210 ± 0.161 vs 0.233 ± 0.214; P = .046) compared with non-CAI players.Significant differences between players with and without CAI were seen in the support leg kinematics at flat-foot contact with the ground during the kicking cycle.The biomechanical alignment of the support leg during a side-foot kick in players with CAI may reflect a subconscious attempt to avoid inversion of the foot and further ankle sprains.",1

The findings of the present study indicated a significant correlation between speed and all of the COD tests, additionally between the CMJA and 9-6-3-6-9 COD test. Therefore, elite female soccer players with higher maximum acceleration rates and speed tend to perform better in change of direction tests. On the other hand, jump performance does not significantly correlate with COD ability.",1
Poster 250: Increased Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries for Female but Not Male Soccer Players on Artificial Turf Versus Natural Grass: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2022-07-01,2022,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Jacie Lemos, Calvin Hwang, Seth Sherman, Marc Safran, Geoffrey Abrams, Michelle Xiao","Objectives: Both natural grass (NG) and artificial turf (AT) are popular playing surfaces for soccer. Biomechanical studies have found increased frictional forces on artificial turf that may lead to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Few studies have examined the differences between ACL injury risk in male and female soccer athletes playing on AT versus NG. Given the higher risk for female ACL injury in sports, and soccer in particular, it is important to define whether AT may compound this injury risk. The purpose of this investigation was to systematically review the literature for studies comparing ACL injury risk on AT versus NG in soccer, and to specifically determine if there were differences in injury risk in males versus females when considering the playing surface. Methods: A systematic review was pre-registered on PROSPERO and performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for Level I-III studies that compared the incidence of ACL injuries on AT versus NG in soccer players. Data recorded included study demographics, sex, competition level, exposure setting (games or practices), turf type, and ACL injury information. Study methodological quality was analyzed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) score. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by dividing the incidence of ACL injury on AT over NG, where IRRs &lt; 1 indicate a lower incidence of ACL injuries on AT compared to NG, and IRRs &gt; 1 signify a higher incidence of ACL injuries on AT compared to NG. A Mantel-Haenszel random effects model was used for meta-analyses of IRRs, and forest plots were generated for the pooled IRR for ACL injuries in game and training settings. Additionally, sub-analyses based on athlete sex were conducted for IRRs of ACL injuries in games. A p-value of less than 0.05 was set as significant. Results: Seven articles (four male, two female, one male and female cohort; mean MINORS score 20 + 0.8) were included and analyzed (Figure 1). There were two studies that investigated ACL injuries in a female only cohort, four studies that used a male only cohort, and one study that included both males and females (Table 1). Levels of play included professional (n = 3 studies), college (n = 3 studies), and youth (n = 1 studies). Pooled ACL injury IRRs demonstrated no significant differences in overall ACL injury risk when playing soccer on AT compared to NG (IRR = 0.61 [0.23-1.60], p = 0.31; Figure 2). A significantly increased risk of ACL injury in games played on AT compared to NG was detected for females (IRR = 1.18 [1.05-1.31], p = 0.004) but not for males (IRR = 1.18 [0.97- 1.42], p = 0.09; Figure 3). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in injury risk for games (IRR = 1.07 [0.97- 1.18], p = 0.20) or practices (IRR = 0.21 [0.04-1.23], p = 0.09; Figure 2). A total of 3,023 ACL injuries occurred on NG and 526 ACL injuries happened on AT, and the majority of soccer exposures in each study was on NG (range: 50.33% - 85.74%). Conclusions: .This investigation found that females had a significantly higher risk of ACL injury when playing games on AT versus NG, whereas no significant difference was seen in males. No differences were found for the combined male/female population nor soccer games or training sessions played on AT compared to NG.

Comparison of Isometric Strength of the Trunk and Hip Muscle Groups in Female Athletes with and without Low Back Pain: A Cross-Sectional Study,2022-06-30,2022,Academic World Research,Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,"Niloufar Kazemkhani, Shabnam ShahAli, Sanaz Shanbehzadeh","Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder in athletes. Reduced strength in hip and trunk muscles has been observed among non-athletes with low back pain. This study aimed to compare the strength of trunk and hip muscles between female athletes with and without LBP and to investigate strength association with disability level in female athletes with LBP. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 26 female athletes with LBP and 30 female athletes without LBP. The strength of the trunk and hip muscles was measured using a hand-held dynamometer and the impact of LBP on the sports activities and activities of daily living was measured using the Athletes Disability Index (ADI). Data analysis was done using an independent sample t test and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: There were no significant differences between groups for trunk and hip muscles strength (p > 0.05). A fair to moderate correlation was seen between the strength of the trunk, hip abductors, flexor and extensors muscles and the scores of the ADI questionnaire in the LBP group (r = -0.26 to -0.48). However, there was no significant correlation between the strength of hip adductor muscles and the scores on the ADI questionnaire. Conclusion: Based on the results, the strength of trunk and hip muscles was not different between athletes with and without LBP. It is recommended that athletes' training be done during functional tasks rather than strengthening a single muscle group.",1
Meta-Analysis of Knee Joint Function Recovery after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction by Accelerated Rehabilitation Surgery,2022-06-29,2022,Wiley,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"Junxiang Xu, Minzhe Zheng, Zongxian Feng, Lingxiao Pan, Zhaoxiang Peng","This investigation was undertaken to systematically assess the impact of increasingly rapid recovery treatment on the functional status of the knee following anterior cruciate ligament restructuring.Computer search from the establishment of the database to March 2022 in China Knowledge Network Database (CNKI), PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, CochraneLibrary, China VIP Database, Wanfang Database, and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The control group was given only traditional rehabilitation training, and the observation group was treated with perioperative accelerated rehabilitation surgery intervention randomized controlled trial (RCT). Data for all included studies were extracted by two independent researchers, and the risk of bias for the quality of each included study was assessed by the Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 criteria. Meta-analysis of the collected data by using RevMan5.4 statistical software.A total of 593 articles were retrieved from the computer database and 8 RCT articles with a total of 636 samples were finally included for meta-analysis. According to the Jadad scale, the RCT score of 8 articles was ≥4 points. Meta-analysis was performed on the postoperative VAS scores of the ERAS group and the traditional rehabilitation group, and the heterogeneity test showed Chi2 = 288.60, df = 5, P < 0.00001, and I2 = 99%. There was a statistically significant difference in the postoperative VAS scale between the intervention and the traditional rehabilitation model (P < 0.05). Eight articles reported the effect of accelerated rehabilitation surgery on the recovery of knee joint motion after ACL rehabilitation. After meta-analysis, the heterogeneity test showed Chi2 = 314.98, df = 7, P < 0.00001, and I2 = 98%, and it can be concluded from the analysis that, compared with the traditional rehabilitation model, the enhanced rehabilitation surgery has an effect on the joint function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The improvement effect was more significant, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Four articles reported the effect of enhanced recovery after surgery intervention on the range of motion of the knee joint of patients, the heterogeneity test showed Chi2 = 117.52, df = 2, P < 0.00001, and I2 = 98%, through analysis, and compared with the traditional rehabilitation model and the enhanced recovery. The effect of surgery on the range of motion of the knee joint after ACL reconstruction was more significant, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The effect of enhanced recovery after surgery and traditional rehabilitation mode on the incidence of postoperative adverse reactions in patients undergoing ACL reoperation was analyzed. The results of heterogeneity test showed that Chi2 = 1.59, df = 2, P=0.66 > 0.05, and I2 = 98%, and the analysis showed that, compared with the traditional rehabilitation mode, enhanced rehabilitation surgery can significantly reduce the risk of adverse reactions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (P < 0.05). An inverted funnel plot was used to analyze publication bias in studies with quality of life as an outcome measure. The results showed that Egger's test P=0.0005 < 0.001 suggesting that there may be a certain degree of publication bias.The existing research evidence shows that accelerating the reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament can effectively promote the recovery of knee joint function, reduce the pain of patients, and reduce postoperative complications. However, more research is needed to further verify this.",1
Effects of an intermittent exercise protocol on ankle control during a single-legged landing,2022-06-28,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sport Sciences for Health,"Lakshmi R. Ayalath, Rodrigo Bini, Daniel W. T.

Methods Seventeen males aged (mean ± SD) 22.2 ± 2.0 years participated in this repeated measures study. A 90-min intermittent exercise protocol with a 15-min rest at halftime was performed. Before, at halftime and after the exercise, participants were tested via a single-legged drop landing task onto a force platform whilst wearing a three-dimensional inertial measurement system (Xsens). Ankle angles (plantarflexion/dorsiflexion and inversion/eversion) were analysed before landing and at peak ground reaction force after landing, and center of pressure was analysed at peak ground reaction force. Results No significant differences were found for the outcomes between pre-, halftime and post-exercise ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Findings suggest that exercises simulating a soccer match (regarding exertion) do not necessarily lead to significant changes in ankle motion or forces around the ankle.",1
Relative skeletal maturity status affects injury burden in<scp>U14</scp>elite academy football players,2022-06-25,2022,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Xabier Monasterio, Iraia Bidaurrazaga‐Letona, Jon Larruskain, Jose A. Lekue, Gontzal Diaz‐Beitia, Juan M. Santisteban, Imanol Martin‐Garetxana, Susana M. Gil","Maturation progresses at different times and at different rates between individuals. Thus, differences in maturity status exist among players in the same chronological age-based category, especially in U14 players. The purpose of this prospective study was to describe injury burden according to the relative skeletal maturity status in U14 elite academy football players. From 2011 to 2020, injuries and individual exposure (training and match) were prospectively recorded in 183 male U14 players. Skeletal age (SA) was assessed using the Tanner-Whitehouse 2 method. Relative skeletal maturity status [SA minus chronological age (CA)] was classified as follows: early (SA-CA > 0.5), on-time (SA-CA ± 0.5), and late (SA-CA < -0.5). Overall and specific injury burden (days lost/1000 h) and rate ratios for comparisons between groups were calculated. Overall injury burden was 2.8 times higher (3.6 times in training) in early maturers compared with late maturers. Growth-related injuries were the most burdensome injuries in all three groups, but significant differences were not found between groups. Muscle injuries were 4 times more burdensome in early maturers compared with on-time and late maturers. Besides, joint/ligament injuries were 7 and 12 times less burdensome in late maturers than in on-time and late maturers, respectively. Significant differences between groups in overall and specific injury burden were not found in matches. Our results showed different injury patterns in U14 early, on-time, and late maturers. Hence, monitoring maturity seems crucial to detect potential injuries that cause the greatest disruption, and facilitate design of targeted injury prevention programs.",1

Resistance Exercise for Improving Running Economy and Running Biomechanics and Decreasing Running-Related Injury Risk: A Narrative Review,2022-06-24,2022,MDPI AG,Sports,"Anja Šuc, Pija Šarko, Jernej Pleša, Žiga Kozinc","It is well-accepted that at least a certain amount of resistance exercise (RE) is recommended for most endurance athletes. In this review, we aim to summarize the evidence regarding the effects of RE on running economy, running biomechanics, and running-related injury risk in endurance runners. The evidence robustly shows that lower limb RE is effective for improving running economy and performance, with a combination of strength and plyometric training being recommended to improve RE. Isometric training is also emerging as a possible alternative to implement during periods of high overall training load. Lower limb RE may change some aspects of joint kinematics during running; however, the evidence regarding the effects on kinetics is limited. Lower limb RE may help reduce running-related injury risk, but further evidence is needed.",1

Visuomotor Adaptation of Lower Extremity Movements During Virtual Ball-Kicking Task,2022-06-23,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Mai Moriyama, Motoki Kouzaki, Shota Hagio","Sophisticated soccer players can skillfully manipulate a ball with their feet depending on the external environment. This ability of goal-directed control in the lower limbs has not been fully elucidated, although upper limb movements have been studied extensively using motor adaptation tasks. The purpose of this study was to clarify how the goal-directed movements of the lower limbs is acquired by conducting an experiment of visuomotor adaptation in ball-kicking movements. In this study, healthy young participants with and without experience playing soccer or futsal performed ball-kicking movements. They were instructed to move a cursor representing the right foot position and shoot a virtual ball to a target on a display in front of them. During the learning trials, the trajectories of the virtual ball were rotated by 15° either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the actual ball direction. As a result, participants adapted their lower limb movements to novel visuomotor perturbation regardless of the soccer playing experience, and changed their whole trajectories not just the kicking position during adaptation. These results indicate that the goal-directed lower limb movements can be adapted to the novel environment. Moreover, it was suggested that fundamental structure of visuomotor adaptation is common between goal-directed movements in the upper and lower limbs.",1

Complex sports specific movements often require balance ability. This is accountable for injury prevention as well. Balance control is vital to athletes for all sports activities. It is the objective of the current study to develop and identify balance training program effectiveness in improving dynamic balance among athletes in Malaysian National Sport Schools.&#x0D; Material and Methods. This study used a true experimental with control group design, involved dynamic balance control measures before and after intervention. A total of 72 male and female athletes were randomly assigned into experimental group or control group after screening process for eligibility. The experimental group underwent 12 sessions of balance training program and the control group continued their usual training routine. The Y-Balance Test was utilized to quantify dynamic balance for both groups. Data was analyzed using independent and paired sample t-test.&#x0D; Results. The study finding indicated that the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement in the post-test compared to pre-test (p = 0.000, p &lt; 0.001) but no significant changes happened to control group (p = 0.353, p &gt; 0.05). Independent t-test showed during post-test, the experimental group attained better score compared to the control group (p = 0.000, p &lt; 0.001).&#x0D; Conclusions. It is suggested that coaches and athletes may include this balance training program in their training regimen, hoping to help in improving dynamic balance, thus, to reduce risk of lower extremity injuries. Future studies are suggested to increase more variances of balance training and make comparison on their effectiveness as a way to obtain a more effective training program.",1
Perceptual-Cognitive Tasks Affect Landing Performance of Soccer Players at Different Levels of Fatigue,2022-06-14,2022,Wiley,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,"Yuanyuan Ren, Guodong Wang, Lei Zhang, Aming Lu, Cenyi Wang","There is a possible interaction between the underlying mechanisms of perceptual-cognitive tasks and motor control. For example, landing biomechanics changed during perceptual-cognitive tasks undertaken at different levels of fatigue of the athlete. Thus, this study explored the effect of perception-cognitive tasks interventions on male soccer players' landing mechanisms at different levels of fatigue.Perceptual-cognitive tasks during games were simulated using classic multiple object tracking (MOT) paradigms, and 15 male soccer players completed MOT tasks under nonfatigue (NF), moderate fatigue (MF), and severe fatigue (SF). Landing-associated indicators were collected and calculated using a Vicon and force measuring platform.Level of fatigue and MOT task significantly affected hip and knee flexion angles, hip and knee extension moments, and vertical ground reaction force. Specifically, hip and knee flexion angles were significantly higher in MOT than non-MOT tasks at all levels of fatigue. In NF state, hip and knee extension moments were significantly smaller during MOT than non-MOT tasks. In SF state, the hip extension moment was larger during MOT than non-MOT tasks. In both MF and SF states, vertical ground reaction force was significantly higher in MOT than non-MOT tasks.Although soccer players landed cautiously when not fatigued, they were significantly less able to do this and handle challenging perceptual-cognitive task movements when fatigued. Thus, landing performance is affected by perceptual-cognitive task interference in fatigue conditions.",1
Scoring of Human Body-Balance Ability on Wobble Board Based on the Geometric Solution,2022-06-11,2022,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Hang Thi Phuong Nguyen, Yeongju Woo, Ngoc Nguyen Huynh, Hieyong Jeong","Many studies have reported that the human body-balance ability was essential in the early detection and self-management of chronic diseases. However, devices to measure balance, such as motion capture and force plates, are expensive and require a particular space for installation as well as specialized knowledge for analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to propose and verify a new algorithm to score the human body-balance ability on the wobble board (HBBAWB), based on a geometric solution using a cheap and portable device. Although the center of gravity (COG), the projected point of the center of mass (COM) on the fixed ground, has been used as the index for the balance ability, generally, it was not proper to use the COG under the condition of no fixed environment. The reason was that the COG index did not include the information on the slope for the wobble. Thus, this study defined the new index as the perpendicular-projection point (PPP), which was the projected point of the COM on the tilted plane. The proposed geometric solution utilized the relationship among three points, the PPP, the COM, and the middle point between the two feet, via linear regression. The experimental results found that the geometric solution, which utilized the relationship between the three angles of the equivalent model, enabled us to score the HBBAWB.",1
Programming Plyometric-Jump Training in Soccer: A Review,2022-06-10,2022,MDPI AG,Sports,"Rodrigo Ramirez-Campillo, Jason Moran, Jon L. Oliver, Jason S. Pedley, Rhodri S. Lloyd, Urs Granacher","The aim of this review was to describe and summarize the scientific literature on programming parameters related to jump or plyometric training in male and female soccer players of different ages and fitness levels. A literature search was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus using keywords related to the main topic of this study (e.g., “ballistic” and “plyometric”). According to the PICOS framework, the population for the review was restricted to soccer players, involved in jump or plyometric training. Among 7556 identified studies, 90 were eligible for inclusion. Only 12 studies were found for females. Most studies (n = 52) were conducted with youth male players. Moreover, only 35 studies determined the effectiveness of a given jump training programming factor. Based on the limited available research, it seems that a dose of 7 weeks (1–2 sessions per week), with ~80 jumps (specific of combined types) per session, using near-maximal or maximal intensity, with adequate recovery between repetitions (&lt;15 s), sets (≥30 s) and sessions (≥24–48 h), using progressive overload and taper strategies, using appropriate surfaces (e.g., grass), and applied in a well-rested state, when combined with other training methods, would increase the outcome of effective and safe plyometric-jump training interventions aimed at improving soccer players physical fitness. In conclusion, jump training is an effective and easy-to-administer training approach for youth, adult, male and female soccer players. However, optimal programming for plyometric-jump training in soccer is yet to be determined in future research.",1

Time loss injuries and player exposures were recorded individually in 6754 unique players. Injury incidence and burden were reported as the number of injuries and days absence per 1000 h with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Injury severity was reported as median absence in days with the interquartile range (IQR).Out of 25,462 reported injuries, 93 (0.4%) were diagnosed as AAIS (38%) or PAIS (62%) in 77 players. AAIS and PAIS were similar regarding injury characteristics except for a greater proportion of AAIS having a gradual onset (69% vs.47%; P = 0.03) and being re-injuries (31% vs. 9%; P = 0.01). Impingement syndromes resulted in an overall incidence of 0.03 injuries (95% CI 0.02-0.03) per 1000 h and an injury burden of 0.4 absence days per 1000 h. PAIS incidence was significantly higher than that for AAIS [0.02 (95% CI 0.002-0.03) vs. 0.01 (95% CI 0.005-0.01) injuries per 1000 h (RR = 1.7). The absence was significantly longer in AAIS than in PAIS [10 (22) vs. 6 (11) days; P = 0.023]. Impingement syndromes that presented with a gradual onset had longer absences in comparison to impingement with an acute onset [8 (22) vs. 5 (11) days; P = 0.014]. Match play was associated with a higher incidence and greater injury burden than training: 0.08 vs. 0.02 injuries per 1000 h (RR 4.7), respectively, and 0.9 vs. 0.3 days absence per 1000 h (RR 2.5).Ankle injuries are frequent in men's professional soccer and ankle impingement is increasingly recognized as a common source of pain, limited range of motion, and potential time loss. In our study, ankle impingement was the cause of time loss in less than 0.5% of all injuries. PAIS was more frequently reported than AAIS, but AAIS was associated with more absence days and a higher re-injury rate than PAIS. The findings in this study can assist the physician in best practice management on ankle impingment syndromes in professional football.II.",1

This method limits the joint from moving through the complete length of a motion, creates an occlusion effect, and thus causes the type 1 muscle fibers to work anaerobically. Thirty-six soccer players, with 5-8 years of soccer playing experience, were pretested for accuracy then retested ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mtext>rtt</mtext> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.92</mn> </math> ) and divided into random groups from the Associação Banco do Brasil Futebol Clube—Group A, Paraná Futebol Clube—Group P, and Coritiba Futebol Clube—Group C.

COMMITMENT OF COACHES: IT’S RELATION TO THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT-ATHLETES,2022-06-01,2022,International Journal of Research Publications,International Journal of Research Publications,Rubyrose R. del Rosario,"This inquiry determined the impact of coaching commitment on the physical development of students-athlete. It includes the level of coaching commitment and level of physical development. It also involves the relationship of coaching commitment to the physical development of the student-athlete. Descriptive research design was employed using Grades 9 to 10 were the respondents, chosen through purposive sampling technique in which checklist type of questionnaire was used. It is a combination of a standard questionnaire that the researcher adapted and made a few revisions to fit the study and a self-made questionnaire and inputs were taken from the review of related literature and studies. Descriptive statistics, Weighted Mean and Standard Deviation, and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (r), were used to test the hypotheses. Related readings on the literature and studies were gathered in the formulation of the hypothesis and the conceptual framework which was presented in a form of a paradigm. The findings revealed the level of coaching commitment is very high. The level of coaching commitment in terms of Competition Strategies attained a mean score of 4.40, Goal Setting attained a mean score of 4.35, Knowledge in Sports attained a mean score of 4.44, , Mental Preparation attained a mean score of 4.29, Personal Rapport/ Negative Personal Rapport attained a mean score of 4.36, of Physical Training and Condition attained a mean score of 4.43, Teamwork attained a mean score of 4.54, , Technical Skills attained a mean score of 4.52, and Time Management attained a mean score of 4.43 which is also very high. The level of physical development is highly developed (3.45). The level of physical development in terms of caring (3.59), character (3.57), competence (3.310), confidence (3.31), and connections (3.47) is also highly developed. The result showed that Competition Strategies, Goal Setting, Physical Training and Condition, Teamwork, Technical Skills, and Time Management were observed to have no significant effect to the Caring, Character, Competence, Confidence, and Connection of the respondents. Thus, Mental Preparation was observed to have a significant negative effect on caring. Also, Personal Rapport/ Negative Personal Rapport were observed to have a significant positive effect on Caring, Character and Connection. Furthermore, Knowledge in Sports was observed to have a significant positive effect on Connection. It can be inferred that at 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis that ?Coaching commitment does not significantly affect physical development? is rejected. This calls for the acceptance of the alternative which incites that there is a significant effect on the commitment of coaches to the physical development of student-athletes.",1
Quantitative analysis of postural control of COPD patients during activities of daily living (ATTRACTION): a study protocol,2022-06-01,2022,Societe Francaise de Physiotherapie,European Rehabilitation Journal,"Romain Pichon, Mathieu Ménard, Diane Hearing, Graziella Brinchault, Armel Crétual","Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease and is associated with the presence of numerous comorbidities. Among these, impaired postural control has been reported to be common in this population. However, postural control has not been extensively studied in tasks of daily living in this population. Novel solutions for postural control assessment exist, like the quantitative motion analysis, which has demonstrated to be a robust and accurate tool. Objective: the main aim of this study is to characterize the postural control of COPD patients during tasks of daily living compared to that of control subjects using quantitative motion analysis. The secondary aims of this study are to examine the associations between postural control variables of interest and various clinical factors and to investigate the utility of the modified Glittre-ADL for the clinical assessment of postural control in daily task. Method: A case-control study will be conducted with a group of sixteen COPD patients and a control group of sixteen participants. Quantitative movement analysis will be used to assess postural control during a modified Glittre-ADL test (incorporating tasks of daily living) and timed-up-and-go tests (under normal and dual-task conditions). Clinical factors (e.g., dyspnea, pain, inspiratory muscle strength, falls, fear of falling, etc.) will also be assessed. Discussion: ATTRACTION will be the first study to propose the assessment of postural control in various daily living tasks in COPD patients using quantitative movement analysis and has the potential to precise the relation between postural control and several clinical factors.",1
An Infrapatellar Fat Pad Tear in a High School Football Player: A Case Report,2022-06-01,2022,Bowling Green State University Libraries,Journal of Sports Medicine and Allied Health Sciences: Official Journal of the Ohio Athletic Trainers' Association,Brian Seiler,"Objective: To present a clinical case exploring the occurrence and management of a tear to the infrapatellar fat pad IFP of a high school football player. Background: Acute tears to the IFP are rare. Typically, the IFP becomes impinged (i.e., Hoffa’s disease) through a fall, direct knee trauma, or surgical complications, and requires conservative treatment. Treatment: A 15-year-old high school football player reported to the athletic training clinical complaining of right knee discomfort and the inability to fully flex the knee. The patient stated that during a field goal attempt he missed the ball and hyperextended his right knee. Hoffa’s disease and impingement of the IFP have been well documented, but these injuries have a different mechanism of injury. Uniqueness: More common injuries to the IFP occur because of microtraumas (i.e., Hoffa’s disease) or direct trauma to the knee (i.e., IFP impingement) in older populations. For this patient, the mechanism of injury was non-contact and minimal swelling, and no visual deformity or discoloration were present to suggest an injury. Additionally, the patient was able to complete functional movements with complaining only of “weird tightness” in the knee during extension. Conclusion: Due to the similarity of multiple knee pathologies, unknown mechanisms of injury need to be considered when evaluating the knee structure. Further examination is needed to determine demographic data and the probability of a non-contact injury is to the IFP, especially in pediatric patients.",1

Biomechanical and Neuromuscular Performance Requirements of Horizontal Deceleration: A Review with Implications for Random Intermittent Multi-Directional Sports,2022-05-29,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Damian J. Harper, Alistair J. McBurnie, Thomas Dos’ Santos, Ola Eriksrud, Martin Evans, Daniel D. Cohen, David Rhodes, Christopher Carling, John Kiely","Abstract Rapid horizontal accelerations and decelerations are crucial events enabling the changes of velocity and direction integral to sports involving random intermittent multi-directional movements. However, relative to horizontal acceleration, there have been considerably fewer scientific investigations into the biomechanical and neuromuscular demands of horizontal deceleration and the qualities underpinning horizontal deceleration performance. Accordingly, the aims of this review article are to: (1) conduct an evidence-based review of the biomechanical demands of horizontal deceleration and (2) identify biomechanical and neuromuscular performance determinants of horizontal deceleration, with the aim of outlining relevant performance implications for random intermittent multi-directional sports. We highlight that horizontal decelerations have a unique ground reaction force profile, characterised by high-impact peak forces and loading rates. The highest magnitude of these forces occurs during the early stance phase (&lt; 50 ms) and is shown to be up to 2.7 times greater than those seen during the first steps of a maximal horizontal acceleration. As such, inability for either limb to tolerate these forces may result in a diminished ability to brake, subsequently reducing deceleration capacity, and increasing vulnerability to excessive forces that could heighten injury risk and severity of muscle damage. Two factors are highlighted as especially important for enhancing horizontal deceleration ability: (1) braking force control and (2) braking force attenuation. Whilst various eccentric strength qualities have been reported to be important for achieving these purposes, the potential importance of concentric, isometric and reactive strength, in addition to an enhanced technical ability to apply braking force is also highlighted. Last, the review provides recommended research directions to enhance future understanding of horizontal deceleration ability.",1
Knee osteoarthritis and management of the retired athlete: the role of osteotomy,2022-05-28,2022,Elsevier BV,Journal of Cartilage &amp; Joint Preservation,"Pamela Garcia Pulido, Paul Hegarty, Alan Getgood","Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common pathology in retired professional football players. Their lifetime risk of presenting with symptomatic OA with associated radiographic changes is higher than that of the general population. The increased risk of OA is predominantly associated with previous injury and repetitive microtrauma to the knee. Previous studies have also found an association between a higher prevalence of a varus phenotype and knee OA in this group of athletes. Despite this, the use of realignment osteotomy in this specific population has not been widely researched. An earlier realignment procedure, before the advent of severe radiographic disease, may be beneficial to optimize postoperative outcome, biological response to unloading, and subsequent knee survivorship. The purpose of this narrative review is to consider the role knee osteotomy can play in the treatment of OA in this specific patient population by discussing the biomechanical rationale behind it as well as the relevant literature.",1

While some ACL injuries are unavoidable such as those resulting from a tackle, others that occur in non-contact situations like twisting and turning in the absence of external contact might be more preventable. Because ACL injuries commonly occur in team ball-sports that involve jumping, landing and cutting manoeuvres, accurate information about the epidemiology of non-contact ACL injuries in these sports is needed to quantify their extent and burden to guide resource allocation for risk-reduction efforts.",1
REPERCUSSIONS OF BALANCE TRAINING ON SOCCER PLAYERS’ LOWER LIMB INJURIES,2022-05-27,2022,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte,Wenping Liu,"ABSTRACT Introduction Soccer is a combative event that requires particular skills and physical fitness. The unique soccer characteristics determine the high incidence of joint injuries in the lower limbs. In this regard, balance training has proven to be particularly important, as research indicates a reduction in lower limb injuries justified by the gain in the athletes’ muscle control capacity. Objective This paper analyzes the repercussions of balance training on lower limb injuries in soccer players. Methods 16 soccer players were randomly divided into experimental and control groups, without statistical difference. Both performed routine training first, with subsequent adherence to balance training by the experimental group. The experiment lasted eight weeks, and the balance training was based on an exercise protocol of approximately 30 minutes, three times a week, for eight weeks. Indexers on recovery from lower limb injury were statistically analyzed and compared. Results After balance training, soccer players in the experimental group improved faster. At the same time, the lower limb injury was effectively improved. Conclusion The balance training method can reduce the probability of lower limb injuries in soccer players.

Biomechanical Risk Factors of Injury-Related Single-Leg Movements in Male Elite Youth Soccer Players,2022-05-26,2022,MDPI AG,Biomechanics,"Mathias Kolodziej, Steffen Willwacher, Kevin Nolte, Marcus Schmidt, Thomas Jaitner","Altered movement patterns during single-leg movements in soccer increase the risk of lower-extremity non-contact injuries. The identification of biomechanical parameters associated with lower-extremity injuries can enrich knowledge of injury risks and facilitate injury prevention. Fifty-six elite youth soccer players performed a single-leg drop landing task and an unanticipated side-step cutting task. Three-dimensional ankle, knee and hip kinematic and kinetic data were obtained, and non-contact lower-extremity injuries were documented throughout the season. Risk profiling was assessed using a multivariate approach utilising a decision tree model (classification and regression tree method). The decision tree model indicated peak knee frontal plane angle, peak vertical ground reaction force, ankle frontal plane moment and knee transverse plane angle at initial contact (in this hierarchical order) for the single-leg landing task as important biomechanical parameters to discriminate between injured and non-injured players. Hip sagittal plane angle at initial contact, peak ankle transverse plane angle and hip sagittal plane moment (in this hierarchical order) were indicated as risk factors for the unanticipated cutting task. Ankle, knee and hip kinematics, as well as ankle and hip kinetics, during single-leg high-risk movements can provide a good indication of injury risk in elite youth soccer players.",1
Fundamental Movement Skills and Physical Fitness Are Key Correlates of Tactical Soccer Skill in Grassroots Soccer Players Aged 8–14 Years,2022-05-26,2022,Human Kinetics,Journal of Motor Learning and Development,"Michael J. Duncan, Neil D. Clarke, Lee Bolt, Emma Eyre, Clare M.P. Roscoe","One hundred and twenty-one children (58 boys and 63 girls) aged 8–14 years (mean ± SD = 12 ± 1 years) who were regularly engaged in grassroots soccer participated in this study. Participants undertook assessments of fundamental movement skill (FMS) using the Test of Gross Motor Development-3, perceived ability using the Perceived Physical Ability Scale for Children, physical fitness via 15-m sprint time, standing long jump distance, and technical skill using the university of Ghent dribbling test. The Procedural Tactical Knowledge Test was employed as a measure of tactical skill from which metrics for positioning and movement and recognizing spaces were derived. Maturation was determined from anthropometric measures. Analysis of covariance examined gender differences in tactical skills accounting for FMS, fitness, perceived ability, technical skill, maturation, and age. Results indicated no significant differences in tactical skills between boys and girls ( p &gt; .05). For recognizing spaces, 56% of the variance was explained with FMS ( p = .001), physical fitness ( p = .02), and technical skill ( p = .02) contributing to the model. For positioning and movement, a significant model explained 55% of the variance in this element of tactical behavior with FMS ( p = .002) and technical skill ( p = .02) significantly contributing to the model.",1
Observation on the Effect of MRI Image Scanning on Knee Pain in Football Injury,2022-05-25,2022,Wiley,Scanning,Weidong Yu,"To study the effect of football injury on knee pain based on MRI image scanning, in this paper, a total of 31 knee injuries of 29 male professional football players from December 2012 to April 2015 were used as the experimental group. The players were 23.6 ± 3.5 years old and received professional football training time 15.3 ± 3.6 years; 31 outpatients of the same age group with acute knee joint acute injury were randomly selected as the control group; both groups were imaged with a 1.5 TMR scanner and knee joint standard array coil imaging, and 2 senior radiation surgeons evaluate knee cartilage, meniscus, ligaments, tendons, bone marrow, infrapatellar fat pad, and joint effusions. Pearson's chi-squared test and nonparametric test for two independent samples were used for statistical testing of the evaluation results. The experimental results showed that there were significant differences in the incidence of articular cartilage, lateral collateral ligament, tendon or ligament injury, multiligament or tendon injury, and bone marrow edema between the two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of medial collateral ligament injury, infrapatellar fat pad edema, and joint effusion. MRI shows that knee injuries in male professional football players often involve ligaments or tendons, mostly multiligament or tendon injuries. The lesions of articular cartilage and meniscus are more common and serious, and bone marrow edema is also more common in football injuries. MRI has high diagnostic accuracy for various clinical knee injuries, and it belongs to a noninvasive examination method. It can not only reflect the pathological changes and changes of the knee joints of patients but also provide information for the formulation of clinical programs and the judgment of prognosis, for timely, accurate, and comprehensive imaging reference.",1
Investigating the Knuckleball Effect in Soccer Using a Smart Ball and Training Machine,2022-05-24,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"David Eager, Karlos Ishac, Shilei Zhou, Imam Hossain","The term knuckleball in sporting jargon is used to describe a ball that has been launched with minimal spin, resulting in a trajectory that is erratic and unpredictable. This phenomenon was first observed in baseball (where the term originated) and has since been observed in other sports. While knuckleball has long fascinated the scientific community, the bulk of research has primarily focused on knuckleball as it occurs in baseball. Following the changes in the design of the soccer ball after the 2006 World Cup, knuckleball and ball aerodynamics were exploited by soccer players. This research examined the properties of a knuckleball in the sport of soccer. We designed and evaluated a system that could reproduce the knuckleball effect on soccer balls based on previous theories and characteristics outlined in our literature review. Our system is comprised of the Adidas miCoach Smart Ball, a companion smart phone app for data collection, a ball-launching machine with programmable functions, and a video-based tracking system and Tracker motion analysis software. The results from the testing showed that our system was successfully able to produce knuckleball behaviour on the football in a highly consistent manner. This verified the dynamic models of knuckleball that we outline. While a small portion of the data showed some lateral deviations (zig-zag trajectory), this erratic and unpredictable trajectory was much smaller in magnitude when compared to examples seen in professional games. The sensor data from the miCoach app and trajectory data from the Tracker motion analysis software, showed that the knuckleballs were consistently reproduced in-line with theoretical dynamics.",1
Knee and ankle biomechanics in 90° side cutting on synthetic turf with shock pad,2022-05-24,2022,Informa UK Limited,Footwear Science,"Thomas Elvidge, Sean Brown, Kevin Valenzuela, John Sorochan, Joshua T. Weinhandl, Songning Zhang","The purpose of this study was to examine differences in knee and ankle biomechanics on synthetic turf with and without a shock pad in two approach velocities during a 90° cutting movement. Twelve recreational male American football or soccer players performed five trials of 90° side cutting in each of four conditions: turf only and turf with shock pad at approach velocity of 3.0 and 4.0 m/s. A two-way (surface × approach velocity) ANOVA was used to analyse selected variables. Knee and ankle variables were generally similar across surface conditions. However, peak knee frontal-plane loading eccentric power was greater (p = 0.013) while peak knee frontal-plane push-off eccentric power was reduced on the shock pad (p = 0.020). A surface × approach velocity interaction was detected for peak knee sagittal-plane eccentric power (p = 0.018), and a post-hoc analysis found a significant increase of peak knee sagittal-plane eccentric power at a faster approach speed on the turf only condition compared to the turf with the shock pad. There were increases in the knee extension moments (p = 0.004), peak push-off medial ground reaction force (GRF, p = 0.025), peak ankle eversion moment (p < 0.001), and ankle inversion ROM (p = 0.001) as approach velocity increased while peak push-off vertical GRF decreased (p = 0.011). The effects of the inclusion of a shock pad on lower extremity loading during a 90° cutting movement are limited. The results indicate that the turf with the shock pad absorbs more kinetic energy as speed increases than the turf alone.",1
Greater Breast Support Alters Trunk and Knee Joint Biomechanics Commonly Associated With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,2022-05-20,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Hailey B. Fong, Alexis K. Nelson, Julie E. Storey, Jay Hinton, Melissa Puppa, Deirdre McGhee, Daniel Greenwood, Douglas W. Powell","The female breast is a passive tissue with little intrinsic support. Therefore, women rely on external breast support (sports bras) to control breast motion during athletic tasks. Research has demonstrated that lower levels of breast support are associated with altered trunk and pelvis movement patterns during running, a common athletic task. However, no previous study has identified the effect of sports bra support on movement patterns during other athletic tasks including landing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of breast support on trunk and knee joint biomechanics in female collegiate athletes during a double-leg landing task.Fourteen female collegiate athletes completed five double-leg landing trials in each of three different sports bra conditions: no support, low support, and high support. A 10-camera motion capture system (250 Hz, Qualisys, Goteburg, Sweden) and two force platforms (1,250 Hz, AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) were used to collect three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces simultaneously. Visual 3D was used to calculate trunk segment and knee joint angles and moments. Custom software (MATLAB 2021a) was used to determine discrete values of dependent variables including vertical breast displacement, knee joint and trunk segment angles at initial contact and 100 ms post-initial contact, and peak knee joint moments. A repeated measures analysis of covariance with post-hoc paired samples t-tests were used to evaluate the effect of breast support on landing biomechanics.Increasing levels of breast support were associated with reductions in peak knee flexion (Right: p = 0.008; Left: p = 0.029) and peak knee valgus angles (Right: p = 0.011; Left: p = 0.003) as well as reductions in peak knee valgus moments (Right: p = 0.033; Left: p = 0.013). There were no changes in peak knee extension moments (Right: p = 0.216; Left: p = 0.261). Increasing levels of breast support were associated with greater trunk flexion angles at initial contact (p = 0.024) and greater peak trunk flexion angles (p = 0.002).Lower levels of breast support are associated with knee joint and trunk biomechanical profiles suggested to increase ACL injury risk.",1

Accompanying the increase in participation in sports is the increase incidence of injury in lower limb like hip, knee and ankle in both male and female athletes. The purpose of this study was to examine the static posture of lower limb parameters with overuse injury. This study is conducted with the two groups of 40 subjects i.e. Group A is Injured 20 Athletes and Group B is Non-Injured 20 Athletes. Seven variables were measured: standing pelvic position, hip position, standing sagittal knee position, standing frontal knee position, hamstring length, prone subtalar joint position, and navicular drop test.This study has been found strong relationship static posture of lower limb with pelvic position, femoral anteversion and navicular drop test. And this study also shows the low relationship with Hamstring length, standing knee extension angle and subtalar joint and normal relation with standing sagittal knee extension in lower limb with static posture in injured recreational athletes.This study concluded that the injury is affecting the biomechanics and even the relative static posture of the lower limb parameters with injured and Non-injured Athlete.

The Biomechanics Effect of Hamstring Flexibility on the Risk of Osgood-Schlatter Disease,2022-05-09,2022,Wiley,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,"Xueying Zhang, Weiyan Ren, Yijie Duan, Jie Yao, Fang Pu","Background. The relationship between hamstring flexibility and the risk of OSD continues to be a debate, and whether hamstring stretching exercises should be considered as one of the conservative treatments of OSD is still unclear. Objectives. To investigate the relationship between hamstring flexibility and the risk of OSD by assessing the changes of loading on the tibial tuberosity caused by the changes of hamstring optimal lengths. Methods. Experimental data of a young adult running at 4 m/s were used, which were collected by an eight-camera motion capture system together with an instrumented treadmill. Muscle forces were estimated in OpenSim when hamstring optimal lengths changed in the range of 70–130% of the control case in 5% increments. The force and accumulated force of quadriceps muscle were calculated to evaluate the impact of hamstring optimal lengths on the loading on tibial tuberosity. The changes in muscle forces throughout the gait cycle were compared by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The average peak force and accumulated force of five gait cycles were compared. Results. Although the maximum force of the quadriceps muscle was slightly affected by changes in hamstring optimal lengths, the accumulated force of quadriceps muscle increased by 21.97% with hamstring optimal lengths decreased by 30% of the control case. The increase of the muscle force mainly occurred in the early stance phase and terminal swing phase ( <a:math xmlns:a=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <a:mi>P</a:mi> <a:mo>&lt;</a:mo> <a:mn>0.05</a:mn> </a:math> ). However, when hamstring optimal lengths were longer than the control, it had a little effect on accumulated force of quadriceps muscle. Conclusions. The results of this study indicate that a shorter hamstring optimal length, which means lack of flexibility, can cause a high accumulated force on tibial tuberosity, thus increasing the risk of OSD. Hamstring stretching exercise is only effective for people with lack of hamstring flexibility.",1
The Effect of Soccer and Lacrosse Participation and Video Verified Head Impact Biomechanics on Clinical Concussion Measures,2022-05-02,2022,Science Repository OU,Neurology and Neurobiology,"Thomas G. Bowman, Thomas G. Bowman, Monica R. Lininger, Amanda O. Esquivel, Katherine M. Breedlove","Neurocognitive changes have been found in participants of contact sports without documented concussions, raising concerns regarding the long-term consequences of subconcussive head impacts in sport. However, sex comparisons of neurocognitive change without reported concussions have not been completed for soccer or lacrosse athletes. Our purpose was to determine changes in clinical measures of cognitive function in uninjured collegiate lacrosse and soccer players. Men’s soccer (N=23), women’s soccer (N=36), men’s lacrosse (N=28) and women’s lacrosse (N=31) players wore xPatch head impact monitoring sensors for all practices and games. Sensors measured peak linear accelerations and peak rotational accelerations, allowing for daily density calculations. Participants completed the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 and Immediate Post-Concussion and Cognitive Testing at the beginning and end of the season. For women, multiple statistically significant relationships were identified [decreased reaction time with increased cumulative peak linear acceleration (rs=-0.30, P=0.03), peak linear acceleration daily density (rs=-0.31, P=0.04), and peak rotational acceleration daily density (rs=-0.31, P=0.03) and also Immediate Post-Concussion and Cognitive Testing symptom change increased with increased cumulative peak linear acceleration (rs=-0.38, P=0.008) and cumulative peak rotational acceleration (rs=-0.37, P=0.009)]. For men, cognitive change scores, specifically concentration, had the only statistically significant relationship with cumulative peak rotational acceleration (rs=0.32, P=0.02). Men had a greater number of changes over the course of the season compared to women; however, the changes did not appear related to head impact biomechanics. Women had many statistically significant correlations between head impacts and deterioration in some constructs, especially symptoms.",1
Extended reality in musculoskeletal rehabilitation and injury prevention - A systematic review,2022-05-01,2022,Elsevier BV,Physical Therapy in Sport,"Joke Schuermans, Alena Van Hootegem, Margo Van den Bossche, Marjolein Van Gendt, Erik Witvrouw, Evi Wezenbeek","Unlike in neurological patient populations, the effects of Extended Reality within the context of sports medicine have rarely been studied. This systematic review was conducted to investigate the value of Extended Realty-assisted rehabilitation and injury prevention strategies on injury rehabilitation and prevention outcomes. PubMed and Web of Science databases were consulted. The search strategy consisted of the terms Virtual Reality (Intervention), rehabilitation and injury prevention (Outcome) and healthy athletes or athletes with a musculoskeletal sports injury (Population). After eligibility and Risk of Bias screening, ten articles were included. Risk of Bias analysis resulted in a level of evidence varying between C (three articles), B (six articles) and A2 (one article) scores. Extended Reality was found to provide an added value for both sports injury prevention and rehabilitation outcomes. It particularly provides clinicians with the opportunity to address the underlying biomechanical risk profile for common sports injuries, allowing the athletes to train protective movement patterns more effectively. More large-scale high-quality prospective research is needed in order to determine whether Extended Reality-assisted therapy is superior to conventional therapy in sports rehabilitation and injury prevention circles with strong conclusive evidence.",1

Analysis of the participation of women in football in Indonesia,2022-04-30,2022,Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia,SPORT TK-Revista EuroAmericana de Ciencias del Deporte,"Rumi Iqbal Doewes, Islahuzzaman Nuryadin","In general, football is considered a male-dominated sport but recent trends show a significant improvement in women’s participation in the sport. The aim of this study was to identify and explain the reasons for women’s participation in football in Indonesia. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 29 female athletes of the Indonesian women’s national football team using the Participation Motivation Questionnaire (PMQ) assessed by Guttman scale. The data was analyzed using a descriptive percentage approach and then grouped based on participation criteria. The results showed that more than half of the women participants in football in Indonesia were 17 years old (53%) and had a senior high school education (66%). Most of the time, women participants were encouraged by peers (87%), parents (86%), facilities and infrastructures (97%), awareness (76%), interest (79%), attachment (87%), and loyalty (90%). Participation rates were also influenced by the existence of football clubs (100%) and the training programs implemented (100%). It is concluded that women’s football participation in Indonesia is largely influenced by micro-level factors (peers and parents), macro-level factors (existence of football clubs, their facilities and infrastructures, and their training programs), and psycho-sociological factors (awareness, interest, attachment and loyalty).",1

"A comparative study of instep kicking swings, ball impacts, and ball speeds in male and female football players",2022-04-30,2022,Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia,SPORT TK-Revista EuroAmericana de Ciencias del Deporte,"Rumi Iqbal Doewes, Gunathevan Elumalai, Singgih Hendarto, Pomo Warih Adi, - Manshuralhudlori","This research aims to compare swings, ball impacts, and ball velocities of instep kick between male and female players. The research used comparative design method, in which two groups of males and females were compared. This research used eight Indonesian football players as sample: four males and four females. The instrument used for data collection in this research is football long pass test. Video documentation was taken with high-speed camera unit with 1000 fps ability. The data collected were then analyzed through Kinovea, in which swing angles, foot angular velocities, ball impact times, ball velocities, and resulting ball distances were calculated. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test were used to compare each instep kick of male and female players. Results show that no difference on instep long pass swing and ball impact between male and female players was observed. On average, male players performed instep kicking with kicking foot knee flexion angle of 104.750, hip angle of 77.250, kicking foot knee extension angle of 1580, kicking foot steepness angle of 58.250, average power of 209.38 J/s (watt), and average kicking foot angular velocity of 0.11 rad/s, which resulted in average ball impact of 10.27 Ns that caused average post-impact ball velocity of 22.83 m/s and average ball distance of 26.63 meters. Meanwhile, female players performed instep kicking with kicking foot knee flexion angle of 930, hip angle of 74.250, kicking foot knee extension angle of 1480, kicking foot steepness angle of 56.250, average power of 237.28 J/s (watt), and average kicking foot angular velocity of 0.11 rad/s which resulted in average ball impact of 10.32 Ns that caused average post-impact ball velocity of 22.94 m/s and average ball distance of 26.87 meters. The results show that the average ball distance of male players was closer to 25-meter target than those of female players. In order to achieve 25-meter kicking accuracy, female players contributed greater power and steeper kicking foot angle than their male counterparts. In conclusion, to master instep kicking technique, female players need to pay attention to their power and body position during kicking.",1
Lower limb posture and joint mobility in young Soccer players,2022-04-29,2022,Firenze University Press,Italian Journal of Anatomy and Embryology,"Piergiorgio Francia, Carlo Ferri Marini, Sonia Toni, Francesco Lucertini, Ario Federici, Giulia Iannone, Ferdinando Paternostro, Barbara Piccini","Soccer practice can induce marked changes in the lower limbs with dreaded short and long term consequences. We evaluated the possible effects of sport practice on lower limb posture and their relationships with ankle joint mobility (AJM). In 61 male Soccer players mean age 11.6±1.8 years, and in 50 Volleyball and Basketball players matched for age, sex and body mass index, lower limb posture and AJM in both plantar flexion and dorsiflexion were evaluated on the sagittal plane in supine position using, respectively, images analysis and an inclinometer. A multivariate analysis of variance was carried out to assess if the practice of different sports affects the leg posture (FP: angle between foot and leg) and foot posture (LP: angle between the foot and the line perpendicular to the ground). The sport practiced showed a significant multivariate effect on the lower limb posture. Soccer players showed a greater LP angle (169.2±4.3° vs 164.9±4.5°; p&lt;0.001) and a lesser FP angle in both Basketball and Volleyball players (298.0±12.6° vs 305.6±10.9°; p&lt;0.002). These differences were not present between the Basketball and Volleyball players. Soccer players showed a reduced AJM (127.6±15.7° vs. 138.8±21.6°; p&lt;0.002) compared to the other subjects evaluated. The AJM was found directly correlated to the FP angle (p&lt;0.005). The results of this study indicate that young Soccer players could show an altered posture of the leg and foot and a reduced AJM. The alterations of these parameters seem to be a consequence of the sport practice.",1
Head Impact Kinematics and Brain Deformation in Paired Opposing Youth Football Players,2022-04-28,2022,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Gabriella M. Milef, Logan E. Miller, Daniella M. DiGuglielmo, Tanner D. Payne, Tanner M. Filben, Jillian E. Urban, Joel D. Stitzel","Head impact exposure is often quantified using peak resultant kinematics. While kinematics describes the inertial response of the brain to impact, they do not fully capture the dynamic brain response. Strain, a measure of the tissue-level response of the brain, may be a better predictor of injury. In this study, kinematic and strain metrics were compared to contact characteristics in youth football. Players on 2 opposing teams were instrumented with head impact sensors to record impact kinematics. Video was collected to identify contact scenarios involving opposing instrumented players (ie, paired contact scenarios) and code contact characteristics (eg, player role, impact location). A previously validated, high-resolution brain finite element model, the atlas-based brain model, was used to simulate head impacts and calculate strain metrics. Fifty-two paired contact scenarios (n = 105 impacts) were evaluated. Lighter players tended to have greater biomechanical metrics compared to heavier players. Impacts to the top of the helmet were associated with lower strain metrics. Overall, strain was better correlated with rotational kinematics, suggesting these metrics may be better predictors of the tissue-level brain response than linear kinematics. Understanding the effect of contact characteristics on brain strain will inform future efforts to improve sport safety.",1

Our pipeline composites multiple camera views together, performs 3D body pose estimation, uses this data to control a rigged human model with inverse kinematics, and exposes the resulting user avatar to end user applications. We developed a series of demo applications illustrating the potential of our approach and more leg-centric interactions, such as balancing games and kicking soccer balls.

Youth Tackle Football Head-Impact Estimation by Players and Parents: Is the Perception the Reality?,2022-04-27,2022,National Athletic Trainers' Association,Journal of Athletic Training,"Julianne D. Schmidt, Rachel S. Johnson, Landon B. Lempke, Melissa Anderson, Rachel Khinh Le, Robert C. Lynall","Context With growing concerns surrounding exposure to head impacts in youth tackle football, players and parents must understand the exposure level when assenting and consenting to participate. Objective To determine whether youth football players and parents could estimate on-field head-impact frequency, severity, and location. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Football field. Patients or Other Participants We administered a 10-question head-impact estimation tool to parents (n = 23; mean age = 36.5 years [95% CI = 31.7, 37.3 years]) and players (n = 16 boys; mean age = 11.1 years [95% CI = 10.3, 11.8 years]). Main Outcome Measure(s) Player on-field head-impact exposure was captured using the Triax SIM-G system. We determined the accuracy between player and parent estimates relative to on-field head-impact exposures using κ and weighted κ values. Results Youth tackle football players and parents did not accurately estimate on-field head-impact frequency (κ range = −0.09 to 0.40), severity (κ range = −0.05 to 0.34), or location (κ range = −0.30 to 0.13). Players and parents overestimated head-impact frequency in practices but underestimated the frequency in games. Both groups overestimated head-impact severity, particularly in games. Most players and parents underestimated the number of head impacts to the top of the head, particularly during practices. Conclusions Underestimations of head-impact frequency in games and to the top of the head suggest that informed consent processes aimed at educating players and parents should be improved. Overestimations of head-impact frequency in practices and severity may explain declining rates of youth tackle football participation.",1
Assessment of Fatigue and Recovery in Sport: Narrative Review,2022-04-25,2022,Georg Thieme Verlag KG,International Journal of Sports Medicine,"Thomas Bestwick-Stevenson, Rebecca Toone, Emma Neupert, Kimberley Edwards, Stefan Kluzek","Abstract Fatigue is a phenomenon associated with decreases in both physical and cognitive performances and increases in injury occurrence. Competitive athletes are required to complete demanding training programs with high workloads to elicit the physiological and musculoskeletal adaptations plus skill acquisition necessary for performance. High workloads, especially sudden rapid increases in training loads, are associated with the occurrence of fatigue. At present, there is limited evidence elucidating the underlying mechanisms associating the fatigue generated by higher workloads and with an increase in injury risk. The multidimensional nature and manifestation of fatigue have led to differing definitions and dichotomies of the term. Consequently, a plethora of physiological, biochemical, psychological and performance markers have been proposed to measure fatigue and recovery. Those include self-reported scales, countermovement jump performance, heart rate variability, and saliva and serum biomarker analyses. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of fatigue and recovery plus methods of assessments.",1
A commentary on soccer match-play simulations for applied research and practice,2022-04-25,2022,Informa UK Limited,Science and Medicine in Football,"Adam C. Field, Liam D. Harper, Jeffrey W. F. Aldous, Richard M. Page","Soccer is a fast-growing area of research, demonstrated by a 10-fold increase in the number of PubMed articles derived from the search term 'soccer' between 2001 and 2021. The scope of contemporary soccer-related articles ranges from match-play observations to laboratory evaluations of performance. The activity profile of soccer match-play is variable and techniques to collect data within matches are limited. Soccer-specific simulations have been developed to simulate the evolving demands of match-play. The evolutionary designs of novel simulations provide a reproducible exercise stimulus for varying researcher and practitioner objectives. The applied researcher can utilise simulations to investigate the efficacy of nutritional interventions and environmental stress on performance, while assessing the physiological and biomechanical responses to representations of match-play. Practitioners can adopt simulations for rehabilitation to progressively facilitate return-to-play processes, while implementing extra top-up conditioning sessions for unused and partial-match players. However, there are complexities involved with the selection of varying simulations which are dependent on the research question or practical application. There also remains a paucity of published information to support researchers and practitioners in selecting from differing simulation models. To assist with researcher and practitioner interpretations, we present a commentary of the current simulations to inform decision-making processes for research and training purposes and enhance the application of future research. An objective scoring system was adopted for rating the research and practical applications of each simulation design. Overall scores of 22, 16 and 18 out of 36 were revealed for free-running (n = 7), non-motorised- (n = 4) and motorised-treadmill-based simulations (n = 4), respectively.",1

Methods: Eighteen elite youth male soccer players reported their rating of perceived exertion 10 min after each practice during twelve micro-cycles.In each micro-cycle, differentiated management of the task characteristics for each training day was implemented.A Random Forest Clustering was used to automatically assign each training session to one cluster and allowed to create similar groups and contrast them with the sessions prescribed by the coaching staff.Results: Proper manipulation of different variables of small-sided games (number of players, relative playing area per player, game orientation, training regimen) can automatically differentiate training sessions.Youth soccer players can also perceive each training session differently (p < .05).Conclusions: Using different formats of smallsided games in each training session may be interesting to modulate the player's perceived load during the micro-cycle.However, results should be interpreted with caution, due to representing a single team and coaching staff.",1
"The Associations Among Self-Compassion, Self-Esteem, Self-Criticism, and Concern Over Mistakes in Response to Biomechanical Feedback in Athletes",2022-04-19,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Yasamin Alipour Ataabadi, Danielle L. Cormier, Kent C. Kowalski, Alison R. Oates, Leah J. Ferguson, Joel L. Lanovaz","Athletes regularly face the possibility of failing to meet expectations in training and competition, and it is essential that they are equipped with strategies to facilitate coping after receiving performance feedback. Self-compassion is a potential resource to help athletes manage the various setbacks that arise in sport over and above other psychological resources. The primary purpose of this research was to explore how athletes respond to objective biomechanical feedback given after a performance. Specifically, we investigated if levels of self-compassion, self-esteem, self-criticism, and concern over mistakes were related to one another before and after a series of sprint tests interspersed with biomechanical feedback, and whether self-compassionate athletes achieved a better sprint performance after receiving and implementing biomechanical feedback. Forty-eight athletes (20 female: Mage = 19.8 years, SD = 3.1; 28 male: Mage = 23.6 years, SD = 7.8) completed online measures of self-compassion, self-esteem, self-criticism and concern over mistakes before performing four sets of 40-m sprints. Participants received personalized biomechanical feedback after each sprint that compared their performance to gold standard results. Following all sprints, they then completed measures of self-criticism, and reported emotions, thoughts, and reactions. Self-compassion was positively correlated with self-esteem (r = 0.57, p < 0.01) and negatively related to both self-criticism (r = -0.52, p < 0.01) and concern over mistakes (r = -0.69, p < 0.01). We also found that athletes with higher levels of self-compassion prior to sprint performance experienced less self-critical thoughts following biomechanical feedback and subsequent sprint trials (r = -0.38, p < 0.01). Although the results of this study provide some support for the effectiveness of self-compassion in promoting healthy emotions, thoughts, and reactions in response to sprint performance-based biomechanical feedback, a moderated regression analysis between the first and fourth sprint time variables revealed that self-compassion was not a moderator for change in sprint performance (R2 = 0.64, ΔR2 = 0.10, p > 0.05). These findings suggest that there are likely longer-term benefits of athletes using self-compassion to cope with biomechanical feedback, but that any benefits might be limited in a short series of sprint trials.",1
Contribution of segmental kinetic energy to forward propulsion of the centre of mass: Analysis of sprint acceleration,2022-04-18,2022,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Jean Slawinski, Nicolas Houel, Camille Moreau, Alexia Mahlig, Daniel Dinu","This study aimed to measure the contribution of each body segment to the production of total body kinetic energy (KE) during a 40-m sprint. Nine recreational sprinters performed two 40-m sprints wearing a MVN Biomech suit (Xsens). Data recorded were used to calculate total body KE, and the KE of each segment. The KE of each segment was then expressed as a percentage of the total body KE. We divided the sprint into three phases: 1 – start to maximal power (Pmax), 2 – Pmax to maximal velocity (Vmax), and 3 – Vmax to the end of the 40 m. Total body KE increased from the start to the end of the 40-m sprint (from 331.3 ± 68.4 J in phase 1 to 2378.8 ± 233.0 J in phase 3; p ≤ 0.001). The contribution of the head–trunk increased (from 39.5 ± 2.4% to 46.3 ± 1.1%; p ≤ 0.05). Contribution of the upper and lower limbs decreased over the three phases (respectively from 15.7 ± 2.5% to 10.6 ± 0.6% and from 44.8 ± 2.1% to 43.1 ± 1.5%; p ≤ 0.05).

Ramírez-Moreno, Gerardo Presbítero-Espinosa, Ricardo A. Ramírez-Mendoza, Jorge de J. Lozoya-Santos","This work presents a survey literature review on biomechanics, specifically aimed at the study of existent biomechanical tools through video analysis, in order to identify opportunities for researchers in the field, and discuss future proposals and perspectives. Scientific literature (journal papers and conference proceedings) in the field of video-based biomechanics published after 2010 were selected and discussed. The most common application of the study of biomechanics using this technique is sports, where the most reported applications are american football, soccer, basketball, baseball, jumping, among others. These techniques have also been studied in a less proportion, in ergonomy, and injury prevention. From the revised literature, it is clear that biomechanics studies mainly focus on the analysis of angles, speed or acceleration, however, not many studies explore the dynamical forces in the joints. The development of video-based biomechanic tools for force analysis could provide methods for assessment and prediction of biomechanical force associated risks such as injuries and fractures. Therefore, it is convenient to start exploring this field. A few case studies are reported, where force estimation is performed via manual tracking in different scenarios. This demonstration is carried out using conventional manual tracking, however, the inclusion of similar methods in an automated manner could help in the development of intelligent healthcare, force prediction tools for athletes and/or elderly population. Future trends and challenges in this field are also discussed, where data availability and artificial intelligence models will be key to proposing new and more reliable methods for biomechanical analysis.",1
Biomechanical asymmetries differ between autograft types during unplanned change of direction after ACL reconstruction,2022-04-14,2022,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Joshua J. Miles, Polly M. McGuigan, Enda King, Katherine A. J. Daniels","Nine months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, athletes who undergo surgery using a bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft demonstrate higher loading asymmetries during vertical jumping than those with a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. These asymmetries may transfer into sporting movements with a greater ACL injury risk. The aim of this study was to compare between-limb asymmetries in knee mechanics and task performance during an unplanned 90° change-of-direction (CoD) task in male field sport athletes reconstructed with BPTB or HT autografts. Seventy-eight male multidirectional field sport athletes with either a BPTB (n = 39) or HT (n = 39) autograft completed maximal unplanned CoD trials in a three-dimensional motion capture laboratory at approximately 9 months post-surgery. A mixed-model 2x2 ANOVA (autograft type x limb) was used to compare variables related to ACL injury risk (e.g., internal knee moments) and performance (e.g., completion time) between autografts and limbs. Statistical parametric mapping was used for a waveform comparison throughout stance, supplemented with a discrete point analyses of peak knee moments and performance variables. Interaction effects were found at the knee joint, with BPTB demonstrating greater asymmetries than HT in knee extension moment (p < 0.001); resultant ground reaction force (p < 0.001); peak knee external rotation moment (p = 0.04); and knee adduction (p = 0.05), medial rotation (p < 0.001), and flexion (p < 0.001) angles. No differences were found between autografts for any performance variable. BPTB demonstrated greater lower-limb biomechanical asymmetries than HT during CoD, which may influence knee loading and longer-term outcomes and should thus be targeted during rehabilitation prior to return to play.",1

Prevention of Non-Contact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries among Youth Female Athletes: An Umbrella Review,2022-04-12,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Anmol T. Mattu, Brianna Ghali, Vanessa Linton, Alex Zheng, Ian Pike","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries account for a large percentage of knee injuries, disproportionately affecting female athletes. To help health professionals stay current, we performed an umbrella review to evaluate the effectiveness of ACL injury prevention programs in reducing non-contact ACL injury rates, determine the effective components within interventions, and provide clinical recommendations. Twelve databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, SPORTDiscus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PEDro, Web of Science Core Collection, Epistemonikos, TRIP, BC Guidelines and Protocols, CPG Infobase, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global) were searched in May 2021 to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Four databases were searched again in September 2021 to identify recent primary literature. Non-contact ACL injury data were extracted to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and these were combined using an inverse variance random-effects model. A qualitative assessment of included reviews was performed. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) or Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2). Sixteen reviews and two primary studies met the inclusion criteria. Across 11 primary studies, prevention programs were effective in reducing non-contact ACL injuries by 64% (IRR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.18–0.70)). A multi-faceted exercise program, beginning in the pre-season and containing at least three exercise types, may be beneficial in reducing ACL injury risk.",1

Though, the kinematic differences between laboratory and on-field settings have never been investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the lower-limb kinematics of female footballers during agility movements performed both in laboratory and football field environments. Twenty-eight healthy young female talented football (soccer) players (14.9 ± 0.9 years) participated. Lower-limb joint kinematics was collected through wearable inertial sensors (Xsens Link) in three conditions: (1) laboratory setting during unanticipated sidestep cutting at 40-50°; on the football pitch (2) football-specific exercises (F-EX) and (3) football games (F-GAME). A hierarchical two-level random effect model in Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to compare joint kinematics among the conditions. Waveform consistency was investigated through Pearson's correlation coefficient and standardized z-score vector. In-lab kinematics differed from the on-field ones, while the latter were similar in overall shape and peaks. Lower sagittal plane range of motion, greater ankle eversion, and pelvic rotation were found for on-field kinematics (p < 0.044). The largest differences were found during landing and weight acceptance. The biomechanical differences between lab and field settings suggest the application of context-related adaptations in female footballers and have implications in ACL injury prevention strategies.HighlightsTalented youth female football players showed kinematical differences between the lab condition and the on-field ones, thus adopting a context-related motor strategy.Lower sagittal plane range of motion, greater ankle eversion, and pelvic rotation were found on the field. Such differences pertain to the ACL injury mechanism and prevention strategies.Preventative training should support the adoption of non-linear motor learning to stimulate greater self-organization and adaptability.It is recommended to test football players in an ecological environment to improve subsequent primary ACL injury prevention programmes.",1
Biomechanical features of drop vertical jump are different among various sporting activities,2022-04-08,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Kengo Harato, Yutaro Morishige, Shu Kobayashi, Yasuo Niki, Takeo Nagura","Risk for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury can be assessed based on drop vertical jump (DVJ). However, biomechanics of DVJ may differ with various sporting activities. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether biomechanical features of DVJ are different among various sporting activities in female athletes.A total of 42 female athletes, including 25 basketball, 8 soccer and 9 volleyball players, participated in the current investigation. DVJ was done for each female athlete using a three-dimensional motion analysis system which consisted of six cameras, two force plates and 46 retro-reflective markers. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded for both limbs in each athlete. Simultaneously, frontal and sagittal plane views of the DVJ were recorded using two different high-resolution video cameras to evaluate Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) score. Three-dimensional biomechanical parameters at the knee joint and LESS were compared among three different sporting activities using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test after confirming normality assumption. Thereafter post hoc Tukey or Steel-Dwass was utilized for multiple comparison.Soccer players had better LESS score, and peak knee flexion angle was significantly larger in soccer players compared to the other sports. In addition, knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC), peak knee abduction angle, knee internal rotation angle, and knee abduction moment within 40 ms from IC were significantly smaller in soccer players, compared to basketball players. In terms of volleyball players, knee abduction angle at IC and knee internal rotation angle at IC were significantly larger than soccer players, whereas no significant biomechanical differences were found between basketball and volleyball players.From the present study, female basketball and volleyball players have worse LESS score, smaller peak knee flexion angle, greater knee abduction angle at IC and greater knee internal rotation angle at IC, compared to female soccer players. Thus, female basketball and volleyball players may have an increased risk of non-contact ACL injury during the jump-landing task, compared to soccer players. Biomechanics of DVJ depends on characteristics of the athlete's primary sport.",1
Common Sports Injury in Football Players: A Review,2022-04-05,2022,Galore Knowledge Publication Pvt.

The injuries occur during football games and practice due to a combination of high speed and full contact. The authors of different studies showed in their results that the incidence of football injuries a range from 0.5 to 45 injuries per 1000 hours of practice and games. Football injuries most commonly affect the knee and ankle joints, muscles, and ligaments of the thigh and calf. Most commonly affected region is lower extremity with an incidence of 61% to 90%. There are two types of risk factors intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors which are responsible for football injury. We found through this review of literature that ankle injuries are the most common injuries in football players. Other injuries which is also common in football players are such as, ligament of knee, hamstring strain, football concussion, wrist injury.

Neck Loads During Head-First Entries into Trampoline Dismount Foam Pits: Considerations for Trampoline Park Safety,2022-04-05,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,"Tom Whyte, Edward Lind, Adam Richards, David Eager, Lynne E. Bilston, Julie Brown","Serious cervical spine injuries have been documented from falls into foam pits at trampoline parks. To address the lack of evidence on how foam pits should be designed for mitigating neck injury risk, this study aimed to quantify neck loads during head-first entry into varying foam pit designs. An instrumented Hybrid III anthropomorphic test device was dropped head-first from a height of up to 1.5 m into three differently constructed foam pits, each using a different mechanism to prevent direct contact between the falling person and the floor (foam slab, trampoline or net bed). Measured neck loads were compared to published injury reference values. In the simplest, foam-only pit design, increasing foam depth tended to reduce peak compressive force. At least one injury assessment reference metric was exceeded in all pit conditions tested for 1.5 m falls, most commonly the time-dependent neck compression criterion. The results highlight the importance of adequate foam depth in combination with appropriate pit design in minimizing injury risk. The risk of cervical spine injury may not be reduced sufficiently with current foam pit designs.",1

However, normative trunk kinematics during unilateral athletic tasks in a large population of ""healthy"" (no history of ACL injury and no known future ACL injury) women's soccer players have not been well-described. This study's purposes were to describe trunk kinematics in a population of 37 healthy collegiate women's soccer players completing a step-down, a deceleration, and a 90° cut, and to provide a reference for normative values.MethodsA cross-sectional cohort of 37 female soccer players were analysed for this study. Trunk forward flexion and lateral flexion were measured relative to the pelvis, and trunk centre of mass position was measured relative to the proximal tibia. Trunk kinematics were characterized by individual values at key events during the tasks and time-series curves normalized to 100% of the time.ResultsParticipants demonstrated increasing trunk forward flexion with increasing knee flexion angle, small amounts of increasing ipsilateral trunk flexion with increasing peak knee abduction moment, and trunk centre of mass position that moved medially during the deceleration and cut tasks. Additionally, participants demonstrated peak trunk lateral flexion angles milliseconds before peak knee flexion angle.ConclusionThis study provides a reference for identifying aberrant trunk mechanics that may increase the risk for non-contact ACL injury.Level of evidenceLevel II.",1

It remains unknown if at the time that athletes are cleared to RTS, they exhibit between-limb symmetry in ACL and tibiofemoral contact forces or if these forces are comparable with those in uninjured athletes.To (1) examine ACL and tibiofemoral contact forces in athletes who underwent ACLR and were cleared to RTS and (2) compare the involved leg to the healthy contralateral leg and healthy controls during functional tasks.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.A total of 26 male athletes who underwent ACLR were tested at the time of RTS during tasks that included single-leg vertical, horizontal, and side jumps; cutting maneuvers; and high-intensity running. We used an electromyography-constrained musculoskeletal modeling workflow to estimate ACL and tibiofemoral contact forces and compared the results with those of 23 healthy male participants.The ACLR group presented no differences in peak tibiofemoral contact forces in the involved limb compared with the control group. However, there were significant between-limb differences mainly due to higher contact forces in the uninvolved (healthy) limb of the ACLR group compared with the control group. In the ACLR group, ACL forces were significantly higher in the uninvolved limb compared with the involved limb during cutting and running. Lateral contact forces were lower in the involved compared with the uninvolved limb, with large effect sizes during cutting (d = 1.14; P < .001) and running (d = 1.10; P < .001).Current discharge criteria for clearance to RTS after ACLR did not ensure the restoration of symmetric loading in our cohort of male athletes. ACL force asymmetry was observed during cutting and running, in addition to knee loading asymmetries on several tasks tested.",1

Reliability and Differences Between Sexes in Landing Mechanics when Performing the Lateral Bound Test,2022-04-01,2022,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,"Andy Waldhelm, Sydney Allen, Lacy Grand, Carolyn Bopp, Kristian Foster, Ginger Muckridge, Neil Schwarz","Background and Purpose Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are prevalent among the athletic population, imposing a heavy economic burden, and the risk of re-injury. Most current biomechanical screening tasks are performed in the sagittal plane, and there is a need for more screening tools that assess sports specific movements in the frontal plane. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of and examine differences between sexes in the performance of the Lateral Bound Test (LBT). Materials/Methods Each subject performed three trials of a LBT which included jumping laterally from one leg over a hurdle and landing on the opposite leg. Two cameras were placed six feet from the landing marker. Maximum dynamic knee valgus using the frontal plane projection angle and knee flexion angle at initial contact and maximal knee flexion were measured upon landing leg using 2D video analysis software. Additionally, video of 10 individuals’ trials were analyzed twice with one week between the analyses to obtain intra-rater reliability while 12 participants were retested one week later to determine test-retest reliability. Results Thirty healthy subjects, 16 males, 14 females participated. Intra-rater reliability was determined to be excellent for all variables (ICC&gt;0.96). In contrast, the test-retest reliability had greater disparity. Test-retest reliability ranged from poor (ICC = 0.47) to excellent (ICC &gt; 0.90). Significant differences existed between the sexes, including males being significantly taller, weighing more, and demonstrating greater bilateral dynamic knee valgus (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences existed between sexes for knee flexion angles. Conclusion The new LBT had excellent intra-rater reliability for assessing dynamic knee valgus and initial and maximum knee flexion angle when performing a functional movement in the frontal plane. Furthermore, males landed with more dynamic knee valgus than females which is contradictory to what has been observed with functional screening tools performed in the sagittal plane.

Different exercise interventions have been conducted to improve DKV. Extensive research and meta-objective analysis were conducted to assess how exercise interventions affected people with lower extremity functional indicators of DKV. Methods: The electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, Google Scholar, and Iranian databases SID and Magiran were systematically searched from inception to September 2021. Only full-text articles published in English/Persian peer-reviewed journals that met this study criterion were tracked. Two researchers evaluated the methodological quality of research findings separately, employing the Downs and Black Checklist. After collecting significant data from eligible studies, the results were integrated by applying a random-effects meta-analysis approach. Results: The final systematic review and meta-analysis comprised seven of the 3470 papers deemed potentially relevant.

Biomechanical Load Quantification Using a Lower Extremity Inertial Sensor Setup During Football Specific Activities,2022-03-28,2022,Informa UK Limited,Sports Biomechanics,"Bram J.C. Bastiaansen, Riemer J.K. Vegter, E. Wilmes, Cornelis J. de Ruiter, Koen A.P.M. Lemmink, Michel S. Brink","Training load monitoring systems in football do not focus on lower extremities and therefore potentially neglect important information to optimise performance or reduce injury risk. The current study aims to present joint and segment angular accelerations as novel indicators to quantify lower extremity biomechanical load measured by a new inertial sensor setup. Relationships were explored with commonly used whole-body training load indicators using principal component analysis (PCA). Sixteen male amateur football players performed a linear sprint and an agility T-test. An inertial sensor setup, and local position measurement system were used to collect training load data. Hip Load, Knee Load, Thigh Load and Shank Load were introduced to quantify lower extremity biomechanical load. Three principal components were identified for both tests, explaining 91% and 86% of the variance. The indicators for the lower extremities contributed to the second principal component for both tests and provide distinct information compared to whole-body load indicators. The results show the potential to use an inertial sensor setup combined with common monitoring systems to evaluate training load, which may help optimise future performance and reduce injury risk. These relationships should be further examined during other football specific activities such as shooting or jumping.",1

Agility in Invasion Sports: Position Stand of the IUSCA,2022-03-25,2022,International Universities Strength and Conditioning Association,International Journal of Strength and Conditioning,"Warren Young, Tom Dos'Santos, Damian Harper, Ian Jefferys, Scott Talpey","Agility is a complex skill that is influenced by several physical, technical and cognitive factors. In this position stand, we discuss agility as it relates to invasion sports such as the many football codes. An important concept when conceptualising agility is understanding how it is applied on the field or court. Agility is particularly important in contests between attackers and defenders. For example, an attacker needs to create space or separation from defenders, in order to evade or to maintain possession of the ball. Conversely, defenders may require agility to reduce time and space in relation to the attacker, thereby applying pressure with the intention of achieving a turnover of possession. The movements performed in an agility scenario are diverse, and may involve an isolated deceleration, or a range of actions to produce a lateral displacement of the body at various angles and speeds. To create novel insights into agility, the interactions between predators and prey are explored in the animal world and reveal that successful pursuit (like a defender) or escape (like an attacker) is influenced by the ability to accelerate and attain high speeds, decelerate, and manoeuvre with control at optimum speeds, as well as expressing perceptual and cognitive skills. A plethora of sports literature claiming to discuss agility actually refers to pre-planned change-of-direction (COD) movements, known as COD ability. There are several differences between agility and COD ability, which should be considered when testing and prescribing agility activities. The characteristics of different agility techniques are presented and discussed with consideration to performance and the risk of injury such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, with the aim of creating multiple movement solutions for the athlete. Due to the diversity of agility actions performed in invasion sports, physical development should include tissue strengthening as well as fast and slow stretch-shortening cycle exercises to cater for different speeds and angles of agility movements. The speed and accuracy of decision-making in agility contests (cognitive component) are determined by the athlete’s ability to anticipate opponent’s actions, visually scan the environment, recognise patterns of play, and predict movement strategies based on knowledge of situations. One versus one contests, small-sided games, and video perceptual training can enhance the cognitive component of agility. Finally, there is no single coaching strategy or method that should be used to develop agility. Instead, the appropriate methodology must fit the individual needs of athletes, and therefore a mixed multicomponent approach is needed as part of an agility framework. Training examples to develop agility are presented throughout this position statement.",1
Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis Discriminates Aerobic Power in Futsal Players: The Role of Body Composition,2022-03-25,2022,MDPI AG,Biology,"Catarina N. Matias, Francesco Campa, Giuseppe Cerullo, Giuseppe D’Antona, Rita Giro, João Faleiro, Joana F. Reis, Cristina P. Monteiro, Maria J. Valamatos, Filipe J. Teixeira","Aims: The present study aimed to assess the ability of bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) in discriminating fitness levels in futsal players, exploring the association of body composition and bioelectrical parameters with aerobic power. Methods: Forty-eight professional futsal players (age 23.8 ± 5.3 years) were involved in a cross-sectional study during their pre-season phase. Fat mass (FM) and muscle mass were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. VO2max was obtained by indirect calorimetry through a graded exercise test performed on a treadmill. Bioelectrical resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and phase angle (PhA) were directly measured using a foot-to-hand bioimpedance technology at a 50 kHz frequency. Bioelectric R and Xc were standardized for the participants’ height and used to plot the bioimpedance vector in the R-Xc graph according to the BIVA approach. Results: The participants divided into groups of VO2max limited by tertiles showed significant differences in mean vector position in the R-Xc graph (p &lt; 0.001), where a higher VO2max resulted in a longer vector and upper positioning. FM, muscle mass, and PhA differed (p &lt; 0.01) among the athletes grouped by tertiles of VO2max, where athletes with a greater aerobic power showed a lower percentage of FM and a higher percentage of muscle mass and PhA. FM and PhA were associated with VO2max (FM: r = −0.658, p &lt; 0.001; PhA: r = 0.493, p &lt; 0.001). These relationships remained significant after adjusting for age and body mass (FM: ß = −0.335, p = 0.046; PhA: ß = 0.351, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Bioelectrical impedance vectors positioned on the lower pole of the R-Xc graph identified futsal players with a lower VO2max, while longer vectors corresponded to a greater aerobic power. Additionally, PhA, that describes the vector direction, was positively associated with VO2max, while a higher FM negatively affected VO2max in the futsal players. BIVA and PhA evaluation may represent a valid support for screening the aerobic fitness level in professional futsal players, when more sophisticated assessment methods are not available.",1

Thinking through making and doing: sport science as an art of inquiry,2022-03-24,2022,Informa UK Limited,"Sport, Education and Society","Carl T. Woods, Keith Davids","How best to summarise the professional work of sport scientists? What if we were to view them as artisans? As enskiled crafts-persons who think through and with their materials? What implications would this idea have for how we take up with research and ensuing scientific methods? Here, we explore these philosophical questions – of applied relevance – through Ingold's process of making. From this perspective, skilled artisans like potters, basket-makers and sport scientists, think through making and doing, as opposed to make and do through thinking. Where the latter imposes form onto matter by way of conceptualisation, the former goes along with materials in active participation, corresponding with what such things have to say with a skilled attentiveness and selective responsiveness. We argue that the implications of these propositions for research in sport science are profound; encouraging a progression from the traditional hypothetico-deductive theory of scientific method (make and do through thinking), towards an art of inquiry (think through making and doing). In the former, phenomena are studied about, (re)producing categorical (sub-)disciplinary knowledge by way of vertical integration, while in the latter, phenomena are studied with, growing storied knowledge of by way of correspondence. These arguments are not to be construed as a call for more 'qualitative research' within the sport sciences, but rather to underline the value of situating participant observation at the core of one's inquiry. Through a prologue and epilogue, we exemplify our arguments in the very process of this paper's becoming – detailing the careful attentiveness and selective responsiveness to the various invitations to write, emergent while thinking through making and doing.",1
Development and Validation of a New Anisotropic Visco-Hyperelastic Human Head Finite Element Model Capable of Predicting Multiple Brain Injuries,2022-03-24,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Ding Lyu, Runzhou Zhou, Chin-hsu Lin, Priya Prasad, Liying Zhang","This paper reports on the latest refinement of the Finite Element Global Human Body Models Consortium 50th percentile (GHBMC M50) adult male head model by the development and incorporation of a new material model into the white matter tissue of the brain. The white matter is represented by an anisotropic visco-hyperelastic material model capable of simulating direction-dependent response of the brain tissue to further improve the bio-fidelity and injury predictive capability of the model. The parameters representing the material were optimized by comparing model responses to seven experimentally reported strain responses of brains of postmortem human subjects (PMHS) subjected to head impact. The head model was subjected to rigorous validation against experimental data on force-deflection responses in the skull and face, intracranial pressure, and brain strain responses from over 34 PMHS head impact experiments. Crash-induced injury indices (CIIs) for facial bone fracture, skull fracture, cerebral contusion, acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs), and diffuse brain injury were developed by reconstructing 32 PMHS and real-world injury cases with the model. Model predicted maximum principal strain (MPS) and stress were determined as fracture CIIs for compact bone and spongy bones, respectively, in the skull and face. Brain responses in terms of MPS, MPS rates, and pressure distribution in injury producing experimental impacts were determined using the model and analyzed with logistic regression and survival analysis to develop CIIs for brain contusions, diffuse brain injuries, and ASDH. The statistical models using logistic regression and survival analysis showed high accuracy with area under the receiver operating curve greater than 0.8. Because of lack of sufficient moderate diffuse brain injury data, a statistical model was not created, but all indications are that the MPS rate is an essential brain response that discriminates between moderate and severe brain injuries. The authors stated that the current GHBMC M50 v.6.0 is an advanced tool for injury prediction and mitigation of injuries in automotive crashes, sports, recreational, and military environments.",1

In this context, the Y Balance Test (YBT) is presented as a tool to assess dynamic postural control.This study aimed to explore the differences and possible correlations in the YBT scores and inter-limb asymmetry for anterior (ANT), posteromedial (PM) and posterolateral (PL) directions by category and field position in soccer players.173 males soccer players aged between 14 and 33 years old agreed to participate. Five categories and six field position were considered in this study. A standardised protocol was used at multiple clubs during the pre-season assessment of musculoskeletal function in soccer players. All the players performed the Y Balance Test (YBT) (official YBT Kit), assessing the dominant and non-dominant leg for three YBT directions (anterior-AN, posteromedial-PM and posterolateral-PL), inter-limb asymmetry and composite score.For AN, amateur and semiprofessional obtained the highest values for Dominant and Non-Dominant legs (Rangemean = 101.8-109.4%) and the lowest level in PRO players (mean: 62.0%). Concerning PM-PL, semiprofessional (Rangemean = 126.4-132.7%, dominant and non-Dominant respectively), followed by professional and amateur reported higher scores compared to youth categories. Inter-limb asymmetry showed higher values in lower age categories. The best composite scores were detected in semiprofessionals (Rangemean = 113.3-126.7% for dominant and Rangemean = 113.8-129.7% for non-Dominant leg), compared with the rest of the categories and for each field position evaluated.Comparisons between field-positions revealed that centre-backs were worse than wingers and forwards. In order to explain variations in dynamic balance between competitive levels within the same age-group, special considerations about training programmes and related co-variables should be considered.",1
Visual–Spatial Attentional Performance Identifies Lower Extremity Injury Risk in Adolescent Athletes,2022-03-23,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,"Jason M.

Emergent evidence suggests that cognitive and oculomotor performance may also contribute to LEMSK injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prospective cognitive and oculomotor measures identify adolescent athletes who sustain an in-season LEMSK injury.Prospective longitudinal study.Controlled laboratory and athletic event settings.Four hundred eighty-eight adolescent male football and female soccer athletes aged 13 to 18 years.Preseason baseline cognitive and oculomotor performance: Attention Network Task (ANT), cued task switching, King-Devick test, and near point of convergence.Incidence of LEMSK sprains and strains during a single competitive season.Attention Network Task-orienting network reaction time (RT) was the only cognitive or oculomotor measure significantly associated with LEMSK injury [B = 1.015, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.024, P < 0.01]. Every 10 milliseconds increase in orienting network RT was associated with a 15% increased risk for LEMSK injury. Athletes demonstrating an orienting network RT ≥ 32.8 milliseconds had a higher risk for LEMSK injury relative to athletes below the cut-point (relative risk, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.52-4.52; odds ratio, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.63-5.52).Deficits in visual-spatial components of attention were associated with 2.62 times greater risk for LEMSK injury in adolescent athletes. The present results add evidence to suggest that visual-spatial attentional processing contributes to LEMSK injury and may supplement previously established LEMSK injury risk assessments.",1
Biomechanical of lower extremity athletic stress and its relationship with performance effectiveness of compound skills for Soccer junior players,2022-03-22,2022,Egypts Presidential Specialized Council for Education and Scientific Research,The International Scientific Journal of Physical Education and Sport Sciences,Hamada Habib,"This research aims to identify the impact of athletic stress on the biomechanics of the movements of the joints in the lower extremity during performing compound skills by the junior soccer player.The researcher used the descriptive method through using kinematographic analysis.The research was applied to a sample of ( 6) junior soccer players selected intentionally from Mansoura Sports Club.The researcher used the following physical tests: Standing Balance Test -Illinois Agility Test -Quadrant Jump Test -Vertical Jump Test Isometric Leg Strength Test, in order to identify the level of stress in addition to skill tests as well (receive&kick).This study used kinematographic analysis by using Simi Motion System.The researcher used the pre-and post-measurement before and directly after the match and before the players could recover.The most important results were that the averages values of the biomechanical variables and the physical measurements confirm a decrease in the post-measurement test than the pre-measurements in all the skill performance phases.Also, the time of performing the two skills under study was shorter in the pre-measurements, which confirms in general that the research sample was significantly influenced by stress.There is a significant correlation between the physical and the biomechanical variables expressing stress.In addition, there is a correlation between physical and biomechanical variables and the skill performance phases in terms of post-measurement, which influences the effectiveness of the skillful performance skills in soccer for the research sample.",1
Lower limb risk prevention in athletes: evaluation and strategies,2022-03-20,2022,Medimay Communication,International Journal of Bone Fragility,"Umile Giuseppe Longo, Rocco Papalia, Sergio De Salvatore, Alessandra Greco, Martina Marino, Marco Bravi, Fabio Santacaterina, Vincenzo Denaro","Risk prevention of sports-related lower limb musculoskeletal injuries in adult and youth athletes is an important topic encompassing health and economic factors. For example, muscle injuries in professional football players could expose these athletes to recurrence, creating a significant economic problem for the football club. Such observations have led to the development of prevention programs, predominantly exercise-based injury prevention strategies, which may be multi-component or single-component. These programs focus on intrinsic risk factors, such as strength deficits, lack of flexibility, poor balance, coordination, endurance, previous injury, body size, anatomical alignment issues, foot shape, age, and sex. The FIFA 11+ program is an important example of an exercise-based program. It was developed under the leadership of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association with the aim of evaluating and, where necessary, implementing preventive training routines for soccer players. Despite the program being designed for soccer players, it has shown efficacy in other sports too. Many studies also emphasize the importance of identifying and avoiding extrinsic risk factors related to type and level of activity, shoe type, bracing equipment, etc. Understanding of the incidence, the severity, and the etiology of a specific injury is required in order to provide adequate prevention measures and to reduce the need for surgery. The present study focuses explicitly on identifying and evaluating possible interventions for lower limb injuries.",1

The aim of the present study was to systematically identify original studies that applied machine learning (ML) to soccer data, highlighting current possibilities in ML and future applications. A systematic review of PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and FECYT (Web of Sciences, CCC, DIIDW, KJD, MEDLINE, RSCI, and SCIELO) was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. From the 145 studies initially identified, 32 were fully reviewed, and their outcome measures were extracted and analyzed. In summary, all articles were clustered into three groups: injury (n = 7); performance (n = 21), which was classified in match/league outcomes forecasting, physical/physiological forecasting, and technical/tactical forecasting; and the last group was about talent forecasting (n = 5). The development of technology, and subsequently the large amount of data available, has become ML in an important strategy to help team staff members in decision-making predicting dose-response relationship reducing the chaotic nature of this team sport. However, since ML models depend upon the amount of dataset, further studies should analyze the amount of data input needed make to a relevant predictive attempt which makes accurate predicting available.",1
EFFECTS OF A PROPHYLACTIC KNEE SLEEVE ON THE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT AND LOWER EXTREMITY BIOMECHANICS: AN EXAMINATION USING MUSCULOSKELETAL SIMULATION,2022-03-17,2022,World Scientific Pub Co Pte Ltd,Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology,"JONATHAN SINCLAIR, NIAMH GRIMSHAW, OWEN LATHAM, PAUL JOHN TAYLOR, NACHIAPPAN CHOCKALINGAM","The current study aimed using a two-experiment musculoskeletal simulation-based approach, measuring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) biomechanics, knee joint kinematics, and lower extremity joint loading to examine the effects of both a prophylactic knee sleeve on (1) a sport-specific change of direction movement in female footballers and (2) a single leg landing in male footballers. Experiment 1 examined 12 female university first team level footballers (age [Formula: see text] years, height [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m, body mass [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]kg) undertaking a [Formula: see text] cutting movement in sleeve and no-sleeve conditions. Experiment 2 examined 10 male university first team level footballers (age [Formula: see text] years, height [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m, body mass [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]kg) undertaking a single leg drop jump landing in sleeve and no-sleeve conditions. In each experiment, data was collected in a biomechanics laboratory and three-dimensional (3D) motion capture and ground reaction force (GRF) information was collected. 3D kinematics, 3D knee kinetics, and ACL ligament forces/strains were measured using musculoskeletal simulation, and participants were also asked to subjectively rate the knee sleeve in terms of both comfort and stability. Experiment 1 showed that the sleeve condition was associated with greater ACL strain ([Formula: see text]% and no-[Formula: see text]%) and forces ([Formula: see text] BW and no-[Formula: see text] BW). In addition, the brace condition also enhanced lateral compressive tibiofemoral ([Formula: see text] BW and no-[Formula: see text] BW) and total compressive tibiofemoral force ([Formula: see text] BW and no-[Formula: see text] BW). Finally, for the subjective ratings, participants indicated that the knee sleeve significantly improved perceived comfort and stability. Experiment 2 did not reveal any statistical differences between knee sleeve and no-sleeve conditions nor any effects of the knee sleeve on subjective ratings of comfort or stability. Therefore, the findings from the current investigation suggest that the prophylactic knee sleeve examined in the current investigation does not appear to reduce the biomechanical parameters linked to the aetiology of knee pathologies in male/female footballers.",1
Biomechanical Analysis and Training Method Research on Head Shot Strength of Football Players,2022-03-15,2022,Wiley,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,"Yipeng Yao, Shanshan Xiang","With the development of intelligent sports in China and the rapid improvement of the strength of colleges and universities, the reform of traditional football players' header shooting training methods is becoming more and more urgent in order to solve some problems in the development of sports and speed up the intelligent training of Chinese football players. Based on this, this paper studies the biomechanical analysis and training method based on the integration of header strength data of football players. A dynamic header tracking model of football players based on a local search algorithm is designed. The data collection is realized from the aspects of athletes' header shooting training, skill improvement, physical consumption, and trajectory. The biological data of header shooting power is comprehensively analyzed and evaluated by using a local search algorithm. The results show that the training system based on a local search algorithm has the advantages of high feasibility, high data accuracy, and fast response speed. It can effectively conduct accurate guidance and improve the shooting accuracy according to the biological characteristics of header shooting intensity. This paper studies the biological analysis and training method of header strength of football players based on a local search algorithm. This has certain reference significance for accelerating the construction of intelligent training of Chinese football players.",1
A Narrative Review of the Current State of Extended Reality Technology and How it can be Utilised in Sport,2022-03-14,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Peter Le Noury, Remco Polman, Michael Maloney, Adam Gorman","Abstract Extended reality is an umbrella term used to describe three computer-generated technologies including virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality. Extended reality is an emerging technology that has been utilised in many high-performance domains including psychology, medicine and the military, with the aim of enhancing perceptual-cognitive skills and motor skills. However, the use of extended reality in sport, particularly at the elite level, has only recently started to receive attention. While the growth of extended reality technology continues to accelerate at a rapid rate, empirical evidence aimed at understanding how these devices can best be applied in high-performance sport has not followed suit. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide clarity for high-performance sport organisations, researchers, sport scientists, coaches and athletes about the current state of extended reality technology and how it has been utilised in sport. In doing so, we first define and give examples of the types of extended reality technology including virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality that are available at the present time. Second, we detail how skill acquisition principles underpinned by the theoretical framework of ecological dynamics can be used to help inform the design and assessment of extended reality training tools. Third, we describe how extended reality has been utilised in sport, including how extended reality tools have been assessed for their level of representativeness, and the effectiveness of extended reality training interventions for improving perceptual-cognitive skills and motor skills. Finally, we discuss the future utilisation of extended reality in sport, including the key learnings that can be drawn from other domains, future research directions, practical applications and areas for consideration related to the use of extended reality for training skills in sport.",1
Methodological Procedures for Non-Linear Analyses of Physiological and Behavioural Data in Football,2022-03-14,2022,IntechOpen,Exercise Physiology,"José E. Teixeira, Pedro Forte, Ricardo Ferraz, Luís Branquinho, António J. Silva, Tiago M. Barbosa, António M. Monteiro","Complex and dynamic systems are characterised by emergent behaviour, self-similarity, self-organisation and a chaotic component. In team sports as football, complexity and non-linear dynamics includes understanding the mechanisms underlying human movement and collective behaviour. Linear systems approaches in this kind of sports may limit performance understanding due to the fact that small changes in the inputs may not represent proportional and quantifiable changes in the output. Thus, non-linear approaches have been applied to assess training and match outcomes in football. The increasing access to wearable and tracking technology provides large datasets, enabling the analyses of time-series related to different performance indicators such as physiological and positional parameters. However, it is important to frame the theoretical concepts, mathematical models and procedures to determine metrics with physiological and behavioural significance. Additionally, physiological and behavioural data should be considered to determine the complexity and non-linearity of the system in football. Thus, the current chapter summarises the main methodological procedures to extract positional data using non-linear analyses such as entropy scales, relative phase transforms, non-linear indexes, cross correlation, fractals and clustering methods.",1

Demographic and injury history details were also collected. Footballers were subsequently followed for 18 months for ACL injury.Fifteen noncontact ACL injuries occurred during the follow-up period. Prior ACL injury (odds ratio [OR], 9.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.67-31.46), a lower isometric hip adductor to abductor strength ratio (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.09-3.61), greater CMJ peak take-off force (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.09-3.61), and greater single-leg triple vertical hop average dynamic knee valgus (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.06-3.63) and ipsilateral trunk flexion (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01-2.55) were independently associated with an increased risk of subsequent ACL injury. A multivariable prediction model consisting of CMJ peak take-off force, dynamic knee valgus, and ACL injury history that was internally validated classified ACL injured from uninjured footballers with 78% total accuracy. Between-leg asymmetry in lower limb strength and CMJ kinetics were not associated with subsequent ACL injury risk.Preseason field-based measures of lower limb muscle strength and biomechanics were associated with future noncontact ACL injury in elite female footballers. These risk factors can be used to guide ACL injury screening practices and inform the design of targeted injury prevention training in elite female footballers.",1
Body Pose Estimation Integrated With Notational Analysis: A New Approach to Analyze Penalty Kicks Strategy in Elite Football,2022-03-10,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Guilherme de Sousa Pinheiro, Xing Jin, Varley Teoldo Da Costa, Martin Lames","Body orientation of football players has proven to be an informative resource related to successful penalty kicks. OpenPose is one of the most popular open-source pose estimation technologies. This study aims: (i) to verify whether OpenPose can detect relevant body orientation angles from video data of penalty kicks in elite football and (ii) to investigate the relationship between these body angles and observable behaviors analyzed via an observational system for penalty kick analysis in football (OSPAF) with the penalty taker and goalkeeper strategy. A total of 34 penalty videos, with standardized viewing angle, from the main European leagues (2017–2020) were analyzed. Relevant body orientation variables were selected for penalty kicks analysis and were extracted from video data through OpenPose technique. The OSPAF, previously validated by experts, was used. The mean confidence score of OpenPose measures was 0.80 ± 0.14. OpenPose Retest reliability values was 0.976 ± 0.03. Logistic regressions were performed to investigate the relationship between OpenPose investigated variables (penalty taker: shoulder, hips, and nonkicking foot orientation; goalkeeper: right and left foot, anticipation), observable behaviors (OSPAF variables), and the strategy (penalty taker: goalkeeper dependent or independent; goalkeeper: shooter dependent or independent) in penalty kicks. The selected body orientation angle (goalkeeper anticipation) measured through OpenPose correlated significantly with the goalkeeper strategy. The prediction model of the goalkeeper's strategy had its accuracy increased to 97% when the variable goalkeeper anticipation was included [ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=""false"">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>35</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=""false"">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = 49.648, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. Lower degrees of goalkeeper anticipation, the goalkeeper tactical action (awaiting), and run up speed (slow) were associated with a kicker-dependent strategy. Regarding the penalty taker, the selected body angles measured through OpenPose did not associate significantly with the shooter strategy. Body orientation analysis by using OpenPose has shown sufficient reliability and provides practical applications for analyzing the strategies adopted by goalkeepers in penalty kicks in elite football.",1

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown.To determine the relationship between brain activation and biomechanical changes after NMT with biofeedback.Cohort study.Research laboratory.Twenty female high school soccer athletes, with 10 in an augmented NMT group and 10 in a control (no training) group.Ten participants completed 6 weeks of NMT augmented with real-time biofeedback to reduce knee injury-risk movements, and 10 participants pursued no training. Augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) was implemented with visual biofeedback that responded in real time to injury-risk biomechanical variables. A drop vertical jump with 3-dimensional motion capture was used to assess injury-risk neuromuscular changes before and after the 6-week intervention. Brain-activation changes were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during unilateral knee and multijoint motor tasks.After aNMT, sensory (precuneus), visual-spatial (lingual gyrus), and motor-planning (premotor) brain activity increased for knee-specific movement; sensorimotor cortex activity for multijoint movement decreased. The knee-abduction moment during landing also decreased (4.66 ± 5.45 newton meters; P = .02; Hedges g = 0.82) in the aNMT group but did not change in the control group (P > .05). The training-induced increased brain activity with isolated knee movement was associated with decreases in knee-abduction moment (r = 0.67; P = .036) and sensorimotor cortex activity for multijoint movement (r = 0.87; P = .001). No change in brain activity was observed in the control group (P > .05).The relationship between neural changes observed across tasks and reduced knee abduction suggests that aNMT facilitated recruitment of sensory integration centers to support reduced injury-risk mechanics and improve sensorimotor neural efficiency for multijoint control. Further research is warranted to determine if this training-related multimodal neuroplasticity enhances neuromuscular control during more complex sport-specific activities.",1

Preventing motor coordination errors requires neural sensorimotor integration activity to support knee-joint neuromuscular control, but the underlying neural mechanisms driving injury-risk motor control are not well understood.To evaluate brain activity differences for knee sensorimotor control between athletes with high or low injury-risk mechanics.Case-control study.Research laboratory.Of 38 female high school soccer players screened, 10 were selected for analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging compliance, injury-risk classification via 3-dimensional biomechanics during a drop vertical jump, and matching criteria to complete neuroimaging during knee motor tasks.Peak knee-abduction moment during landing was used for group allocation into the high (≥21.74 newton meters [Nm], n = 9) or low (≤10.6 Nm, n = 11) injury-risk classification (n = 11 uncategorized, n = 7 who were not compliant with magnetic resonance imaging). Ten participants (5 high risk, 5 low risk) with adequate data were matched and compared across 2 neuroimaging paradigms: unilateral knee-joint control and unilateral multijoint leg press against resistance.Athletes with high injury-risk biomechanics had less neural activity in 1 sensory-motor cluster for isolated knee-joint control (precuneus, peak Z score = 4.14, P ≤ .01, 788 voxels) and greater brain activity for the multijoint leg press in 2 cognitive-motor clusters: the frontal cortex (peak Z score = 4.71, P < .01, 1602 voxels) and posterior cingulate gyrus (peak Z score = 4.43, P < .01, 725 voxels) relative to the low injury-risk group.The high injury-risk group's lower relative engagement of neural sensory resources controlling the knee joint may elevate demand on cognitive motor resources to control loaded multijoint action. The neural activity profile in the high injury-risk group may manifest as a breakdown in neuromuscular coordination, resulting in elevated knee-abduction moments during landing.",1

Lower limb length was associated with the front block-starting line distance ([FB/SL], partial correlation [rPC] = 0.48) and was a significant predictor of FB/SL (R2 = 0.39). The FB/SL was associated with front hip angle (rPC = 0.38), which was consequently associated with numerous kinetic variables during block clearance (rPC from -0.41 to -0.61).

EFFECT OF OUTSOLE THICKNESS ON RUNNING BIOMECHANICS,2022-03-07,2022,Univ. of Malaya,Malaysian Journal of Science,"Chan Siow Cheng, Koh Wei Lin, Tan Yin Qing","Running shoes with increased or decreased sole thickness are postulated to improve running performance, besides to protect runners against high impact forces and running injuries. However, there is no evidence showing that running shoe developments emerging on the market help tackle running injuries. In this study, we compared the effect of different outsole thicknesses: (i) barefoot, (ii) minimalist and (iii) maximalist sports shoes on running biomechanics. Fifteen male subjects (age 23.19 ± 0.73 years old) who had regular exercises for at least 75 minutes per week were recruited to participate in this study. Participants had completed three minutes of running on a treadmill in each condition. Lower extremity kinetics and kinematics were analysed. There was no difference between maximalist running shoes and minimalist running shoes with respect to maximum vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) (p = 0.221), step length (p = 0.50) and cadence (p = 0.30). In addition, we observed longer ground contact time in maximalist running shoes (1.087 ± 0.115 s) when compared with minimalist running shoes (1.051 ± 0.105 s) (p = 0.007). On the other hand, runners had significantly higher knee flexion and adduction in minimalist shoes than maximalist shoes (p = 0.046). In conclusion, running in minimalist shoes, at least in a short period, produces greater running efficiency with shorter ground contact time but may result in a higher injury risk at the knee joint.",1
Anatomical and Neuromuscular Factors Associated to Non-Contact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,2022-03-03,2022,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Marc Dauty, Vincent Crenn, Bastien Louguet, Jérôme Grondin, Pierre Menu, Alban Fouasson-Chailloux","The majority of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur during non-contact mechanisms. Knowledge of the risk factors would be relevant to help prevent athletes' injuries. We aimed to study risk factors associated with non-contact ACL injuries in a population of athletes after ACL reconstruction. From a cohort of 307 athletes, two populations were compared according to the non-contact or contact mechanism of ACL injury. Gender, age and body mass index (BMI) were reported. Passive knee alignment (valgus and extension), knee laxity (KT-1000 test), and isokinetic knee strength were measured on the non-injured limb. The relationship between these factors and the non-contact sport mechanism was established with models using logistic regression analysis for the population and after selection of gender and cut-offs of age, BMI and knee laxity calculated from Receiver Operating Characteristics curve area and Youden index. Age, BMI, antero-posterior laxity, isokinetic knee strength, passive knee valgus and passive knee extension were associated with non-contact ACL injury. According to the multivariate model, a non-contact ACL injury was associated with non-modifiable factors, age (OR: 1.05; p = 0.001), passive knee extension (OR: 1.14; p = 0.001), and with one modifiable factor (Hamstring strength: OR: 0.27; p = 0.01). For women, only passive knee valgus was reported (OR: 1.27; p = 0.01). Age, passive knee extension and weak Hamstring strength were associated with a non-contact ACL injury. Hamstring strengthening could be proposed to prevent ACL injury in young male athletes or in case of knee laxity.",1

"Comparison of ankle force, mobility, flexibility, and plantar pressure values in athletes according to foot posture index",2022-03-01,2022,Baycinar Tibbi Yayincilik,Turkish Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,"Hülya Kalender, Kubilay Uzuner, Deniz Şimşek, İsmail Bayram","This study aims to compare ankle force, mobility, flexibility, and plantar pressure distribution of athletes according to foot posture index (FPI).Between September 2016 and May 2018, a total of 70 volunteer male athletes (mean age: 21.1±2.3 years; range, 18 to 25 years) were included. The athletes were divided into three groups according to their FPI as follows: having supinated feet (Group 1, n=16), neutral/normal feet (Group 2, n=36), or pronated feet (Group 3, n=18). Ankle range of motion (ROM), muscle flexibility, ankle joint strength, and plantar pressure distribution were measured.There were significant differences among the three groups in both right and left ankle dorsiflexion ROM (p=0.009 and p=0.003, respectively). Group 1 had significantly smaller dorsiflexion ROM than the other groups. Group 1 also showed significantly less flexibility in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles than the other foot posture groups. Groups 2 and 3 exhibited significant differences in the maximum torque (p=0.018), maximum work (p=0.008), and total work (p=0.008) of the right plantar flexor muscles at 60°/sec angular velocity. Peak pressure measurements of the right foot were higher in Group 1, compared to Groups 2 and 3 (p<0.001).The results of this study may help to enhance athletic performance by providing a guide for designing training programs appropriate for athletes with different foot types to address their specific muscle flexibility and strength deficiencies.",1
DIFFERENCES IN PRE-SEASON BIOMECHANICAL AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES BETWEEN INJURED AND NON-INJURED FEMALE SOCCER PLAYERS,2022-03-01,2022,Fundacja Rehasport Clinic,"Issues of Rehabilitation, Orthopaedics, Neurophysiology and Sport Promotion – IRONS","Jakub Cichocki, Monika Grygorowicz","Aim To verify whether there is a difference in the value of pre-season biomechanical and functional tests scored by injured and uninjured players. Material and methods 46 female players of a football academy took part in the pre-season biomechanical and functional evaluation including isokinetic tests, functional tests, fundamental movement screen tests, and postural stability tests (Biodex, FMS, Optojump, Delos), and then completed an online questionnaire reporting their injuries in the last round of the season. Results Out of 46 participants, 18 participants (19 injuries) suffered injuries in the area of the lower limbs. There was a difference between the groups (non-injured vs. injured) in the results of anthropometric measurements: age (13.0 vs. 25.0, p = 0.001), height (159 cm vs. 167 cm, p = 0.018), weight (48.5 kg vs. 60 kg, p &lt; .001), as well as in the results of BMI (18.9 vs 21.5, p &lt; .001), 3SLHT test for the left leg (2.6 vs 2.8, p = 0.044) and the right leg (2.5 vs 2.95, p = 0.001), FMS (20 vs 18, p = 0.026), flexion power / kg (0.8 vs 0.9, p = 0.039) and for the maximum time without contact test on the DELOS platform for the left leg (12.6 vs 16.6, p = 0.022). Conclusions There is a difference in the selected biomechanical and functional outcomes between the group of injured and uninjured players. The footballers who scored higher values in jump tests and FMS reported injuries that had occurred more often during the football season. Additionally, the injured players were older, higher, weightier, and had higher BMI when compared to the non-injured players.",1
The Characteristic of Dynamic Balance Ability and Hip Flexibility in Soccer Players with a History of the Groin Pain: A Preliminary Study,2022-03-01,2022,SciRes Literature LLC,Journal of Biomedical Research &amp; Environmental Sciences,"Akihiro Tamura, Keita Shimura, Yuri Inoue","The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristic of hip flexibility and dynamic balance ability in the soccer players with the groin pain. The study consisted 17 male college soccer players. All participants were divided into the Groin Pain (GP) group and non-GP group, according to a history of the groin pain. Hip passive Range of Motion (ROM) test and the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) was conducted in all participants. The Mann–Whitney U test or Student’s t-test was selected to identify differences in hip ROMs and results of the mSEBT in kicking keg and supporting leg between groups. Hip abduction angle of kicking leg in the GS group were smaller than that in the non-GS group in the kicking leg (p &lt; 0.05). There were no differences in other hip ROMs between groups (p &gt; 0.05). There was no difference in results of the mSEBT between groups in both legs (p &gt; 0.05). Our results were newly revealed that soccer players with the groin pain had poor hip abduction range of motion in comparison with those without the groin pain. This finding suggested that a poor hip abductor range of motion may affect the kicking biomechanics in soccer players with the groin pain.",1

Analyzing the Relationship Between Game Factors and Psychological Pressure During a Penalty Kick,2022-02-28,2022,rScroll,Journal of Student Research,"Danny Cho, Lisa McCone","A Penalty Kick is the most advantageous dead ball situation in soccer. It is a direct spot kick twelve yards away from the goal with only the goalkeeper to beat. Instead of an issue with soccer technique or skill that causes professional players to miss penalty kicks, it is hypothesized that the psychological pressure infiltrating the penalty kick taker creates self-doubt, freezing up, and uncharacteristic errors, preventing them from striking the ball into the goal using their highest potential. Forty-six total penalty kick cases that occurred either during the 2018 Men’s FIFA World Cup or 2020 Men’s European Championships were analyzed along with a questionnaire sent out to players on the 2021/2022 Pine Creek High School Men’s Varsity Soccer Team to determine the specific game factors that influence the most psychological pressure. The conclusion of this study is that the time of when the penalty kick occurs during the match has the greatest impact on the psychological pressure a player experiences and has the most influence on the outcome of the penalty kick. The pressure a player experiences increases as the game goes on, with the most pressure and lowest level of penalty kick performance happening at the end of a game.",1

Sports Medicine and Movement Sciences,2022-02-23,2022,Elsevier BV,Heliyon,Giuseppe Musumeci,"Sports Medicine is a relatively new topic in medicine and includes a variety of medical and paramedical fields. Although sports medicine is mistakenly thought to be mainly for sports professionals/athletes, it actually encompasses the entire population, including the active and non-active healthy populations, as well as the sick [[1]Constantini N. Mann G. Sport medicine.Harefuah. 2016 Jun; 155 (388. Hebrew. PMID: 27544982): 333-334PubMed Google Scholar]. Sports medicine also engages amateur sportsmen and strives to promote physical activity and quality of life in the general population. Hence, the field involves all ages from childhood to old age, aiming to preserve and support every person at every age. Sports medicine, which started developing in the 19th century, is today a medical speciality. Currently, there exist different technologies applied in the world of sports medicine dedicated to the detection of health problems. Evidence has demonstrated that virtual environments can be useful therapeutic tools with demonstrated positive outcomes. Modern technological advances have led to the implementation of digital devices, such as wearables and smartphones, which have been shown to provide opportunities for healthcare professionals and researchers to monitor physical activity and therefore engage patients in daily exercising. Additionally, the use of digital devices has emerged as a promising tool for improving frequent health data collection, disease monitoring, and supporting public health surveillance. The leveraging of digital data has laid the foundation for the development of a new concept of epidemiological study, known as ""Digital Epidemiology"", which could contribute in the future to personalized and precision sports medicine. The understanding of the importance of physical activity and fitness as part of a healthy lifestyle is increasing all over the world, as well as the number of amateur athletes and the profession of sports medicine takes a big part in this process. Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [[2]Green A. Engstrom C. Friis P. Exercise: an essential evidence-based medicine.Med. J. Aust. 2018 Apr 2; 208: 242-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. Regular physical activity is highly beneficial for the primary, secondary and tertiary management of many common chronic conditions. There is considerable evidence for the benefits of physical activity for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, musculoskeletal conditions, some cancers, mental health and dementia [[3]Ravalli S. Castrogiovanni P. Musumeci G. Exercise as medicine to be prescribed in osteoarthritis.World J. Orthoped. 2019 Jul 18; 10 (PMID: 31363456; PMCID: PMC6650634): 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. Yet there remains a large evidence-practice gap between physicians' knowledge of the contribution of physical inactivity to chronic disease and routine effective assessment and prescription of physical activity. The benefits of physical activity for the prevention and treatment of many chronic diseases are well established, including the infection of Sars-CoV-2. Considering the countless positive effects of exercise, planning an adapted physical activity in all phases of recovery (bed rest, rehabilitation, and post-hospitalization) of the patient represents an important strategy to mitigate the decline of cognitive functions and improve the physical and psychological wellbeing of subjects affected by COVID-19. Physical activity, if adapted to the needs of the individual, practiced consistently and regularly, shows a positive influence on the immune system due to its natural protective and anti-inflammatory action. Correct and constant physical exercise, even at home, at all ages and especially in the elderly, is an extra shield against Sars-CoV-2 [[4]Maugeri G. Musumeci G. Adapted physical activity to ensure the physical and psychological well-being of COVID-19 patients.J. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2021 Jan 29; 6: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar]. Thanks to the Adapted Physical Activity patients improve the skills: psychological, mental, cardiorespiratory and muscular. For some chronic conditions, structured exercise interventions are at least as effective as drug therapy. The adapted physical activity should be prescribed in the same way as pharmacological treatment, deciding on the ""dosage"" and ""formulation"" for each patient. The ""dosage"" is calculated to reach a specific level of efficacy that prevents or improves symptoms but does not result in toxic effects [[3]Ravalli S. Castrogiovanni P. Musumeci G. Exercise as medicine to be prescribed in osteoarthritis.World J. Orthoped. 2019 Jul 18; 10 (PMID: 31363456; PMCID: PMC6650634): 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. The exercise regime should always be ""adapted"" personalized and ""tailored"" since the level of exercise will depend on the tolerability of the individual, since the body of each of us always responds differently. No do-it-yourself or generalized training/protocols should be allowed, because physical activity if done poorly, can cause more damage than a sedentary lifestyle. As stated by the American College of Sports Medicine, physical activity should be prescribed/administered, alternatively or in association with drug treatment by the Sports and/or Family Physician and/or the Kinesiologist [[5]Musumeci G. Physical activity for health—an overview and an update of the physical activity guidelines of the Italian ministry of health.J. Funct. Morphol.

Bilateral accessory head of the adductor longus muscle: an anatomical case study,2022-02-21,2022,VM Media Group sp. z o.o,Folia Morphologica,"T. Kozioł, M. P. Zarzecki, W. Przybycień, W. Twardokęs, J. A. Walocha","The adductor longus muscle, with its proximal origin at the pubic bone and distal at the linea aspera, is reported to be one of the most frequently injured groin muscles in contact sports, namely football or ice hockey. Notwithstanding, there is a scarcity of published works regarding the accessory heads of the adductor longus muscle in the existing literature, let alone the clinical significance of the said variant. The following study is a case report describing bilateral accessory heads of the adductor longus muscle in a 97-year-old female cadaver. A routine cadaveric dissection revealed two accessory heads on the right thigh and one on the left thigh of a donor with no known structural or pathological abnormalities of the proximal lower extremity. The anterior division of the obturator nerve provided nerve supply to the variants on both sides. The deep femoral, superficial external pudendal, femoral vessels were responsible for the vascular supply to the accessory heads of the adductor longus. Undoubtedly, extensive knowledge regarding the variant anatomy of the hip adductor muscles is of immense importance to physiotherapists and orthopaedists treating patients for their injury or complete tears. Nonetheless, there is little information regarding the accessory heads of the adductor longus in the existing literature (originating mostly from cadaveric studies) that requires further evaluation in vivo to assess whether this variant might have an impact on a patient's everyday life.",1
Finite Element Analysis of Soccer Ball-Related Ocular and Retinal Trauma and Comparison with Abusive Head Trauma,2022-02-20,2022,Elsevier BV,Ophthalmology Science,"Matthew R. Lam, Pengfei Dong, Yasin Shokrollahi, Linxia Gu, Donny W. Suh","Trauma to the eye resulting from a soccer ball is a common sports-related injury. Although the types of ocular pathologic features that result from impact have been documented, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanics are not as well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical events after the collision of a soccer ball with the eye to better understand the pathophysiology of observed ocular and retinal injuries and to compare them with those observed in abusive head trauma (AHT).Computer simulation study.None.A finite element model of the eye was used to investigate the effects of a collision of a soccer ball on the eye.Intraocular pressure and stress.Impact of the soccer ball with the eye generated a pressure wave that traveled through the vitreous, creating transient pockets of high and negative pressure. During the high-frequency phase, pressure in the vitreous near the posterior pole ranged from 39.6 to -30.9 kPa. Stress in ocular tissue was greatest near the point of contact, with a peak of 66.6 kPa. The retina experienced the greatest stress at the vasculature, especially at distal branches, where stress rose to 15.4 kPa. On average, retinal stress was greatest in the subretinal layer, but was highest in the preretinal layer when considering only vascular tissue.The high intraocular pressure and stress in ocular tissue near the point of soccer ball impact suggest that injuries to the anterior segment of the eye can be attributed to direct transmission of force from the ball. The subsequent propagation of a pressure wave may cause injuries to the posterior segment as the positive and negative pressures exert compressive and tractional forces on the retina. The linear movement of the pressure wave likely accounts for localization of retinal lesions to the posterior pole or superior temporal quadrant. The primarily linear force in soccer ball trauma is the probable cause for the more localized injury profile and lower retinal hemorrhage incidence compared with AHT, in which repetitive angular force is also at play.",1

Kaminski","Background: Early sport specialization has been associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal injuries and unfavorable psychological outcomes; however, it is unknown whether sport specialization is associated with worse cognitive, postural, and psychological functions in first-year collegiate student-athletes. Methods: First-year collegiate multisport (MA) and single-sport (SA) student-athletes were identified using a pre-collegiate sport experience questionnaire. The cognitive, postural, and psychological functions were assessed by the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18). Results: MA student-athletes performed higher in cognitive outcomes (e.g., higher ImPACT visual memory composite scores [ß = 0.056, p &lt; 0.001]), but had higher psychological distress (e.g., higher BSI-18 global severity index [ß = 0.057, p &lt; 0.001]) and no difference in postural stability (p &gt; 0.05) than SA student-athletes. Conclusions: This study indicated first-year collegiate athletes with a history of sport specialization demonstrate lower cognitive performance but decreased psychological distress and no differences in static postural stability as compared to their MA counterparts. Future studies should consider involving different health measures to better understand the influence of sport specialization on overall physical and mental health.",1

Kinematic data of hip, knee, and ankle joints in the sagittal plane were recorded by a GoPro camera at the moments of heel-ground contact and toe-off the ground before and after a 6-week intervention (two sessions per week).The results indicate a 35% post-intervention increase of ankle dorsiflexion (95% CI: - 5.63 _ - 0.96) in the moment of heel-ground contact in the model-oriented group; however, knee flexion (95% CI: - 1.05 _ 8.34) and hip flexion (95% CI: 3.01 _ 11.78) were respectively decreased by 20% and 20%. After the intervention, moreover, ankle plantar flexion (95% CI: - 9.18 _ - 2.81) and hip extension (95% CI: - 12.87 _ - 3.72) have respectively increased by 37% and 37%, while knee flexion (95% CI: 3.49 _ 11.30) showed a %16 decrease in the moment of toe off the ground. As for the Differential Learning group, ankle dorsiflexion (95% CI: - 5.19 _ - 1.52) increased by 33%, and knee (95% CI: 0.60 _ 5.76) and hip flexion (95% CI: 2.15 _ 7.85) respectively decreased by 17% and 17% at the moment of the heel-ground contact following the intervention. At toe lifting off the ground, the plantar flexion (95% CI: - 7.77 _ - 2.77) increased by 35%, knee flexion (95% CI: 2.17 _ 7.27) decreased to 14%, and hip extension (95% CI: - 9.98 _ - 4.20) increased by %35 following the intervention for the Differential Learning group subjects. Based on the results obtained from the one-way ANOVA, there was a significant difference between these groups and the control group in all kinematic gait variables (p ≤ 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were found between the two experimental groups.The results implied that the model-oriented repetitive and the self-organized Differential Learning approach were both appropriate to alter the kinematic gait pattern in the 3-5-year-old children. Previous research has almost exclusively recommended a model-oriented approach to change kinematic patterns and preventing non-contact motor injuries. However, the present study showed that the Differential Learning approach can help children to achieve the same goal by continuously changing environments and stimulating challenges.Current Controlled Trials using the IRCT website with ID number of, IRCT20130109012078N5 ""Prospectively registered"" at 14/5/2021.",1
A Comparative Study on Angular Compartment of Hip Flexion Before and After Training: A Case of 11 to 12-Year-old Soccer Players,2022-02-12,2022,Book Publisher International (a part of SCIENCEDOMAIN International),Issues and Developments in Medicine and Medical Research Vol. 8,"G. Jair Burboa, M. Mauricio Inostroza, F. Matías Bahamondes, U. Paloma Lillo, C. Jaime Hinzpeter","An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is an important cause of rest in athletes. This injury usually occur while practicing sports and it is more common during competition than during training. In most cases, ACL injuries do not require external contact and they are associated with biomechanical risk factors that increase ACL tension. The increase of the hip flexion angle (HF) is included within these. The ACL requires cooperation of the periarticular musculature of the knee, muscle groups, hip stabilizers and CORE muscles; consequently, fatigue caused by exercise would alter the balance and put this ligament at risk. The objective of the study is to determine the angular behavior for HF before and after a physical load (a standardized training) in children between 11 and 12 years old. A non-randomized clinical study was carried out. The sample consisted of 50 soccer school students born between 11 and 12 years old. The angular behavior of HF was compared before and after performing a training session. The angular behavior was measured through the Drop Jump test (DJ), with data obtained by inertial sensors. After the exercise, there was a significant increase in HF. It was concluded that the angular behavior of HF increases significantly in both extremities after training and that preventive measures must be applied for neuromuscular control of the hip.",1
Prevention Programs: Hip Angle Behaviour in Landing after Drop Jump in Children,2022-02-12,2022,Book Publisher International (a part of SCIENCEDOMAIN International),Issues and Developments in Medicine and Medical Research Vol. 7,"G. Jair Burboa, F. Matias Bahamondes, M. Mauricio Inostroza, U. Paloma Lillo, Jaime Hinzpeter","Background: The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is uncommon, but constitutes an important percentage of the lesions requiring more than 8 weeks of recovery in sports. Most ACL injuries do not require external contact and are associated with biomechanical risk factors that stress this ligament ACL: like an increase in knee valgus an- gle (KV) and hip flexion (HF) and a decreased in knee flexion (KF). The ACL requires muscle cooperation to resist the load; however, when there is fatigue, the protective capacity of the musculature would decrease. Objectives: The objective of the study is to analyze the angular behavior before and after a physical load for HF in children of 14-15 years old Hypothesis: The physical load applied in a single training session is enough to change some biomechanical risk factors of ACL injury. Study Design: Experimental study. Level of Evidence: 2b. Methods: The sample consisted of 50 students from different soccer schools between 14-15 years old. We analyzed the hip angular behavior of hip flexion before and after a training session. The angles where obtained from inertioal sensor while the students performed a Drop Jump test from a 30 centimeters drawer. Results: Statistically significant differences were found in the differences between pre physical load HF / post-load HF (p = 0.00053), right pre physical load HF / right post- load HF (p = 0.0086) and left post- load (p = 0.0248206). Conclusions: It was concluded that the angular behavior of HF increases significantly in both post-training limbs, after performing a physical load. Clinical Relevance: This study analyzed the importance of using prevention injury programs since early stages, and give importance to the eccentric role of hamstring, gluteus and core exercises.",1
"The Effects of Proprioceptive Training on Balance, Strength, Agility and Dribbling in Adolescent Male Soccer Players",2022-02-11,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Diana Victoria Gidu, Dana Badau, Marius Stoica, Adrian Aron, George Focan, Dan Monea, Alina Mihaela Stoica, Nicoleta Daniela Calota","The aim of the study was to determine the effects of proprioceptive training (PT) on balance, strength, agility and dribbling in adolescent soccer players. In this research, we included an experimental (n = 48) and a control (n = 48) group (CG) with 14 years old players. The experimental group (EG) participated in an 8 week PT program, with four 30 min sessions per week. The experimental program included 12 bosu ball exercises to improve balance, stability and strength which were grouped into two subprograms: the first not using the soccer ball, the second subprogram using the soccer ball. The subprograms were implemented alternately during 16 proprioceptive training sessions, on two types of firm and foam surfaces. Pre- and post-tests included the static balance [Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)], vertical, horizontal, and lateral jumping, and the completion of agility (""arrowhead"") and dribbling (""short dribbling"") tests. Regarding the total BESS score, the CG has demonstrated progress between the pre- and the post-test, with 0.780 ± 0.895, fewer errors, while the EG had 5.828 ± 1.017 fewer errors. The difference between the two groups was of 5.148 fewer errors for the EG who had practiced the proposed program of proprioceptive training. The highest difference registered between the pre- and the post-test was at the test ""single-leg forward jump with the right leg"", with a result of 1.083 ± 0.459 cm for the CG and of 3.916 ± 0. 761 cm for the EG. Through the analysis of average differences between the pre- and the post-tests, we observe that, regarding the ""Agility right side test"", the EG has progressed with 0.382 s in comparison with the CG; regarding the ""Agility left side test"", the EG has progressed with 0.233 s compared to the CG; regarding the ""Agility right and left side test"", the EG has progressed with 0.196 s compared to the CG; in the ""Short dribbling test"", the EG has progressed with 0.174 s compared to the CG. The highest progress was made at the ""Agility right side test"", of 0.402 s for the EG, while the CG registered 0.120 s. Most of the results in all tests for both experimental groups show an effect size ranging from small to medium. The progress made by the experimental group in all tests was statistically significant, while in the control group the progress was mostly statistically insignificant for p < 0.05. The results suggest that a PT program performed at about 14 years of age could be successfully implemented in the training regime of soccer players to improve components of fitness along with dribbling skills. The results of the study revealed that sports training on the foam surfaces determined a superior progress of the development of proprioception compared to the increased training on the firm surfaces.",1
An End-to-End Deep Learning Pipeline for Football Activity Recognition Based on Wearable Acceleration Sensors,2022-02-10,2022,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Rafael Cuperman, Kaspar M. B. Jansen, Michał G. Ciszewski","Action statistics in sports, such as the number of sprints and jumps, along with the details of the corresponding locomotor actions, are of high interest to coaches and players, as well as medical staff. Current video-based systems have the disadvantage that they are costly and not easily transportable to new locations. In this study, we investigated the possibility to extract these statistics from acceleration sensor data generated by a previously developed sensor garment. We used deep learning-based models to recognize five football-related activities (jogging, sprinting, passing, shooting and jumping) in an accurate, robust, and fast manner. A combination of convolutional (CNN) layers followed by recurrent (bidirectional) LSTM layers achieved up to 98.3% of accuracy. Our results showed that deep learning models performed better in evaluation time and prediction accuracy than traditional machine learning algorithms. In addition to an increase in accuracy, the proposed deep learning architecture showed to be 2.7 to 3.4 times faster in evaluation time than traditional machine learning methods. This demonstrated that deep learning models are accurate as well as time-efficient and are thus highly suitable for cost-effective, fast, and accurate human activity recognition tasks.",1
Determining jumping performance from a single body-worn accelerometer using machine learning,2022-02-10,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Mark G. E. White, Neil E. Bezodis, Jonathon Neville, Huw Summers, Paul Rees","External peak power in the countermovement jump is frequently used to monitor athlete training. The gold standard method uses force platforms, but they are unsuitable for field-based testing. However, alternatives based on jump flight time or Newtonian methods applied to inertial sensor data have not been sufficiently accurate for athlete monitoring. Instead, we developed a machine learning model based on characteristic features (functional principal components) extracted from a single body-worn accelerometer. Data were collected from 69 male and female athletes at recreational, club or national levels, who performed 696 jumps in total. We considered vertical countermovement jumps (with and without arm swing), sensor anatomical locations, machine learning models and whether to use resultant or triaxial signals. Using a novel surrogate model optimisation procedure, we obtained the lowest errors with a support vector machine when using the resultant signal from a lower back sensor in jumps without arm swing. This model had a peak power RMSE of 2.3 W·kg-1 (5.1% of the mean), estimated using nested cross validation and supported by an independent holdout test (2.0 W·kg-1). This error is lower than in previous studies, although it is not yet sufficiently accurate for a field-based method. Our results demonstrate that functional data representations work well in machine learning by reducing model complexity in applications where signals are aligned in time. Our optimisation procedure also was shown to be robust can be used in wider applications with low-cost, noisy objective functions.",1
Incidence of calcaneal apophysitis (Sever’s disease) and return-to-play in adolescent athletes of a German youth soccer academy: a retrospective study of 10 years,2022-02-09,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Patrick Belikan, Lars-Christopher Färber, Frédéric Abel, Tobias E. Nowak, Philipp Drees, Stefan G. Mattyasovszky","Calcaneal apophysitis, or Sever's disease, is the most common cause of heel pain in childhood and adolescence. It is regarded as an overuse syndrome. Studies on the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in young athletes and their associated return-to-play time are lacking in the current literature. The aim of our current study was to identify the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in professional youth soccer, the associated time to return-to-play, predisposing factors and their impact on time to return-to-play.Retrospective evaluation of injury data gathered from a German youth soccer academy in the years 2009-2018. In total, 4326 injury cases in 612 players were included in the study. The diagnosis and the follow-up visits were carried out in a weekly consultation hour at the youth academy.During the observation period of 10 years, 22 cases of calcaneal apophysitis were detected. The incidence of calcaneal apophysitis per 100 athletes per year was found to be 0.36. The mean age of the affected athletes at the time of diagnosis was 11.8 ± 2.1 years (MW ± SD). The complaints were unilateral in 20 and bilateral in two cases. Three of the 22 detected cases of calcaneal apophysitis (13.6%) were recurrent injuries. The mean time to return-to-play of the affected athletes was 60.7 ± 64.9 days (MW ± SD). Athletes with recurrent complaints showed longer recovery time and time to return-to-play when compared to players with primary diagnosed disease. Our results could show that neither age nor body mass index at the time of diagnosis had an impact on time to return-to-play.This is the first study investigating the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis and the associated time to return-to-play in youth elite soccer. Calcaneal apophysitis results in substantial time loss for the athletes. Further prospective clinical studies are required to fully understand the etiology and risk factors for calcaneal apophysitis and therefore develop preventive strategies.",1
Acute effects from the half-squat performed using a repetition versus differential approach in youth soccer players,2022-02-09,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Diogo Coutinho, Eduardo Abade, Bruno Gonçalves, Sara Santos, Wolfgang Schöllhorn, Jaime Sampaio","Over the last years there have been a wide body of research exploring the best strategies to promote acute enhancements in players' performance. Despite that, most studies have been focused on adult and elite players, and different results may be identified when considering players from lower levels of performance and belonging to youth categories. In addition, most studies conducted in this domain focused in repetitive movement patterns, and while adding variability has been considered as a useful approach to enhance players' performance at short and long-term perspectives, less is known regarding it applicability to acute enhance players physical performance. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the acute enhancement effects of performing the half-squat in a flywheel ergometer between a more-repetitive approach (low noise) and a more variable approach (differential learning, high noise) in youth soccer players.A total of sixteen players (age = 16.2 ± 0.6 years) was exposed to four conditions in a randomized order: (1) repetitive intervention for 30 s; (2) repetitive intervention for 10-min; (3) differential learning intervention for 30 s; (4) differential learning intervention for 10-min. Each condition consisted in 3 sets of 6 repetitions of eccentric half squats performed in a flywheel ergometer. Countermovement jump, 10 m and 30 m linear sprint, and change-of-direction ability were measured every session at baseline (pre-test) and after each protocol (post-test).No potentiation effect was observed overall with any of the interventions. In addition, no differences between protocols were found for sprinting. However, the repetitive intervention impaired jumping performance for both 30 s (small effects, p ≤ .05) and 10-min intervals (small effects, p ≤ .05), as well as in the change-of-direction task for 30 s (p ≤ .05).These results may be due to the players' low experience in eccentric flywheel training. Despite these findings, individual potentiation responses emerged from both protocols when considering the individual responses, reinforcing the need to establish more personalized approaches.",1
"The collection, analysis and exploitation of footballer attributes: A systematic review",2022-02-08,2022,SAGE Publications,Journal of Sports Analytics,"Edward Wakelam, Volker Steuber, James Wakelam","There is growing on-going research into how footballer attributes, collected prior to, during and post-match, may address the demands of clubs, media pundits and gaming developers. Focusing upon individual player performance analysis and prediction, we examined the body of research which considers different player attributes. This resulted in the selection of 132 relevant papers published between 1999 and 2020. From these we have compiled a comprehensive list of player attributes, categorising them as static, such as age and height, or dynamic, such as pass completions and shots on target. To indicate their accuracy, we classified each attribute as objectively or subjectively derived, and finally by their implied accessibility and their likely personal and club sensitivity. We assigned these attributes to 25 logical groups such as passing, tackling and player demographics. We analysed the relative research focus on each group and noted the analytical methods deployed, identifying which statistical or machine learning techniques were used. We reviewed and considered the use of character trait attributes in the selected papers and discuss more formal approaches to their use. Based upon this we have made recommendations on how this work may be developed to support elite clubs in the consideration of transfer targets.",1
Biomechanical Process of Skeletal Muscle under Training Condition Based on 3D Visualization Technology,2022-02-08,2022,Wiley,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,Chen Chen,"With the development and popularization of 3D technology, human behavior recognition has gradually developed from plane feature recognition to elevation feature recognition. In the process of collecting motion characteristics, the research on skeletal muscle will lead to a series of data in time series, which is the basis of sports biomechanics research and sports training. Some important semantic information such as centerline and joint center can be obtained by further data processing. The results of the study showed that the three-dimensional coordinate positions of the femur and pelvic attachment points of the muscles surrounding the hip joint from the pelvis were measured and positioned. A 3D model is built to simulate the human skeletal model subjected to speeds of 3 and 7 m/s, and different motion velocities can exhibit different motions. The research in this study shows that using 3D technology and comprehensively utilizing the expertise of biomechanical analysis and graphical modeling to study the mechanical properties of bone joints and soft tissues provide new ways and methods.",1

Do Relaxin Levels Impact Hip Injury Incidence in Women? A Scoping Review,2022-02-04,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Endocrinology,"Emily A. Parker, Alex M. Meyer, Jessica E. Goetz, Michael C. Willey, Robert W. Westermann","The aim of this review is to assess the current evidence regarding the impact of relaxin on incidence of soft tissue hip injuries in women.A trained research librarian assisted with searches of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus, with a preset English language filter. The review was completed per the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis methodology. Included studies required assessment of relaxin effects on musculoskeletal health, pelvic girdle stability, or hip joint structures in human subjects. Letters, texts, and opinion papers were excluded.Our screen yielded 82 studies. Molecularly, relaxin activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including collagenases MMP-1/-13 and gelatinases MMP-2/-9 to loosen pelvic ligaments for parturition. However, relaxin receptors have also been detected in female periarticular tissues, such as the anterior cruciate ligament, which tears significantly more often during the menstrual cycle peak of relaxin. Recently, high concentrations of relaxin-activated MMP-9 receptors have been found on the acetabular labrum; their expression upregulated by estrogen.Menstrual cycle peaks of relaxin activate MMPs, which locally degrade collagen and gelatine. Women have relaxin receptors in multiple joints including the hip and knee, and increased relaxin correlates with increased musculoskeletal injuries. Relaxin has paracrine effects in the female pelvis on ligaments adjacent to hip structures, such as acetabular labral cells which express high levels of relaxin-targeted MMPs. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the effect of relaxin on the hip to determine if increased levels of relaxin are associated with an increased risk of acetabular labral tears.",1
Influence of Compliance and Aging of Artificial Turf Surfaces on Lower Extremity Joint Loading,2022-02-04,2022,MDPI AG,Biomechanics,"Nicole Schrier, John William Wannop, Jay T. Worobets, Darren J. Stefanyshyn","Background: Artificial turf (AT) has been related to increased injury rates when compared to natural grass (NG). One potential reason for the differences in injury rates is the difference in mechanical characteristics of the surfaces. Over the course of a season on artificial turf, due to heavy use and environmental factors, properties of the surface (such as compliance) may be altered. The purpose was to compare the effects of newly installed versus aged AT on injury risks at the metatarsophalangeal, ankle, and knee joint during soccer-specific movements. Methods: Eleven male soccer players performed three movements on newly installed and ‘aged’ AT. Kinematics and kinetics were collected for the different surfaces. Results: Knee adduction moments were increased during the v-cut (119 Nm vs. 164 Nm, p = 0.02), and knee external rotation joint moments were increased during the circle run (23 Nm vs. 28 Nm, p = 0.04) with the aged surface. No surface effects were seen during the jog-sprint transition. Conclusions: For movements associated with a high risk for non-contact injuries, the age of the AT resulted in greater risk factors for injury potential at the knee joint. Further research comparing injury rates associated with AT should consider mechanical features, specifically surface compliance.",1
Quantifying volume and high-speed technical actions of professional soccer players using foot-mounted inertial measurement units,2022-02-03,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Glyn Lewis, Christopher Towlson, Pietro Roversi, Chris Domogalla, Lee Herrington, Steve Barrett","The aims of the study were two-fold: i) examine the validity and reliability of high-speed kicking actions using foot-mounted inertial measurement unit's (IMU), ii) quantify soccer players within-microcycle and inter-positional differences in both the frequency and speed of technical actions.During the in-season phase (25 weeks) of the UK domestic season, 21 professional soccer player ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index were analysed. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and confidence intervals were used to determine the validity between the systems, whilst a general linear mixed model analysis approach was used to establish estimated marginal mean values for total ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index.Good concurrent validity was observed for ball release velocity and high-speed kicks against a high-speed camera (r2- 0.96, CI 0.93-0.98). Ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index all showed main effects for fixture proximity (p>0.001), playing positions (p>0.001) and across different training categories (p>0.001). The greatest high-speed ball releases were observed on a match-day (MD)+1 (17.6 ± 11.9; CI- 16.2 to 19) and MD-2 (16.8 ± 15; CI- 14.9 to 18.7), with MD+1 exhibiting the highest number of ball releases (161.1 ± 51.2; CI- 155.0 to 167.2) and ball release index (145.5 ± 45.2; CI- 140.1 to 150.9) across all fixture proximities. Possessions (0.3 ± 0.9; CI- 0.3 to 0.4) and small-sided games (1.4 ± 1.6; CI- 1.4 to 1.5), had the lowest values for high-speed ball releases with technical (6.1 ± 7.2; CI- 5.7 to 6.6) and tactical (10.0 ± 10.5; CI- 6.9 to 13.1) drills showing the largest high-speed ball releases.The present study provides novel information regarding the quantification of technical actions of professional soccer players. Insights into absolute and relative frequency and intensity of releases in different drill types, provide practitioners with valuable information on technical outputs that can be manipulated during the process of planning training programmes to produce desired outcomes. Both volume and speed of ball release actions should be measured, when monitoring the technical actions in training according to fixture proximity, drill type and player position to permit enhanced training prescription.",1
Meniscal Preservation is More Likely When Performed with Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Repair Rather Than with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2022-02-02,2022,Surgical Technology Online,Surgical Technology Online,"William Wilson, Graeme Hopper, Chris Hamilton, Lucas O’Donnell, Mark Blyth, Gordon Mackay","Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) often occurs in conjunction with meniscal tears. In this study, we investigate the rates and outcomes of meniscal repair surgery performed with ACL reconstruction compared with acute ACL repair surgery.Data was collected for all patients undergoing surgery for ACL ruptures between 2012 and 2018, including ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft and primary ACL repair augmented with suture tape. Patients undergoing multi-ligament surgery were excluded. Meniscal injury was evaluated intraoperatively and the treatment was determined by type of tear, reducibility, and quality of meniscal tissue. If possible, tears were repaired using all-inside anchors and all others were resected.There were 272 ACL reconstructions and 134 ACL repairs, and mean age was 28 (±9) and 35 (±14) years, respectively (p <0.01). The mean Tegner activity score was 6.6 in both groups. The mean interval from injury to surgery was longer in the reconstruction group (26.2 vs. 1.3 months, p <0.01). Fifty-five percent of reconstructions and 43% of ACL repairs required meniscal surgery at the time of their ACL procedure. In the reconstruction group, 123 (70%) were meniscectomies and 53 (30%) were meniscal repairs, compared to 31 (50%) of each in the ACL repair group. Meniscal repair was more likely to be possible when carried out as part of acute ACL repair surgery, c2(1, n=238)=7.94, p <0.01. The success rate of meniscal repair was 97% in both groups.The rate of meniscal repair is 67% higher when performed early with ACL repair. When ACL reconstruction is performed, meniscal resection was more likely. Rates of post-traumatic osteoarthritis are high after ACL reconstruction when performed with meniscal resection. Furthermore, the success rate of meniscal repair in conjunction with ACL surgery is high (97%). Therefore, meniscal repair should be encouraged whenever possible to improve long-term outcomes.",1
A Brief Review of Selected Biomechanical Variables for Sport Performance Monitoring and Training Optimization,2022-02-01,2022,MDPI AG,Applied Mechanics,"Jernej Pleša, Žiga Kozinc, Nejc Šarabon","Traditional neuromuscular tests (e.g., jumping and sprinting tasks) are useful to assess athletic performance, but the basic outcomes (e.g., jump height, sprint time) offer only a limited amount of information, warranting a more detailed approach to performance testing. With a more analytical approach and biomechanical testing, neuromuscular function can be assessed in-depth. In this article, we review the utility of selected biomechanical variables (eccentric utilization ratio, force–velocity relationship, reactive strength index, and bilateral deficit) for monitoring sport performance and training optimization. These variables still represent a macroscopic level of analysis, but provide a more detailed insight into an individual’s neuromuscular capabilities, which can be overlooked in conventional testing. Although the aforementioned “alternative” variables are more complex in biomechanical terms, they are relatively simple to examine, with no need for additional technology other than what is already necessary for performing the conventional tests (for example, even smartphones can be used in many cases). In this review, we conclude that, with the exception of the eccentric utilization ratio, all of the selected variables have some potential for evaluating sport performance.",1

Conclusions:The modified LESS may be an appropriate clinical screening tool for assessing sport-related non-contact lower extremity injury risk in athletes.The proposed template and thresholds require further scientific validation.",1
Periods of Competitive Break in Soccer: Implications on Individual and Collective Performance,2022-01-31,2022,Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.,The Open Sports Sciences Journal,"André P. Marques, Bruno Travassos, Luís Branquinho, Ricardo Ferraz","Competitive breaks in soccer have been revealed to be detrimental to the individual and collective performance of soccer players and teams. Several studies have been carried out, and the evidence suggests the need to apply specific training programs to avoid a decline in soccer players’ performance. However, the elaboration of these specific programs, in many cases, is essentially focused on physical performance, neglecting the technical and behavioral domain. In this small review, the competitive breaks and their main effects for detraining were critically analyzed. Concurrently, we analyzed the effects of the use of specific training programs to avoid changes in the performance of soccer players and teams. It is essential to create guidelines for coaches to apply for specific training programs properly during competitive breaks so that soccer players can maintain their individual and collective performance, considering the physiological, technical, and behavioral domains. Applying of these programs will also contribute to enhancing soccer players’ physical condition, increasing their tolerance to the imposed training loads, and, consequently, reducing the appearance of injuries.",1
Sprint Performance and Mechanical Force-Velocity Profile among Different Maturational Stages in Young Soccer Players,2022-01-27,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Luis Miguel Fernández-Galván, Pedro Jiménez-Reyes, Víctor Cuadrado-Peñafiel, Arturo Casado","The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of maturation status on the components of the sprint force-velocity (F-V) profile in young soccer players. Sixty-two young male soccer players from the same professional soccer academy took part in the present study. A cross-sectional design was implemented to compare the main components of the sprint F-V profile (i.e., maximal theoretical force (F0), velocity (V0), power (Pmax), and ratio of horizontal-to-resultant force (RFpeak), and decrease in the ratio of horizontal-to-resultant force (DRF)) and sprint performance (5, 20, and 30 m sprint time) among participants' maturation stages (i.e., pre-, mid- and post-peak height velocity (PHV) groups). The results show that the ES of differences in 5 min sprint performance, F0, and RFpeak (i.e., strength- and acceleration-related components of the sprint F-V profile) were greater between pre- and mid-PHV groups than those between mid- and post-PHV groups (i.e., large and very large effects (1.24 ≤ ES ≤ 2.42) vs. moderate, small, and zero effects (0 ≤ ES ≤ 0.69), respectively). However, the ES of differences in V0 and DRF (i.e., peak speed-related components of the sprint F-V profile) were greater between mid- and post-PHV groups than those between pre- and mid-PHV groups (i.e., large effects (1.54 ≤ ES ≤ 1.92) vs. moderate effects (-0.59 ≤ ES ≤ 1), respectively). Once the strength development is achieved to a great extent from the pre- to mid-PHV groups, specific strength training methods may be used for young soccer players to improve their sprint performance.",1
Beyond Distance: A Simple Qualitative Assessment of the Single-Leg Hop Test in Return-to-Play Testing,2022-01-26,2022,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"Stefano Di Paolo, Stefano Zaffagnini, Filippo Tosarelli, Alberto Grassi, Francesco Della Villa","Background: Limb symmetry index in the single-leg hop (SLH) test has been questioned for its low predictive value in identifying secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The purpose of this study was to describe a qualitative 2-dimensional (2D) scoring system for the assessment of the SLH test and associate it with the vertical ground-reaction forces (vGRF) and sagittal plane biomechanics evaluated through gold standard 3D motion analysis. Hypothesis: Stiff landings would be associated with low 2D scores. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: Thirty-four competitive football (soccer) players (age 22.8 ± 4.1 years, 16 women) were enrolled. Each athlete performed a series of SLH tests. Three-dimensional motion analysis was recorded using 10 stereophotogrammetric cameras, a force platform, and 3 high-speed cameras. The 2D qualitative assessment was performed through a scoring system based on the video-analysis of sagittal plane joint kinematics. A score of 0/2 (inadequate), 1/2 (partially adequate), or 2/2 (adequate) was attributed to the movement, based on objective measurements. The vGRF was extracted from the force platform and grouped according to the results of the 2D evaluation. Results: Significantly higher vGRF (stiffer landing) was found for athletes obtaining a 0/2 score compared with those obtaining a 2/2 score (up to 0.8 body weight higher, P &lt; 0.01). A significant negative rank correlation was found between the vGRF and the total score (ρ = −0.17, P = 0.03). Conclusion: The qualitative scoring system effectively identified stiff landings in the SLH for distance test. Clinical Relevance: The qualitative scoring system could be a user-friendly standardized method to assess athletes’ movement quality in return to sport clearance decision after ACL injury.",1
Association between Preseason/Regular Season Head Impact Exposure and Concussion Incidence in NCAA Football,2022-01-25,2022,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"BRIAN D.

MCCREA","Contact sport athletes are exposed to a unique environment where they sustain repeated head impacts throughout the season and can sustain hundreds of head impacts over a few months. Accordingly, recent studies outlined the role that head impact exposure (HIE) has in concussion biomechanics and in the development of cognitive and brain-based changes. Those studies focused on time-bound effects by quantifying exposure leading up to the concussion, or cognitive changes after a season in which athletes had high HIE. However, HIE may have a more prolonged effect. This study identified associations between HIE and concussion incidence during different periods of the college football fall season.This study included 1120 athlete seasons from six National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football programs across 5 yr. Athletes were instrumented with the Head Impact Telemetry System to record daily HIE. The analysis quantified associations of preseason/regular season/total season concussion incidence with HIE during those periods.Strong associations were identified between HIE and concussion incidence during different periods of the season. Preseason HIE was associated with preseason and total season concussion incidence, and total season HIE was associated with total season concussion incidence.These findings demonstrate a prolonged effect of HIE on concussion risk, wherein elevated preseason HIE was associated with higher concussion risk both during the preseason and throughout the entire fall season. This investigation is the first to provide evidence supporting the hypothesis of a relationship between elevated HIE during the college football preseason and a sustained decreased tolerance for concussion throughout that season.",1
Feasibility of Growth Factor Agent Therapy in Repairing Motor Injury,2022-01-25,2022,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Pharmacology,"Qiaoyin Tan, Jiayu Li, Yuwen Liu, Xiaojuan Zhu, Weide Shao","Growth factors (GF), with the activity of stimulating cell growth, play a significant role in biology, medicine, and exercise physiology. In the process of exercise, human tissues are impacted, making cells suffer damage. Growth factor can accelerate the repair of damaged cells and regulate the synthesis of protein, so biological preparations of growth factors can be added to traditional therapies. A combination of growth factor biologics and conventional therapies may improve the efficiency of injury repair, but growth factor biologics may not produce any results. The feasibility of growth factor biologics in the treatment of motor injury was discussed. The research have shown that: 1) GF biological agent therapy is a very promising treatment for motor injury, which is based on the power of autologous growth factor (GFs) to accelerate tissue healing, promote muscle regeneration, increase angiogenesis, reduce fibrosis, and make the muscle injury rapid recovery. 2) There are various methods for delivering the higher dose of GF to the injured tissue, but most of them depend on the platelet release of GF. At the site of injury, there are several ways to deliver higher doses of GF to the injured tissue. 3) At present, the inhibition of GF is mainly through signal transduction inhibitors and inhibition of transcription factor production. 4) Pattern of GF during wound repair: GF directly regulates many key steps of normal wound repair, including inflammatory cell chemotaxis, division and proliferation of fibroblasts, keratinocytes and vascular endothelial cells, formation of new blood vessels, and synthesis and degradation of intercellular substances. 5) When GF promotes chronic wound healing, in most cases, certain GF can be used targeted only when in vivo regulation still cannot meet the need for repair.",1
Automatic Markerless Motion Detector Method against Traditional Digitisation for 3-Dimensional Movement Kinematic Analysis of Ball Kicking in Soccer Field Context,2022-01-21,2022,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Luiz H.

Comparison of a computer vision system against three-dimensional motion capture for tracking football movements in a stadium environment,2022-01-21,2022,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"Robert J. Aughey, Kevin Ball, Sam J. Robertson, Grant M. Duthie, Fabio R. Serpiello, Nicolas Evans, Bartholomew Spencer, Susanne Ellens, Emily Cust, Jade Haycraft, Johsan Billingham","Abstract Three-dimensional motion capture systems such as Vicon have been used to validate commercial electronic performance and tracking systems. However, three-dimensional motion capture cannot be used for large capture areas such as a full football pitch due to the need for many fragile cameras to be placed around the capture volume and a lack of suitable depth of field of those cameras. There is a need, therefore, for a hybrid testing solution for commercial electronic performance and tracking systems using highly precise three-dimensional motion capture in a small test area and a computer vision system in other areas to test for full-pitch coverage by the commercial systems. This study aimed to establish the validity of VisionKit computer vision system against three-dimensional motion capture in a stadium environment. Ten participants undertook a series of football-specific movement tasks, including a circuit, small-sided games and a 20 m sprint. There was strong agreement between VisionKit and three-dimensional motion capture across each activity undertaken. The root mean square difference for speed was 0.04 m·s −1 and for position was 0.18 m. VisionKit had strong agreement with the criterion three-dimensional motion capture system three-dimensional motion capture for football-related movements tested in stadium environments. VisionKit can thus be used to establish the concurrent validity of other electronic performance and tracking systems in circumstances where three-dimensional motion capture cannot be used.",1
Cumulative strain-based metrics for predicting subconcussive head impact exposure–related imaging changes in a cohort of American youth football players,2022-01-21,2022,Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group (JNSPG),Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics,"Logan E. Miller, Jillian E. Urban, Mark A. Espeland, Michael P. Walkup, James M. Holcomb, Elizabeth M. Davenport, Alexander K. Powers, Christopher T. Whitlow, Joseph A. Maldjian, Joel D. Stitzel","Youth football athletes are exposed to repetitive subconcussive head impacts during normal participation in the sport, and there is increasing concern about the long-term effects of these impacts. The objective of the current study was to determine if strain-based cumulative exposure measures are superior to kinematic-based exposure measures for predicting imaging changes in the brain.This prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted from 2012 to 2017 and assessed youth, male football athletes. Kinematic data were collected at all practices and games from enrolled athletes participating in local youth football organizations in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and were used to calculate multiple risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWE) kinematic metrics and 36 strain-based exposure metrics. Pre- and postseason imaging was performed at Wake Forest School of Medicine, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), and its components (CL, CP, and CS), and mean diffusivity (MD), were investigated. Included participants were youth football players ranging in age from 9 to 13 years. Exclusion criteria included any history of previous neurological illness, psychiatric illness, brain tumor, concussion within the past 6 months, and/or contraindication to MRI.A total of 95 male athletes (mean age 11.9 years [SD 1.0 years]) participated between 2012 and 2017, with some participating for multiple seasons, resulting in 116 unique athlete-seasons. Regression analysis revealed statistically significant linear relationships between the FA, linear coefficient (CL), and spherical coefficient (CS) and all strain exposure measures, and well as the planar coefficient (CP) and 8 strain measures. For the kinematic exposure measures, there were statistically significant relationships between FA and RWE linear (RWEL) and RWE combined probability (RWECP) as well as CS and RWEL. According to area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis, the best-performing metrics were all strain measures, and included metrics based on tensile, compressive, and shear strain.Using ROC curves and AUC analysis, all exposure metrics were ranked in order of performance, and the results demonstrated that all the strain-based metrics performed better than any of the kinematic metrics, indicating that strain-based metrics are better discriminators of imaging changes than kinematic-based measures. Studies relating the biomechanics of head impacts with brain imaging and cognitive function may allow equipment designers, care providers, and organizations to prevent, identify, and treat injuries in order to make football a safer activity.",1
Measurement properties of external training load variables during standardised games in soccer: Implications for training and monitoring strategies,2022-01-21,2022,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Jo Clubb, Chris Towlson, Steve Barrett","The aim of this study was to assess the measurement properties of external training load measures across three formats of standardised training games. Eighty-eight players from two English professional soccer clubs participated in the study spanning three consecutive seasons. External training load data was collected from three types of standardised game format drills (11v11, 10v10, 7v7+6) using Global Positioning Systems. For each external training load metric in each game format, the following measurement properties were calculated; coefficient of variation (CV%) to determine between- and within-subject reliability, intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to determine test-retest reliability, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to determine sensitivity. Total distance (TD) and PlayerLoad ™ (PL) demonstrated good sensitivity (TD SNR = 1.6–4.6; PL SNR = 1.2–4.3) on a group level. However, a wide variety of within-subject reliability was demonstrated for these variables (TD CV% = 1.7–36.3%; PL CV% = 4.3–39.5%) and corresponding intensity measures calculated per minute. The percentage contribution of individual planes to PL showed the lowest between-subject CV% (CV% = 2–7%), although sensitivity varied across formats (SNR = 0.3–1.4). High speed running demonstrated poor reliability across all three formats of SSG (CV% = 51–103%, ICC = 0.03–0.53). Given the measurement properties of external training load measures observed in this study, specifically the within-subject variation, reliability across trials of standardised training games should be calculated on an individual level. This will allow practitioners to detect worthwhile changes across trials of standardised game format drills. Such information is important for the appropriate implementation of training and monitoring strategies in soccer.",1

Factors predicting the response to NMT in reducing injury risk are unknown, making this the objective of the present study. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> This is a secondary analysis of the intervention groups of randomized controlled trials evaluating NMT warm-ups among youth (11–18 years) [basketball (n=494), soccer (n=380), physical education (PE; n=919)]. Response was predicted based on age, sex, height, weight, sport/PE, one-year injury history, adherence (weekly sessions) to NMT, and balance ability (timed single-leg on balance pad). Generalized estimating equation analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with clustering on team/class, exchangeable correlation structure, robust variance estimator, and offset for exposure hours. <h3>Results</h3> Adjusting for age, balance, injury history, sex and sport/PE, balance ability reduced the odds of injury [OR=0.955, (95%CI: 0.912–0.999)]. Predictors of non-response include previous injury [OR=1.895, (95%CI: 1.335–2.691), female sex [OR=1.595, (95%CI: 1.119–2.274), and playing basketball [OR=3.151, (95%CI: 1.616–6.142)]. Stratifying by sex, weekly NMT sessions did not predict injury in females, however injury history [OR=2.148, (95% CI: 1.394–3.311)] and basketball [OR=3.677, (95% CI: 1.558–8.679)] were associated with increased odds. Stratifying by sex and sport, female soccer players had lower odds associated with greater weekly mean NMT sessions [OR=0.282, (95%CI: 0.090–0.882)]. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Predictors of non-response to NMT in youth include being female, playing basketball, and history of injury. Better balance was associated with lower odds of injury. Higher weekly adherence was protective in female soccer players.",1

The purpose of the present study was to assess the biomechanics of trunk, pelvis, and lower extremities during a cutting maneuver under different foot progression angles.Nineteen male collegiate athletes (ages 18-24) participated in the present study. Cutting motion was analyzed using eight infrared cameras (250 Hz), two force plates (1250 Hz), and 44 reflective markers. Subjects performed 45-degree side cutting maneuvers under three foot progression angles, including 20 degrees (toe-out: TO), 0 degrees (neutral: TN), and - 20 degrees (toe-in: TI). Peak values of each biomechanical parameters in trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee within a first 40% stance phase and each parameter at the timing of the peak vertical ground reaction force were assessed. A statistical analysis was performed to compare data among the three-foot progression angles using the Friedman test.Peak angles of knee abduction, tibial internal rotation, hip internal rotation, and hip adduction were significantly greater for TI position than for TO position (p < 0.01). Peak moments of knee abduction and tibial internal rotation under TI position were also significantly larger than TO position (p < 0.01). Moreover, greater peak pelvis-trunk rotation was found for TI position than for TN and TO positions (p < 0.01).From the present study, TI position could lead to an increased risk of ACL injury during a pre-planned cut maneuver, compared to TO position.",1

McClelland, Adam I. Semciw, Anthony G. Schache, Alan McCall, Tania Pizzari","Abstract Background Despite calf muscle strain injuries (CMSI) being problematic in many sports, there is a dearth of research to guide clinicians dealing with these injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current practices and perspectives of a select group of international experts regarding the assessment, management and prevention of CMSI using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Results Twenty expert clinicians working in elite sport and/or clinician-researchers specialising in the field completed interviews. A number of key points emerged from the interviews. Characteristics of CMSI were considered unique compared to other muscle strains. Rigor in the clinical approach clarifies the diagnosis, whereas ongoing monitoring of calf capacity and responses to loading exposure provides the most accurate estimate of prognosis. Athlete intrinsic characteristics, injury factors and sport demands shaped rehabilitation across six management phases, which were guided by key principles to optimise performance at return to play (RTP) while avoiding subsequent injury or recurrence. To prevent CMSI, periodic monitoring is common, but practices vary and data are collected to inform load-management and exercise selection rather than predict future CMSI. A universal injury prevention program for CMSI may not exist. Instead, individualised strategies should reflect athlete intrinsic characteristics and sport demands. Conclusions Information provided by experts enabled a recommended approach to clinically evaluate CMSI to be outlined, highlighting the injury characteristics considered most important for diagnosis and prognosis. Principles for optimal management after CMSI were also identified, which involved a systematic approach to rehabilitation and the RTP decision. Although CMSI were reportedly difficult to prevent, on- and off-field strategies were implemented by experts to mitigate risk, particularly in susceptible athletes.",1

The athletic pubalgia is more common in male athletes as compare with female athletes. Most usually, men experience the ill effects of athletic pubalgia that expects athletes to perform sharps turns, cutting, turning and tedious kicking. The debilitating of posterior inguinal wall is the offender behind athletic pubalgia. It is caused by immoderate and disproportionate application of shear forces through the normal attachments of the abdominal muscles and hip adductors. At present there is no unanimity of assessment on the constituents of this analysis. Since, it is not difficult to characterize a reasonable finding that depends on actual assessment, the techniques, for example, symptomatic ultrasonography and MRI are regularly utilized essentially to offset the presence of different conditions. This is high an ideal opportunity for committed research work on outcome estimation of chronic athletes and furthermore putting together its prosperity totally with respect to reasonable for getting back to sports action. Furthermore, it is likewise needed to have point by point depictions of the techniques, surgical anatomy, conventional treatment and recovery. The data acquired from such an research work will help in understanding pathogenesis of athletic pubalgia in a superior manner, develop proof arranged screening and check for better surgical techniques and successfully oversee both post-surgical and conservative recovery.",1

However, this positive trend towards gender equity in sports has not transpired for women in medicine, especially in fields that care for elite athletes. This current review will discuss specific areas that can be tailored to help female athletes prevent injuries and optimize their athletic performance. We will also highlight how increased female team physician representation in sports may help optimize care for female athletes. Recent Findings Female athletes are considered high risk for certain conditions such as ACL tears, patellofemoral pain syndrome, bone stress injuries, sport-related concussions, and sexual violence in sport. Addressing factors specific to female athletes has been found to be valuable in preventing injuries. Strength and conditioning can optimize athletic performance but remains underutilized among female athletes. Although diversity in healthcare workforce has been found to be beneficial for multiple reasons, women remain underrepresented in sports medicine. Increasing female team physician representation may positively impact care for female athletes. Summary Team physicians must understand the physiologic, biomechanical, and anatomic factors that are unique to female athletes in order to tailor injury prevention programs and optimize their athletic performance. Advocating for gender equity in sports medicine to advance representation of women in the field will increase workforce diversity and promote excellence in sports medicine care.",1

Collectively, the findings were highly inconsistent, and a clear statement on the association between each asymmetry and sport injury was difficult.Highly inconsistent findings make it difficult to create clear recommendations on the relationship between the inter-limb asymmetry in lower-limb functional performance (power, muscle flexibility, and dynamic balance) and sport injury. The influence of potential factors (selection of tests/parameters, participant characteristics, definition of injury, and ways of calculating asymmetry) should be considered when using previous findings.",1

Part II: Intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors,2022-01-11,2022,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Mauro Mandorino, Antonio J. Figueiredo, Masar Gjaka, Antonio Tessitore","Injury is defined as a complex phenomenon determined by the non-linear interaction of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The objective of the present study was to perform a systematic literature review on the injury risk factors in young soccer players. After electronic database searching, articles in line with the inclusion criteria were selected for the systematic review. Injury risk factor data were extracted and grouped in intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. The main findings of the current review are as follows: (1) alteration in neuromuscular control such as limb asymmetry and dynamic knee valgus are important intrinsic risk factors; (2) maturation status may impair neuromuscular control and increase the risk of injury; (3) fatigue and poor recovery contribute to the onset of overuse injuries; (4) the impact of anthropometric factors is still unclear; (5) previous injuries increase the risk of re-injuries; (6) highly skilled players are more exposed to risk of injuries; (7) high external workloads increase the risk of injuries; (8) playing position, as well as sport specialization, exposes young soccer players to greater injury risk. Many factors (e.g., neuromuscular control, training load, maturity status) can modify the susceptibility to injury in young soccer players. Being aware of the complex interaction between these factors is essential to identify players at higher risk of injury, develop adequate prevention strategies, and from a scientific point of view move from a reductionist to a complex system approach.",1

This study aimed to determine if a body tempering intervention would be appropriate pre-exercise by examining its effects on perceived soreness, range of motion (ROM), and force production compared to an intervention of traditional stretching. The subjects for this study were ten Division 1 (D1) football linemen from Sacred Heart University (Age: 19.9 ± 1.5 years, body mass: 130.9 ± 12.0 kg, height: 188.4 ± 5.1 cm, training age: 8.0 ± 3.5 years). Subjects participated in three sessions with the first session being baseline testing. The second and third sessions involved the participants being randomized to receive either the body tempering or stretching intervention for the second session and then receiving the other intervention the final week. Soreness using a visual analog scale (VAS), ROM, counter movement jump (CMJ) peak force and jump height, static jump (SJ) peak force and jump height, and isometric mid-thigh pull max force production were assessed. The results of the study concluded that body tempering does not have a negative effect on muscle performance but did practically reduce perceived muscle soreness. Since body tempering is effective at reducing soreness in athletes, it can be recommended for athletes as part of their pre-exercise warmup without negatively effecting isometric or dynamic force production.",1

J Strength Cond Res 36(5): 1238–1244, 2022—Reactive strength index (RSI) during a single-leg drop jump (SLDJ) has been indicated to determine return-to-sport readiness after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, but only cross-sectional studies are available. Ground reaction force data and characterization of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function also remain sparse. Single-leg drop jump performance, ground reaction force, and SSC function were examined in soccer players with ACL reconstruction ( n = 26) and matched controls ( n = 25). Injured players were tested at 2 time points (32 and 42 weeks postsurgery). Stretch-shortening cycle function was classified as good (no impact peak and spring like), moderate (impact peak but still spring like or no impact peak and not spring like), or poor (impact peak and not spring like). The involved limb displayed lower-jump height, poorer RSI, less spring-like behavior, earlier peak landing force, and a greater ratio of landing peak to take-off peak force compared with the uninvolved limb and controls at the initial assessment ( p &lt; 0.001). Proportionally, more involved limbs were categorized as poor or moderate at the initial assessment (69.2%) and follow-up (50%) in comparison with the control limbs (14%). The reactive strength index was the only variable to change significantly between the initial assessment and follow-up on the involved limb ( p &lt; 0.05). No changes in the proportion of ACL reconstructed individuals categorized as poor or moderate SSC function at the follow-up assessment were observed. Residual deficits are present in SLDJ performance, SSC function, and ground reaction force characteristics after ACL reconstruction. The reactive strength index should not be the sole metric, as observed increases did not correspond with changes in SSC function.",1
Are cam morphology size and location associated with self‐reported burden in football players with FAI syndrome?,2022-01-03,2022,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Mark J. Scholes, Joanne L. Kemp, Benjamin F. Mentiplay, Joshua J. Heerey, Rintje Agricola, Matthew G. King, Adam I. Semciw, Peter R. Lawrenson, Kay M. Crossley","Cam morphology size and location might affect the severity of reported burden in people with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. We investigated the relationship between cam morphology size (i.e., alpha angle) and self-reported hip/groin burden (i.e., scores for the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 (iHOT-33) and Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS)), examined separately for the anteroposterior pelvis (AP) and Dunn 45° radiographs in football players with FAI syndrome. In total, 118 (12 women) subelite football (soccer or Australian football) players with FAI syndrome with cam morphology (alpha angle ≥60°) participated. One blinded assessor quantified superior and anterosuperior cam morphology size by measuring alpha angles for the AP and Dunn 45° radiographs, respectively. Linear regression models investigated relationships between alpha angle (continuous independent variable, separately measured for the AP and Dunn 45° radiographs) and iHOT-33 and HAGOS scores (dependent variables). Larger anterosuperior cam morphology (seen on the Dunn 45° radiograph) was associated with lower (i.e., worse) scores for the iHOT-Total, iHOT-Symptoms, iHOT-Job, and iHOT-Social subscales (unadjusted estimate range -0.553 to -0.319 [95% confidence interval -0.900 to -0.037], p = 0.002 to 0.027), but not the iHOT-Sport (p = 0.459) nor any HAGOS scores (p = 0.110 to 0.802). Superior cam morphology size (measured using the AP radiograph) was not associated with any iHOT-33 or HAGOS scores (p = 0.085 to 0.975). Larger anterosuperior cam morphology may be more relevant to pain and symptoms in football players with FAI syndrome than superior cam morphology, warranting investigation of its effects on reported burden and hip disease over time.",1
Image Guided Injection of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears with Autologous Bone Marrow Concentrate and Platelets: Midterm Analysis from A Randomized Controlled Trial,2022-01-02,2022,"Dougmar Publishing Group, Inc.",Biologic Orthopedics Journal,"Christopher Centeno, Matthew Lucas, Ian Stemper, Ehren Dodson","Background: There has been a recent emergence in the use of orthobiologics, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC), in the treatment of various musculoskeletal conditions. The goal of this study was to determine if injection of BMC and platelet products into partial and full-thickness anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears can facilitate primary ligament healing in patients failing conservative care, resulting in improved outcomes compared to exercise therapy.Methods: Patients were randomized to either exercise therapy or percutaneous injection of autologous BMC with PRP and platelet lysate into the ACL under fluoroscopic guidance. Pain and function were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Baseline and 6-month post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained to evaluate interval healing. Laxity was assessed using the Telos device.Results: There was significant improvement in functional outcomes in the BMC group, compared to base-line for LEFS at time points 3 up to 24 months s = 0.000000005), and significant improvement in pain in the BMC group at 6 (p = 0.00054), 12 (p = 0.00127), and 24 months (p = 0.002). There was no significant improvement in pain or function at any time point in the exercise therapy group. There was significant improvement in ACL MRI ImageJ quantitative assessment in the BMC group (p = 0.001) and no difference in the exercise group (p &gt; 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported.Conclusion: Autologous BMC and platelet product injection into ACL tears improved patient function compared to exercise, observed through 24 months. Patients treated with BMC demonstrated quantitative improvements in post-treatment MRI scans suggestive of interval ligament healing.",1
Contemporary Principles for Postoperative Rehabilitation and Return to Sport for Athletes Undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2022-01-01,2022,Elsevier BV,"Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation","Charles R. Badawy, Kyleen Jan, Edward C. Beck, Niles Fleet, Jeffrey Taylor, Kevin Ford, Brian R. Waterman","Despite advancements in our understanding of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention and nonsurgical management, ACL reconstruction continues to occur at an alarming rate. Among athletic patients, individuals participating in basketball, soccer, and football have the highest incidence of ACL injury, often requiring surgical intervention. To ensure the optimal treatment strategy for return to sport and prevention of secondary graft re-tear, it is important to tailor to the specific demands of the injured athlete and apply evidence-based best practices and rehabilitation principles. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with a brief background regarding ACL injuries, a focused review of clinical outcome studies after ACL reconstruction, and an updated framework with expert-guided recommendations for postoperative rehabilitation and return to sporting activity. Currently, there is no gold standard for rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction, highlighting the need for robust studies evaluating the best modalities for athlete rehabilitation, as well as determining the efficacy of new tools for improving therapy including blood flow restriction therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Based on clinical experience, a renewed focus on objective, criteria-based milestones may maximize the ability of return to preinjury levels of athletic function.",1
"Can complex contrast training interventions improve aerobic endurance, maximal strength, and repeated sprint ability in soccer players? A systematic review and meta-analysis",2022-01-01,2022,Montenegrin Sports Academy,Montenegrin Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,"Rohit K. Thapa, Pushpendra Narvariya, Anthony Weldon, Kaushik Talukdar, Rodrigo Ramirez-Campillo","This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of complex contrast training (CT) on aero- bic endurance, maximal strength, and repeated sprint ability (RSA) in soccer players. After an electronic search, nine peer-reviewed articles were considered, including soccer players from junior to professional-level (age 14 – 23 years). One study was conducted during the pre-season, seven studies during the in-season, and one study during the off-season period of a competitive schedule. The studies included were of moderate to high meth- odological quality (PEDro scale) and incorporated CT with soccer practice. Large significant improvements (ES = 1.30; 95% CI = 0.61 – 2.00; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 80.6%) for maximal strength, and small non-significant improve- ments for aerobic endurance (ES = 0.33; 95% CI = -0.19 – 0.85; p = 0.209; I2 = 0.0%) and RSA (ES = 0.32; 95% CI = -0.12 – 0.75; p = 0.156; I2 = 0.0%) were noted for CT groups when compared to active or specific-active control groups. Therefore, supplementing regular soccer training with CT induces adaptations to improve maximal strength. CT may be implemented during the pre-season and in-season to induce adaptations similar to tradi- tional strength training (e.g., maximal strength gains), although alternative training strategies may be needed to further improve aerobic endurance and RSA. The use of CT may be applicable during different periods of the season to achieve certain goals, e.g., pre- and in-season for maximal strength development, and off-season to attenuate the decline of strength or power.",1
Assessment of brain injury biomechanics in soccer heading using finite element analysis,2022-01-01,2022,Elsevier BV,Brain Multiphysics,"Richard A. Perkins, Amirhamed Bakhtiarydavijani, Athena E. Ivanoff, Michael Jones, Youssef Hammi, Raj K. Prabhu","This study presents an in silico finite element (FE) model-based biomechanical analysis of brain injury metrics and associated risks of a soccer ball impact to the head for aware and unaware athletes, considering ball impact velocity and direction. The analysis presented herein implements a validated soccer ball and 50th percentile human head computational FE model for quantifying traumatic brain injury (TBI) metrics. The brain's mechanical properties are designated using a viscoelastic-viscoplastic constitutive material model for the white and gray matter within the human head FE model. FE results show a dynamic human head-soccer ball peak contact area of approximately seven times greater than those documented for helmet-to-helmet hits in American Football. Due to the deformable nature of the soccer ball, the impact dynamics are unique depending on the location and velocity of impact. TBI injury risks also depend on the location of impact and the impact velocity. Impacts to the rear (BrIC:0.48, HIC15:180.7), side (BrIC:0.52, HIC15:176.5), and front (BrIC:0.37, HIC15:129.0) are associated with the highest injury risks. Furthermore, the FE results indicate when an athlete is aware of an incoming ball, HIC15-based Abbreviated Injury Scale 1 (AIS 1) injury risks for the front, side, and rear impacts decrease from 10.5%, 18.5%, and 19.3%, respectively, to approximately 1% in front and side impacts and under 6% in a rear impact. Lastly, the unique contact area between the head and soccer ball produces pressure gradients in the ball that translate into distinguishable stress waves in the skull and the cerebral cortex.",1

Acute effects of resisted and assisted locomotor activation on sprint performance,2022-01-01,2022,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Biology of Sport,"Aleksander Matusiński, Artur Gołas, Adam Zajac, Adam Maszczyk","Sprinting speed is one of the most significant motor abilities in team sport games and all sprint, hurdling and jumping events in athletics. Over the years numerous methods and devices have been developed to improve sprinting performance. One of the most effective methods of developing sprinting speed includes resisted sprinting with the use of different towing devices, parachutes, uphill running, and now intelligent drag technology. Resisted sprinting can be used for chronic changes in performance or for acute enhancement of running speed through locomotor post-activation. The other method of enhancing sprinting speed includes assisted sprinting in which the objective is to achieve supramaximal speed through high speed treadmill running, downhill sprinting, the use of elastic tubing or different towing mechanisms. The main objectives of this research were to determine the acute effects of resisted and assisted sprint activation on sprinting performance in male and female sprinters. Eleven, international and national level 200-400 m sprinters, 6 female and 5 male, participated in the study. The study protocol had a crossover design, with the activation protocol for both days consisting of either 3 × 30 m resisted sprints or 3 × 40 m assisted sprints. At baseline, and following the activation protocol, all athletes performed a 50 m maximum sprint, measured electronically with photocells from a crouched start. During particular trials, the SPRINT 1080 engine assisted measuring system was used with the load set individually to 10% BM. During the resisted and assisted PAP intervention the results of intragroup ANOVA revealed significant differences between resisted baseline results and resisted post activation results in the 10 m and 50 m test trials in men (respectively p = 0.002, η2 = 0.25; p = 0.001, η2 = 0.45), as well as in the group of female sprinters at these distances (10 m and 50 m) (respectively p = 0.002, η2 = 0.20; p = 0.001, η2 = 0.29). There were no statistically significant improvements in the 10 and 50 m test trials following assisted activation for both female and male sprinters. It was concluded that resisted sprint activation with a load of 10% BM enhances sprinting speed over 50 m in elite male and female sprinters.",1
A Multi-Systems Approach to Human Movement after ACL Reconstruction: The Nervous System,2022-01-01,2022,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,"Meredith Chaput, Brandon M Ness, Kathryn Lucas, Kory J Zimney","Postoperative rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction mainly focuses on the restoration of strength and range of motion with a long-term goal to return athletes to their prior level of activity. Of those wanting to return to sport, many are either unable and/or experience protracted recovery despite extensive rehabilitation. To holistically care for patients recovering from ACL reconstructions, reframing rehabilitation to consider a comprehensive systems approach (including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurologic systems) may help improve treatment outcomes. The American Physical Therapy Association has adopted a vision statement that embraces the concept of a 'movement system,' but validation of the movement system has been challenging. Application of a multi-physiologic systems approach may provide a unique perspective to better understand the nervous system and its interactions after ACL reconstruction. The purpose is to focus on the nervous system contributions to a multi-physiologic system approach to rehabilitation from ACL reconstruction. 5.",1

Methods: Three Databases, PUBMED, SCOPUS, and SCIELO, were used to search for a scientific publication. The criterions adopted were: a) published in a peer-reviewed journal; b) adopted at least one manipulation check related to mental fatigue; c) mental fatigue induced by a cognitive task before the outcome task, and d) study participants were ball sports athletes. Result: The quality of this narrative review was rated at 11 (SANRA scale 0-12), and the papers analyzed were published between 2015 and 2022. Twenty-one experimental studies were included in this review. Most studies were in invasion sports (n = 13; 72%), and non-ecological tasks were used to induce mental fatigue (n = 15; 83%). Regarding performance in endurance tests, mentally fatigued athletes had performance impaired. However, when assessed during a small-sided or simulated game, data were inconclusive within the literature. Moreover, athletes presented attenuated perceptual skills (e.g., visual field). Consequently, this worsened motor skills, technical-tactical performances, and tactical behavior. Conclusions: Cognitively demanding tasks should be avoided before training and sports competitions because they can lead the athlete to mental fatigue and impair performance. This impairment is identified in physical performance (endurance tasks) and technical and tactical performance. Finally, it is recommended that athletes do not perform tasks that cause mental fatigue 2 h before the sports event.",1

Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 42 female professional basketball players (age: 19-25 years) were assigned to three groups of Neuromuscular (NM), Strength (ST), and Combined training (CM), and one control group. The Multivariate Analysis of the Variance (MANOVA) was used to compare between-groups data. Dynamic balance and performance measurements (vertical jump, agility, and sprint) of athletes were assessed before and after six weeks of intervention by Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), Sargent vertical jump device, Shuttle Run device, and sprint 27-meter test. Results: Results of the MANOVA showed all between-group differences for dynamic balance, sprint, and agility were only significant between the control group and NM, ST, and CM groups (P≤0.05). In addition, the CM group was significantly different compared to the NM and ST groups (P≤0.05). Balance and high jump within-group differences showed a significant increase in the NM, ST, and CM groups in the high jump variable (P≤0.05). For sprint and agility, within-group results showed a significant decrease in the NM, ST, and CM groups (P≤0.05). Besides, the larger effect size was seen in the combined group for all variables. Conclusion: It seems that neuromuscular, strength, and combined training is similarly effective in improving the balance and functional performance of female basketball athletes and there is not a significant difference between them.",1
"The Effect of Core Strength Training on 14-Year-Old Soccer Players&amp;apos; Agility, Anaerobic Power, and Speed",2022-01-01,2022,Science Publishing Group,American Journal of Sports Science,Melese Ebabu Mossa,"The football players must be physically fit, technically adept, strategically well-equipped, and mentally prepared to withstand the pressures of the game. Among those essential components, physical fitness is the basis. So, coaches implemented aerobics, strength, and power training for large muscle groups. However, the core muscles, which assist maintain balance, transform stored energy into explosive strength, and enable robust kicking and leaping activities, have received little attention. The goal of this study is to investigate how core strength training improves soccer players' agility, muscular power, and speed. We utilized a true patterned experimental design and randomly selected 13 players as the control group (CG) and 13 players as the experimental group (EG). A pre-test was conducted by both groups' players (agility, anaerobic power and speed tests). In addition to the standard soccer training program, the EG was utilized for core strength training twice a week for three months, for 30 to 35 minutes each day. The coach only implemented regular soccer training on the CG. We repeated the measurements three months later on the same parameter. And agility grew considerably (MD in TT of EG was 0.738) at P = 0.000, the difference between MD in TT of CG 0.3769 at P = 0.005 and MD in TT of CG 0.3769 at P = 0.005 is reasonably significant. IAT's pre- and post-test mean of EG and CG do not differ significantly, other than their great improvement. However, both groups' IAT results improved significantly (MD and P value of EG in was significantly decreased by a MD of 0.381, P 0.00. and 0.3685, P 0.017 in case of CG). EG’s anaerobic power (before and after MD and P value in VJT) was .06 at P = 0.000, which was larger than CG's MD of .0254 at P = .038. Furthermore, the pre and post MD and P values in the SLJT of EG and CG are .1161 at P = 0.003 and .0308 at P = .052, respectively. Furthermore, in the 10m dash test of EG and CG, the MD and P value of the speed test were .1392 at P .020 and .1206 at P .020, respectively. In the 40-meter dash speed test, EG and CG had pre and post MD of .2015 at P .008 and .1293 at P .010, respectively. Generally, three months of core strength training increased the speed, power, and agility of 14-year-old EG much more than CG.",1
From Traditional Approach to Ecological Dynamics Approach with the Italian Young Soccer Players,2022-01-01,2022,"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.",Advances in Physical Education,Italo Sannicandro,"The team sports are looking for a methodology capable of structuring more effectively the prerequisites necessary for the training of the future athlete/player. In recent years in the field of motor activities, methodological research has made it possible to outline new approaches aimed at involving the cognitive area together with the motor one. For many years, the demand for motor tasks in analytic form prevailed over other modes of presentation of the motor and technical task. This belief was due to linear motion patterns that were popular in motor behavior theories from the 1960s to 2000s and which somehow still prevail in current practice. However, the demands of mastering a soccer game require much more than just physical or technical skill. In fact, in sports open skills the perceptual, decisional and cognitive aspects play a very significant role in solving motor problems. This study describes the methodological paradigm change in the model of youth soccer starting in Italy, and aims to describe methods of intervention and phases that distinguish it from the traditional approach.",1

Estimation of gender-specific ACL forces in the frontal plane can provide a better understanding of the biomechanical patterns underlying higher female injury risk. The present study used a sample from the Fels Longitudinal Study to test the hypothesis that there are significant gender-differences in frontal plane ACL loading during walking. A cross-sectional sample of 178 participants, including 79 males and 99 females was used to evaluate differences in gait kinetics. Females walked at higher cadence with narrower steps (P &lt; 0.05). No difference was observed in the peak flexion force and knee rotation moment between males and females (P = 0.51 and 0.07), respectively. Peak abduction moment was significantly lower among females than in males (P = 0.05). A regression equation was developed which considers a person’s weight and height in addition to forces which could give better estimate of the forces acting on the ligament. The peak force acting on the ACL during walking reaches as high as 0.44 of BW, regardless of gender.",1

The countermovement jump (CMJ) is one of the most commonly applied jump tests for assessing the mechanical capacities of the lower extremities. The KForce Plates system is a portable force platform that sends action-time audio and visual biofeedback to a smartphone or tablet through the KForce application, making it a suitable instrument for assessing the CMJ. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the test–retest reliability and validity of the portable force platform (KForce Plates) in the evaluation of the CMJ in collegiate athletes compared to a validated application, My Jump 2. Thirty-four collegiate professional athletes, deriving from various sports backgrounds, participated in the present study. The CMJs were reported with the portable KForce Plates and the simultaneous use of the ‘My Jump 2’ application using an iPhone 13 between days 1 and 7. Our findings revealed high test–retest reliability (ICC = 1.00 and ICC = 0.99) in-between measurements. High correlations were monitored amongst the portable KForce plates and the My Jump 2 application for measuring the CMJ (r = 0.999, p = 0.001). The Bland–Altman plot exhibits the limits of agreement amongst the portable KForce plates and the My Jump 2 application, where the bulk of the data are within the 95% CIs with an agreement of ≈1 cm. Our findings suggest that the portable KForce Plates system is a reliable and valid instrument and, therefore, can be used by experts in the sports field.",1
Effect of lace-up ankle brace on the tibiotalar and subtalar joint during the landing,2023-10-12,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Ye Luo, Mengling Hu, Zhuman Li, Xiaofan Huang, Danni Wu, Feng Li, Shaobai Wang","Objective: Ankle braces can affect the kinematics of the ankle joint during landing tasks. Previous studies were primarily relied on traditional marker-based motion capture systems, which pose limitations in non-invasively capturing the motion of the talus bone. The effect of ankle braces on the in vivo kinematics of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints during landing remains unknown. This study used a high-speed dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate effect of ankle braces on the in vivo kinematics of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints during landing. Methods: Fourteen healthy participants were recruited for this study. During the experiment, static three-dimensional MRI data were collected for each participant, and 3D ankle joint models for the calcaneus, talus, and tibia were constructed. The DFIS was used to capture the images of each participant performing a single-leg landing-jump task at a height of 40 cm. The images were captured once with and without a brace in the fatigue condition, which was induced by running. The six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) kinematic data were obtained by 2D-3D registration. Results: The flexion-extension range of motion (ROM) (42.73 ± 4.76° vs. 38.74 ± 5.43°, p = 0.049) and anterior-posterior translation ROM (16.86 ± 1.74 mm vs. 15.03 ± 1.73 mm, p = 0.009) of the tibiotalar joint were decreased. The maximum inversion angle (−3.71 ± 2.25° vs. 2.11 ± 1.83°, p = 0.047) of the subtalar joint was decreased. Conclusion: The ankle brace limited the flexion-extension ROM of the tibiotalar joints and the inversion angle of the subtalar joint during landing.",1

These exercises are incorporated as an integral part of a currently used training protocol. Objective: To review the main effects of NT on injury prevention in soccer players and its impact on related physical performance. Methods: Review of the literature describing different studies on NT in soccer. The following databases were used to search and retrieve the scientific articles: PubMed, Scopus, and Ebsco. Combinations of the following keywords were used to perform the search (“neuromuscular training” OR “proprioceptive training” OR “sensorimotor training”) AND (“soccer” OR “football” OR “soccer players” OR “football players”). Results: A positive trend is observed in NT for the prevention of knee and ankle injuries, in addition to improving muscle strength and motor skills such as agility and coordination. Conclusion: This review managed to identify that NT is effective in reducing the risk of injury in soccer players; however, the literature has mainly addressed lower extremity injuries. Therefore, it may be necessary for future investigations to focus on the upper extremity and trunk. Likewise, it was determined that NT has a potential impact on improving physical performance, with the variables of strength, power, speed, agility, and balance being the most studied.",1

The normal distribution of continuous variables was analysed by Shapiro Wilk-W test, Kolmogorov Simirnov test, Q-Q graph, skewness and kurtosis. According to the results, it was determined that there was a statistical difference in favour of defenders in the pressure parameter in the L2 and L5 sensors inside the foot and in the L2 sensor outside the foot, in favour of forwards in the L6 sensor above the foot, in favour of forwards in the technical score parameter the second score when kicking the ball outside the foot and in the total score outside the foot, in the knee and hip strength parameter, in the peak torque extension movement in the hip joint, in favour of forwards. As a result, it is seen that the strikers who participated in the study are better in both technical scoring and hip strength in line with the needs of the position they play compared to other positions.",1
Influence of a football match on landing biomechanics and jump performance in female football players,2023-10-12,2023,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Aaron Miralles‐Iborra, Jose L. L. Elvira, Juan Del Coso, Sergio Hernandez‐Sanchez, Jose Pino‐Ortega, Victor Moreno‐Pérez","Abstract This study aimed to assess the acute effect of a competitive football match on jump performance and kinematic parameters during jump landing in semiprofessional female football players. Twenty‐two semiprofessional players (20 ± 3 years) underwent a drop jump task for a posterior video analysis of the landing phase. These measurements were obtained at (1) baseline, (2) after, and (3) 48 h after a competitive football match. A one‐way ANOVA with repeated measures was employed to detect differences over the time. There was a main effect of time for maximal knee flexion angle during drop landing ( p = 0.001). In comparison with baseline, maximal knee flexion angle was reduced immediately post‐match and was still reduced 48 h after the match (63.4 ± 8.6 vs 57.0 ± 11.7 vs 48.9 ± 19.1, p ≤ 0.038). There was also a main effect of time for drop jump height ( p &lt; 0.001). Drop jump height was reduced immediately post‐match and remained low 48 h after the match in comparison with baseline (27.3 ± 3.6 vs 24.5 ± 2.8 ~ 25.5 ± 3.0 cm, p ≤ 0.002). There was a main effect of time on hip flexion angle during landing ( p = 0.001), but the pairwise comparison revealed that this variable was not affected immediately post‐match but was lower 48 h after the match than at baseline (50.1 ± 10.1 ~ 50.8 ± 13.2 vs 38.1 ± 17.8 °, p ≤ 0.005). A competitive football match worsened jump performance and several landing biomechanical parameters in female football players, which were still decreased in comparison with baseline even 48 h after the match.",1
Injuries in professional women’s elite soccer players in Kosovo: epidemiological injury study,2023-10-12,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Feim Gashi, Tine Kovačič, Ismet Shalaj, Bekim Haxhiu, Arben Boshnjaku","Abstract Background An emphasis has been given lately towards women’s engagement together with their potential in soccer. As this sport develops with athletes becoming more physically fit and skilled, it is unclear what the consequences in terms of injuries are. Having this in mind, this study aimed to investigate the major injuries that occur in women’s soccer players. Methods This descriptive epidemiological study invited all 286 women’s soccer players from the 12 participating women clubs in the Kosovo 1st Soccer League (elite football level) during the 2021/2022 season, out of which 142 from 12 clubs participated. Exposure time for 1000 h of playing and training were recorded in addition to the anthropometric data, playing position, and prior injury history during the end of the season, practice, and match. The exact type of injury, severity, and post-injury recovery time, as well as the circumstances surrounding the injuries, were recorded. Results In total 84 injuries were registered with an overall injury ratio (IR) being 3.21 (CI: 2.56, 3.98) injuries/1000 exposure hours. During the competitive season, each player sustained 1.4 injuries on average. IRs were significantly higher during competition (n = 50; IR = 1.57; CI: 1.52, 1.62) compared to training (n = 34; IR = 0.26, CI: 0.25, 0.27). Out of a total of 142 women players, 84 (59.2%) injuries occurred, and no record of injuries was made in 58 (40.8%) players. The overall IR was observed to be 3.21 (CI: 1.24, 3.27), with moderate and severe injuries accounting for 38.1% of total injuries (each), followed by mild (16.7%) and minimal (7.1%) injuries. Conclusion The women IR in Kosovo women’s soccer players is low while being circa 11% below the international average. Almost 2 out of every 4 injuries were categorized as traumatic, with the IRs being more than 5-fold larger during games than during training. Additionally, these findings emphasize the higher rate of injuries amongst younger athletes, suggesting caution to be taken by the coaches when planning for the match. The collected data may help coaches and trainers create more targeted women’s soccer injury prevention programs.",1
The Football Players on Plyometric Exercise: A Systematic Review,2023-10-11,2023,JURUFRA SL,Retos,"Awang Firmansyah, Muhammad Reza Aziz Prasetya, Muchamad Arif Al Ardha, Novadri Ayubi, Andika Bayu Putro, Toho Cholik Mutohir, Josè V Garcia Jimenez, Yulingga Nanda Hanief","Achieving peak performance in sports necessitates athletes having a high level of physical fitness. Among the key physical components, both overall fitness and movement fitness play significant roles in competitive sports, particularly those involving muscles. Football, a globally popular sport, demands explosive movements like kicking, tackling, jumping, sprinting, and rapid changes in direction. Training effectiveness is crucial for attaining success in football matches. This paper focuses on investigating studies that utilize plyometric training to enhance football performance. In order to search for articles, using the keywords plyometric training, physical fitness, performance football by using database from Google Scholar, PubMed Central, and Science Direct. 13 articles were obtained and analyzed from 2013 to 2022. Search results were arranged based on the format of P (Population), I (Intervention), C (Comparison), O (Outcome). A review of 13 articles concluded that there was an improved level of agility, speed, strength, explosive power, physical fitness, aerobic endurance, acceleration power, on the physical performance of football players. The goals and demands of each training session must be adapted through plyometric training, and each exercise can then be performed regularly to reduce the possibility of injury. Based on the results of the review, plyometric training has been extensively studied to understand its impact on football players. The training program, lasting 6-10 weeks with 2-3 sessions per week, can enhance physical performance by increasing explosive lower body strength, specific physical abilities, and endurance. Plyometric exercises come in different intensity levels, such as low, moderate, and high, and positively affect leg strength, explosive speed, power, aerobic capacity, body composition, flexibility, and muscle endurance in elite athletes and can be customized to target specific goals like speed or strength enhancement, benefiting football players.

Correlation between momentum and ball speed in shooting movements of female futsal players,2023-10-08,2023,Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia,SPORT TK-Revista EuroAmericana de Ciencias del Deporte,"Agustiyanta, Satria Yudi Gontara, Rumi Iqbal Doewes, Ahmad Septiandika Adirahma","The purpose of this study was to find a correlation between momentum and ball speed in the shooting movements of female futsal players. This study used a correlational research design. Five female futsal players (aged 19) participating in this study performed shooting movements, which were recorded on video for analysis. The shooting movements of female futsal players were analyzed based on swing movements, foot contact with the ball, and body position. Pearson correlation test was used for data analysis. The results showed that the average magnitude of momentum (impact from foot contact with the ball) was 8.14±4.68 Ns and resulted in an average ball speed of 18.51±10.63 m/s. There is a relationship between the amount of momentum and the resulting ball speed (sig &lt; 0.05). The correlation was positive, which shows the direction of a positive relationship so that the greater the momentum, the faster the ball speed. The greatest momentum is 16.49 Ns resulting in the highest ball speed of 37.48 m/s. To generate great momentum and the highest ball speed, the shooting movement is carried out with a backswing flexion angle of 106°, a kicking leg angle of 57°, and a hip and shoulder tilt angle of 14°.",1
Infrared thermography in the diagnosis of Achilles tendinitis.

It is involved in daily functioning and sports activities performance. Exposure to excessive stress on the calcaneus tendon (CT) can prevent an effective repair process and favor permanent injuries. Tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome resulting from disorientation of AT fibers, and inflammatory signs characteristic of tendinitis or tissue degeneration present in tendinosis can be found. The condition can manifest itself through functional changes accompanied by clinical signs such as crackling, tenderness, pain and edema. Infrared thermography is used to trace thermographic profiles, capable of detecting thermal changes related to pathologies. Objectives: The main goal of this study was to correlate AT region thermograms with clinical and functional characteristics in healthy individuals with CT pathology. Methods: The present work consists of a double-blind pilot randomized trial, of qualitative and quantitative nature. Individuals with TC tendinopathy, classified in the Tendinopathy Group (TG) and individuals without tendinopathy, classified in the Control Group (CG) participated. Assessments were performed to characterize the subjects belonging to the TG and CG: anamnesis, infrared thermography, referred pain, crepitation and thickness on palpation, algometry, arch sign test and Royal London Hospital test, pain on passive dorsiflexion, pain on lifting the heel and long jump. Results: The results obtained in infrared thermography were consistent with those obtained in the clinical evaluation for TG and GC. The results demonstrate that healthy tendons presented an average temperature difference of 0.24 ± 0.15 ºC between legs with a maximal difference of 0.4 ºC. On the other hand, unilateral tendinopathy presented an average temperature difference of 1.2 ± 0.9 ºC, however, this difference could be as big as 5.1 ºC. Conclusion: It is concluded that infrared thermography can be used safely and non-invasively to aid in the diagnosis of Achilles tendon tendinopathy.",1
Short-Term Effects of Lower-Extremity Heavy Resistance versus High-Impact Plyometric Training on Neuromuscular Functional Performance of Professional Soccer Players,2023-10-04,2023,MDPI AG,Sports,"Michał Boraczyński, José Magalhães, Jacek J. Nowakowski, James J. Laskin","To compare the effects of short-term 8 week heavy-resistance or plyometric training protocols (HRT or PLY) incorporated into regular soccer practice on measures of neuromuscular functional performance in professional soccer players, a single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted.Forty-seven participants aged 22.3 ± 3.52 years were assigned to three groups: HRT (n = 15), PLY (n = 15), and control (CON; n = 17). The HRT group performed 3 sets and 10 repetitions twice a week using 80% of their baseline 1-RM (weeks 1-3), followed by 8 repetitions at 85% 1-RM (weeks 4-6), and 6 repetitions at 90% 1-RM (weeks 7-8) of 6 lower-body strength exercises with a 1 min rest period between sets. The PLY protocol involved a preparatory phase (weeks 1-2), followed by two 3-week progressive periods (weeks 3-5 and weeks 6-8). The plyometric sessions consisted of four jump exercises/drills with progressively increasing number of sets and total number of foot contacts. The rest intervals between repetitions and sets were 15 and 90 s, respectively. Outcome measures included tests assessing 10 and 30 m speed (t10m and t30m), one-repetition maximum half-back squat (1-RM squat), isokinetic peak torques for the quadriceps and hamstring muscles (Qcon and Hcon), countermovement jump (CMJ), and squat jump (SJ).Two-way ANOVA detected main effects of time and group×time interactions for all examined variables, except t30m, 1-RM, and relative 1-RM. Post hoc analyses revealed significant increases in the HRT group (t10m: 6.3%, t30m: 7.1%; absolute 1-RM: 29.6%; relative 1-RM: 30.3%, Qcon: 24.5%; Hcon: 14.4%; CMJ: 5.9%; SJ: 7.2%, all p < 0.001) and the PLY group (t10m: 3.1%; t30m: 4.1%; absolute 1-RM:19.1%; relative 1-RM: 20.3%; Qcon: 12.6%; Hcon: 8.7%; CMJ: 3.3%; SJ: 3.5%, all p < 0.001). HRT was superior compared to PLY in relative 1-RM, Qcon and Hcon (all p < 0.001). In addition, we found knee muscular strength imbalance in 70.5% of participants from the total sample (H/Q ratio < 60%). The HRT and PLY protocols resulted in improved neuromuscular functional performance compared to the regular soccer regime.This study showed that during the pre-competitive season, additional HRT and PLY drills/exercises as a substitute for standard soccer training as part of a regular 90 min practice twice a week for 8 weeks, can produce acute physical performance-enhancing effects in professional soccer players.",1
Neuromuscular Response during Different Side-Cutting Maneuvers and Its Influence on the Risk of Knee Injuries,2023-10-03,2023,MDPI AG,Sports,"Adrián Feria-Madueño, Timothy E. Hewett, Alejandro Sánchez-Arteaga, Borja Sañudo","The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a customized exercise program on electromyographic (EMG) variables during side-cutting maneuvers.Fifty-seven physically active volunteers were recruited and randomized into two groups: a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG). The CG maintained their regular physical activity, while the EG followed an individualized, integrated exercise regimen that included strength, neuromuscular, proprioceptive, eccentric training, and whole-body vibration (WBV) exercises, lasting for 12 weeks. EMG-Root Means Square (RMS) values for the quadriceps (Q) and hamstrings (H) were measured immediately following initial foot contact at 50, 100, 150, and 200 milliseconds. Changes in EMG activity were evaluated before and after a twelve-week intervention, and the effect size (ES, 90% confidence limit [90%CL]) was calculated.The results showed that the EG participants exhibited enhanced co-contraction as measured by the hamstring/quadriceps ratio (H/Q ratio) during both open and cross-cutting side maneuvers after the twelve-week intervention.Furthermore, the customized, integrated exercise program that combined strength, neuromuscular, proprioceptive, eccentric training, and WBV exercises were could potentially serve as a beneficial neuromuscular and biomechanical strategy for addressing knee injury risk in non-professional, physically active populations at high risk for such injuries.",1
Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in female athletes,2023-10-01,2023,British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery,The Bone &amp; Joint Journal,"Fabio Mancino, Ayman Gabr, Ricci Plastow, Fares S. Haddad","The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is frequently injured in elite athletes, with females up to eight times more likely to suffer an ACL tear than males. Biomechanical and hormonal factors have been thoroughly investigated; however, there remain unknown factors that need investigation. The mechanism of injury differs between males and females, and anatomical differences contribute significantly to the increased risk in females. Hormonal factors, both endogenous and exogenous, play a role in ACL laxity and may modify the risk of injury. However, data are still limited, and research involving oral contraceptives is potentially associated with methodological and ethical problems. Such characteristics can also influence the outcome after ACL reconstruction, with higher failure rates in females linked to a smaller diameter of the graft, especially in athletes aged &lt; 21 years. The addition of a lateral extra-articular tenodesis can improve the outcomes after ACL reconstruction and reduce the risk of failure, and it should be routinely considered in young elite athletes. Sex-specific environmental differences can also contribute to the increased risk of injury, with more limited access to and availablility of advanced training facilities for female athletes. In addition, football kits are designed for male players, and increased attention should be focused on improving the quality of pitches, as female leagues usually play the day after male leagues. The kit, including boots, the length of studs, and the footballs themselves, should be tailored to the needs and body shapes of female athletes. Specific physiotherapy programmes and training protocols have yielded remarkable results in reducing the risk of injury, and these should be extended to school-age athletes. Finally, psychological factors should not be overlooked, with females’ greater fear of re-injury and lack of confidence in their knee compromising their return to sport after ACL injury. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors should be recognized and addressed to optimize the training programmes which are designed to prevent injury, and improve our understanding of these injuries.

"Kinematics, Kinetics and Muscle Activity Analysis during Single-leg Drop-jump Landing Followed by an Unanticipated Task: Focusing on Differences in Neurocognitive Function",2023-10-01,2023,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,"Satoshi Shibata, Masahiro Takemura, Shumpei Miyakawa","Background Lower neurocognitive function is a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, the mechanism by which lower neurocognitive function increases the risk of ACL injury remains unclear. Purpose To clarify the effect of differences in neurocognitive function on landing mechanics during a single-leg drop-jump landing motion followed by an unanticipated task. Study Design Cross-sectional study Methods Fifteen collegiate female athletes were recruited (20.1 ± 1.3 years, 166.6 ± 7.3 cm, 60.6 ± 6.9 kg) and were divided into two groups (the high-performance (HP) group and the lower-performance (LP) group) using the median Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score. Three-dimensional motion analysis was employed for the analysis during the experimental task of a single-leg drop-jump followed by an unanticipated landing task from a 30-cm high box. Joint angular changes of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee were calculated within the interval from initial contact (IC) to 40ms. Knee and hip moments were calculated as the maximum values within the interval from IC to 40ms. Surface electromyography data from key muscles were analyzed 50ms before and after IC. Independent t-tests were used to compare the effects of different neurocognitive function on the measurement items. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results The SDMT score was significantly higher in HP group (HP: 77.9 ± 5.5; LP: 66.0 ± 3.4; p &lt; 0.001). The LP group had a significantly greater trunk rotation angular change to the stance leg side (HP: 0.4 ± 0.8; LP: 1.2 ± 0.4; p = 0.020). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of joint moments, and muscle activities. Conclusion Differences in neurocognitive function by SDMT were found to be related to differences in motor strategies of the trunk in the horizontal plane. Although trunk motion in the sagittal and frontal planes during single-leg drop-jump landing increases the ACL injury risk by affecting knee joint motion, the effect of trunk motion in the horizontal plane remains unclear.

"Does Restricted Ankle Joint Mobility Influence Hamstring Muscle Strength, Work and Power in Football Players after ACL Reconstruction and Non-Injured Players?",2023-10-01,2023,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Łukasz Oleksy, Anna Mika, Maciej Kuchciak, Grzegorz Bril, Renata Kielnar, Olga Adamska, Paweł Wolański, Michał Deszczyński","This study was aimed at observing how the limitation of ankle dorsiflexion ROM affects hamstring muscle Peak Torque/BW (%), Average Power (W), and Total Work (J), and whether this effect is similar in football players after ACL rupture and reconstruction and in those without injuries. The study included 47 professional football players who were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 24) after ACL reconstruction and Group 2 (n = 23) without injuries in the past 3 years. Based on the Weight-Bearing Lunge Test (WBLT), the following subgroups in Groups 1 and 2 were distinguished: N (normal ankle joint dorsiflexion) and R (restricted ankle joint dorsiflexion). The concentric isokinetic test (10 knee flexions and extensions at 60°/s) was performed on both limbs. Significantly lower values of Peak Torque/BW and Average Power were observed in Group 1 compared to Group 2, as well as in subjects with normal and restricted ankle dorsiflexion. However, no significant differences were noted for either group in any of the strength variables comparing subjects with normal and restricted ankle dorsiflexion. A poor and non-significant correlation was exhibited between the ankle joint range of dorsiflexion and all the strength variables. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for all the evaluated variables in both groups was below 0.5, or very close to this value, indicating that ankle dorsiflexion ROM has no diagnostic accuracy for hamstring muscle strength. Based on the obtained results, it can be assumed that ankle dorsiflexion limitation, which is common in football players, is not a factor in weakening hamstring muscle strength, either in football players after ACL reconstruction or among those without injuries. However, some authors have reported that limited mobility of the ankle joint can have a destructive effect on the work of the lower limbs and may also be a factor in increasing the risk of football injuries in this area. Therefore, we have suggested that hamstring muscle weakness and increased risk of injury may occur due to factors other than limited ankle mobility. These observations may be of great importance in the selection of prevention methods by including a broad spectrum of physical techniques, not just exercises that focus on the improvement of mobility or stability of the lower limbs.",1
Effects of Soccer Cleats Worn vs Lower Extremity Injuries in the English Premier League,2023-10-01,2023,SAGE Publications,Foot &amp; Ankle Orthopaedics,"Sterling DeShazo, Sabrina M. Pescatore, William M. Weiss","Category: Sports; Trauma Introduction/Purpose: As the most popular sport in the world, soccer has driven increased physical demands and higher levels of intensity, resulting in higher injury incidence amongst players. Biomechanical and epidemiological studies suggest that cleats likely play a significant role in the risk of lower extremity injuries for soccer players. The purpose of our study is to analyze cleat models and stud patterns worn by players who sustained lower extremity injuries during the English Premier League (EPL) 2021-22 season. Methods: Player injury data for 20 soccer teams was analyzed from the EPL 2021-22 season, which spanned from August 13, 2021 to May 22, 2022. The injured player cohort was established using Transfermarkt.com , a large, European-based website specializing in soccer-related news, scores, and statistics. Player injuries were separated into seven categories: ankle, calf, foot, hamstring, knee, lower leg, and thigh. Soccer cleat data was obtained from footballbootsdb.com, a publicly available, statistical database that includes information from the top European-based leagues and from major soccer tournaments such as the World Cup. Product attributes including the number of studs, stud geometry, upper material, upper thickness, upper fit, lacing mechanism, and weight were collected and confirmed using the product websites along with online third-party cleat reviews. After exclusions, a total of 221 EPL players and their respective cleats were analyzed. Results: Our results suggest that certain cleat models and stud patterns have higher associated risk of lower extremity injuries. Very aggressive stud patterns were found to have significantly more injuries when directly compared to mildly aggressive stud patterns (p=0.005). Additionally, the odds of a player sustaining an injury to their ankle (OR=1.394, p=0.042), hamstring (OR=0.892, p=0.027), or knee (OR=1.595, p=0.037) were significant with very aggressive stud patterns, while the odds of a player sustaining a hamstring injury were significant with non-aggressive stud patterns (OR=1.297, p=0.037). When considering specific cleat models, there were significantly higher odds of a player sustaining a lower extremity injury in Nike Mercurial (OR=1.256, p=0.007), Adidas X (OR=1.622, p=0.008), Nike Phantom GT (OR=0.924, p=0.018), Adidas Predator (OR=1.290, p=0.030), and Nike Tiempo (OR=0.714, p=0.048). Conclusion: In the EPL 2021-2022 season, players that wear very aggressive stud patterns may be at higher risk for lower extremity injuries, when compared to those who wear mildly aggressive stud patterns. We suggest that players, clubs, and manufacturers should evaluate their choice in footwear to best mitigate their risk of lower extremity injury.",1

Different muscle energy techniques and friction massage are commonly practiced by manual therapists to improve hamstring flexibility. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of muscle energy technique and friction massage in hamstring tightness among young athletes in Pakistan Methodology: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at Helping Hand Institute of Rehabilitation Sciences (HHIRS), Mansehra, and Neurological Orthopaedic and Sports Injury Services Mansehra (NOSIS). A total of n=60 young athletes between 18-25 years with hamstring tightness and limited straight leg raise range of motion (&lt;110⁰) were included in the study. The non-probability purposive sampling was used for data collection then the participants were randomly divided into Group A (n=20) received Post facilitation stretch (PFS), group B (n=20) received post-isometric relaxation (PIR), and Group C (n=20) which received deep friction massage through electronic massager. The athletic performance of the participants was assessed using the YMCA sit and reach test (S&amp;RT) for flexibility, agility run test (ART) for agility, vertical jump test (VJT) for explosive power, and 100-meter run test (RT) for speed and explosive power at baseline, 10th day, and 20th day of the intervention. Results: The participants had a mean age of 21.55±2.05 years. The result showed that participants who received PFS showed significant (p&lt;0.05) results as compared to PIR and FM after the 10th day, regarding VJT (p=0.006), ART (p=0.015), S&amp;RT (p&lt;0.001) and 100m RT (p&lt;0.001). After the 20th day, PFA showed better results than PIR and FM after the 10th day. The participant who received FM showed less improvement than the remaining two groups but statistically significant p&lt;0.05. Conclusion Muscle energy techniques, particularly PFS and PIR, proved effective in enhancing athletic performance parameters, including vertical jump, agility, and flexibility, among young athletes with hamstring tightness.

Relation of Jump and Change of Direction Inter-Limb Asymmetries with Fitness in Youth Male Soccer Players,2023-09-29,2023,MDPI AG,Medicina,Yiannis Michailidis,"Background and Objectives: Asymmetries between the lower limbs were evaluated by both researchers and practitioners as they seem to be related to the occurrence of injuries and the effect on performance. The purposes of this study were to (a) detect asymmetries of the lower limbs using a unilateral jump (single-leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ)) and 505 agility test, and (b) examine asymmetry effects on fitness (acceleration, speed, squat jump, Illinois agility test), in U16 youth male soccer players. Materials and Methods: Twenty U16 soccer players performed an SLCMJ and a 505 test to calculate the asymmetry index. They also performed the above fitness tests. The difference between the lower limbs was tested using the paired samples t-test (dominant vs. non-dominant). The correlations between the asymmetries of the lower extremities with the performance indicators were tested using the Pearson's correlation test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The lower limbs differed significantly in the SLCMJ and 505 tests (p < 0.05). The only correlation was between the asymmetry in SLCMJ and performance in SJ (r = -0.641, p = 0.002). Asymmetries did not affect performance on most fitness tests. Conclusions: The two asymmetry tests identified asymmetries in different limbs. This indicates the variability in asymmetries and the need for specialized tests depending on the kinematic chain. The asymmetries observed should be eliminated using individualized training programs so that athletes are protected from injuries and from the possible negative impact on performance. Also, the detection of asymmetries in developmental age offers a greater time period for their elimination before the athlete enters professional sports.",1
An Overview of Machine Learning Applications in Sports Injury Prediction,2023-09-28,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Alfred Amendolara, Devin Pfister, Marina Settelmayer, Mujtaba Shah, Veronica Wu, Sean Donnelly, Brooke Johnston, Race Peterson, David Sant, John Kriak, Kyle Bills","Use injuries, i.e., injuries caused by repetitive strain on the body, represent a serious problem in athletics that has traditionally relied on historic datasets and human experience for prevention. Existing methodologies have been frustratingly slow at developing higher precision prevention practices. Technological advancements have permitted the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) as promising toolsets to enhance both injury mitigation and rehabilitation protocols. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in ML techniques as they have been applied to sports injury prediction and prevention. A comprehensive literature review was conducted searching PubMed/Medline, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)/Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), and ScienceDirect. Ovid Discovery and Google Scholar were used to provide additional aggregate results and a grey literature search. A focus was placed on papers published from 2017 to 2022. Algorithms of interest were limited to K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), K-means, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting and AdaBoost, and neural networks. A total of 42 original research papers were included, and their results were summarized. We conclude that given the current lack of open source, uniform data sets, as well as a reliance on dated regression models, no strong conclusions about the real-world efficacy of ML as it applies to sports injury prediction can be made. However, it is suggested that addressing these two issues will allow powerful, novel ML architectures to be deployed, thus rapidly advancing the state of this field, and providing validated clinical tools.",1
Cleat-surface Interface and Lower Extremity Injuries,2023-09-28,2023,Heighten Science Publications Corporation,Journal of Sports Medicine and Therapy,"Davie Ryann, Ammerman Brittany, Pahapill Natalie, Sutton Karen","Non-contact injuries with playing surfaces occurring from applied player impact and frictional forces are a major source of lower extremity injuries in competitive sports. Artificial playing surfaces are a common alternative to natural grass surfaces; however, these surfaces are associated with player injury as well. The purpose of this manuscript is to explore the existing literature on the relationship between cleat surface interface and lower extremity injuries in athletes and the importance of proper playing surface conditions alongside proper cleat selection to optimize injury prevention and athletic performance. As artificial turf has become more advanced, studies have shown the rates of lower extremity injuries of the knee, ankle, and foot have decreased to be more similar to the rate of injury on natural grass. However, foot and ankle injury rates remain significantly higher on artificial turf. Furthermore, certain studies continue to demonstrate an increased rate of knee injuries in football players, suggesting that significant performance differences still exist between artificial turf and natural grass. Future studies warrant focusing on ways to improve the cleat-surface interface of new-generation turf, emphasizing proper cleat selection, and playing surface conditions for injury prevention thus optimizing athletic performance.",1
The effects of resistance training on jumping and selected power variables of the lower limbs in female soccer players,2023-09-27,2023,Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport,Baltic Journal of Health and Physical Activity,"Tomasz Chamera, Magdalena Pronczuk, Piotr Smok, Milosz Drozd, Malgorzata Michalczyk, Adam Maszczyk","Introduction: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a 6-week intervention of combined soccer training with resistance training on strength and power variables in highly trained female soccer players. It was hypothesized that 6 weeks is sufficient for a significant improvement in jumping ability and power to occur due to the intervention. The study involved 34 female soccer players of the top women’s league (22 ± 5 years old, body height 167 ± 5 cm, body weight 60 ± 8 kg). The players were divided into two groups of 17 participants. The control group performed 3 soccer and 1 strength training sessions (50–60% 1RM load) weekly. The experimental group performed 3 soccer and 2 resistance training sessions during a weekly micro-cycle (50–85% 1RM load). The results of the experiment indicate a significant improvement in vertical jump height and sitting leg press performance in the experimental group: CMJ (p &lt; 0.05; p = 0.000029; ES:1.00;11%), CMJA (p &lt; 0.05; p = 0.003; ES = 1.09;13%) and LP (p &lt; 0.05; p = 0.027681; ES = 0.48;6%), while in the control group changes in results after completing the training program were statistically insignificant for CMJ (p &gt; 0.05, p = 0.274000, ES:0.07,1%), CMJA (p &gt; 0.05, p = 0.350958, ES = 0.27;3%) and LP (p &gt; 0, 05; p = 0.130153; ES = 0.27;4%). The presented results suggest that a short, six-week resistance training program, specific soccer training and strength training carried out twice a week during the preparatory period may significantly improve the strength and jumping variables of the lower limbs in female soccer players.",1
The relationships between ACTN3 rs1815739 and PPARA-α rs4253778 gene polymorphisms and athletic performance characteristics in professional soccer players,2023-09-25,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Celal Bulgay, Ladislav Cepicka, Metin Dalip, Selin Yıldırım, Halil İ. Ceylan, Özlem Ö. Yılmaz, Korkut Ulucan, Georgian Badicu, Mesut Cerit","Current research on athletic performance focuses on genetic variants that contribute significantly to individuals' performance. ACTN3 rs1815739 and PPARA-α rs4253778 gene polymorphisms are variants frequently associated with athletic performance among different populations. However, there is limited research examining the pre-and post-test results of some variants of athletic performance in soccer players. Therefore, the presented research is to examine the relationships between the ACTN3 rs1815739 and PPARA-α rs4253778 gene polymorphisms and athletic performance improvement rates in adaptations to six weeks of training in elite soccer players using some athletic performance tests.Twenty-two soccer players between the ages of 18 and 35 voluntarily participated in the study. All participants were actively engaged in a rigorous six-day-a-week training program during the pre-season preparation period. Preceding and following the training program, a battery of diverse athletic performance tests was administered to the participants. Moreover, Genomic DNA was extracted from oral epithelial cells using the Invitrogen DNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, USA), following the manufacturer's protocol. Genotyping was conducted using real-time PCR. To assess the pre- and post-test performance differences of soccer players, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was employed.Upon analyzing the results of the soccer players based on the ACTN3 genotype variable, it was observed that there were no statistically significant differences in the SJ (Squat Jump), 30m sprint, CMJ (Counter Movement Jump), and DJ (Drop Jump) performance tests (p > 0.05). However, a statistically significant difference was identified in the YOYO IRT 2 (Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 2) and 1RM (One Repetition Maximum) test outcomes (YOYO IRT 2: CC, CT, and TT, p = 0.028, 0.028, 0.008, 0.000, respectively; 1RM: CC, CT, and TT, p = 0.010, 0.34, 0.001, respectively). Regarding the PPARA-α genotype variable, the statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in the SJ, 30m sprint, CMJ, and DJ performance tests (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference was observed in the YOYO IRT 2 and 1RM test results (YOYO IRT 2: CC, CG p = 0.001, 0.020; 1RM: CC, p = 0.000) CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated significant enhancements in only YOYO INT 2 and 1RM test outcomes across nearly all gene variants following the six-day-a-week training program. Other performance tests, such as the 30m sprint, SJ, CMJ, and DJ tests did not exhibit statistically significant differences. These findings contribute novel insights into the molecular processes involving PPARA-α rs4253778 and ACTN3 rs1815739 that underpin enhancements in endurance (YOYO INT 2) and maximal strength (1RM) aspects of athletic performance. However, to comprehensively elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the association between these polymorphisms and athletic performance, further investigations are warranted. It is thought that the use of field and genetic analyses together to support each other will be an important detail for athletes to reach high performance.",1

Exploring the Role of Sprint Biomechanics in Hamstring Strain Injuries: A Current Opinion on Existing Concepts and Evidence,2023-09-19,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Christopher Bramah, Jurdan Mendiguchia, Thomas Dos’Santos, Jean-Benoȋt Morin","Abstract Hamstring strain injuries are one of the most common injuries in sprint-based sports with the mechanism of injury considered the result of an interaction between applied mechanical strain and the capacity of the muscle to tolerate strain. To date, injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies have frequently focused on enhancing the capacity of the hamstrings to tolerate strain, with little consideration of factors directly influencing mechanical strain. Sprint running biomechanics are one factor proposed to influence the mechanical strain applied to the hamstrings that may be modified (towards reduced strain) within rehabilitation and injury prevention programs. This article aims to explore the theoretical mechanistic link between sprint running mechanics and hamstring strain injury, along with the available supporting evidence. In doing so, it hopes to provide practitioners with an understanding of mechanical parameters that may influence hamstring strain injury whilst also identifying areas for further research exploration.",1
Contemporary practices of physical trainers in professional soccer: A qualitative study,2023-09-19,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Psychology,"Joel Barrera-Díaz, António J. Figueiredo, Adam Field, Bruno Ferreira, Sérgio M. Querido, João Renato Silva, João Ribeiro, Ismael Pinto, Patricio Cornejo, Hernan Torres, Alvaro Saffa, Hugo Sarmento","Physical trainers (PTs) are integral for managing load, reducing injury and optimizing performance in professional soccer. However, little is known about how this practitioners operate in the applied setting and how some of the nuances experienced influence practice.This study explored the contemporary practices of PTs in professional soccer. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with eight PTs from different professional teams in European and South American leagues. Interview questions were designed to extract information on the evaluation of physical abilities, monitoring and control of training and injury prevention. Subsequently, the interviews were video-recorded, transcribed, translated and analyzed using a content analysis approach.The results suggest that the evaluation of physical capacities is carried out by PTs at the beginning of the preseason. It also appears that it is attempted that this process of regular testing is applied during the competitive period, with most participants conducting partial physiological and physical evaluations at different stages throughout the competitive season. In relation to the monitoring and control of training, subjective feedback scales are used to estimate the internal load, and the use of GPS devices is common to quantify external loads. Injury prevention programmes were implemented by all participants and were generally in a multi-component format focused on preventing or optimizing physical capabilities.These insights can be used as a scientific reference point to inform applied practice in professional soccer, especially for practitioners that are inexperienced and aspiring to enhance how they operate in the field. Future investigations should explore the practices of PTs in detail and across a wider network in order to gain deeper and comprehensive insights into the applied soccer environment.",1

For six weeks, an intervention group (IG) of 11 players participated in 25 min cutting technique modification training sessions integrated into team training twice a week, while a control group (CG) of 11 players continued their usual team training. Movement quality was assessed by evaluating 2D high-speed videos, obtained during preplanned 45° and 90° cutting tests, using the Cutting Movement Assessment Score (CMAS) qualitative screening tool. Cutting performance was assessed based on change of direction deficit (CODD). Significant interaction effects of time × group were found for CMAS in 45° and 90° cuttings (p &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.64, respectively), with large improvements in the IG (p &lt; 0.001, g = −2.16, p &lt; 0.001, g = −1.78, respectively) and deteriorations in the CG for 45° cuttings (p = 0.002, g = 1.15). However, no statistically significant differences in CODD were observed pre-to-post intervention. The cutting technique modification training was effective at improving movement quality without impairing cutting performance, and it can be used by practitioners working with adolescent athletes.",1
The Effects of Fatigue on the Lower Limb Biomechanics of Amateur Athletes during a Y-Balance Test,2023-09-16,2023,MDPI AG,Healthcare,"Congyu Huang, Jingyi Ye, Yang Song, Balint Kovács, Julien S. Baker, Zhuqing Mao, Yaodong Gu","The Y-Balance Test (YBT) is a reliable tool for assessing the dynamic balance of athletes' lower limbs. This study aimed to compare the effects of the YBT on lower limb biomechanics before and after fatigue. Sixteen adult male recreational athletes were recruited for the study, and motion capture in combination with a force plate was used to collect kinematic, dynamics, and center of pressure (COP) data of the dominant leg during YBT testing before and after fatigue. Based on the research findings, there were significant statistical differences in the distances reached during the YBT in three directions before and after fatigue. After fatigue, there is a significant decrease in the ROM of the hip and knee joints in all three directions. Also, there is a significant increase in hip joint torque in the anterior- and posterior-lateral directions, while a significant decrease in hip and ankle joint torque is observed in the posterior-medial direction. Moreover, there is an increasing trend in positive and negative joint work for the hip, knee, and ankle joints in all three directions after fatigue. The range of COP displacement also increases following fatigue. The decline in YBT scores demonstrates the detrimental impact of fatigue on the dynamic balance of the lower limbs of adult male amateur athletes. We hope that these results can provide information for athletes and coaches to better understand the effects of fatigue on the dynamic balance of lower limbs, so as to carry out targeted lower limb balance training and prevent sports injuries.",1

Soccer player positions were predicted using predictive models created with random forest (RF), gradient boosting tree, bagging classification, and regression trees algorithms, and the results were evaluated with comprehensive performance measures. Ratios and an importance plot were used to analyze the importance of the variables according to their contributions to the estimation. The findings show that the RF model achieved 100% accuracy, which means that RF can predict all player positions (100%). Running distance (26.5%), total distance (17.2%), and player load (15.8%) were the three variables that contributed the most to the estimation of the RF model and were the most important factor in distinguishing player positions. Consequently, our proposed machine learning approach (RF model) can reduce false alarms and player mispositioning.",1
Different Biomechanics in Football Shooting Using Inside and Instep Kick,2023-09-15,2023,International Journal of Disabilities Sports and Health Sciences,International Journal of Disabilities Sports and Health Sciences,Rumi Doewes,"This research purposes were examinedthe differences in shooting accuracy using inside and instep kicks and observe differences in kick movements based on biomechanical variables. Twelve professional football players shot using inside and instep kicks on circular hops targets, shooting motions were recorded using a camera at 1000 frames per second. The kinematics during the swing phase and the impact phase with the ball producing the ball’s trajectory were analyzed. Independent t-test used to compare shooting using inside and instep kick. The results showed that there was a significant difference in shooting accuracy using inside and instep kick (tcount = 3.317, p = 0.003) with a effect size large (Cohen’s d = 1.35). When observing the movements, there were significant differences in backswing knee angle (p=0.024), frontswing knee angle (p=0.034), shoulder tilt angle (p=0.045), ball bearing foot placement (p=0.019), and inclination angle of pedestal foot(p = 0.000), while other biomechanical variables showed no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05).

Hiskens, Katy M. Li, Anthony G. Schneiders, Andrew S. Fenning","Repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (rmTBI) may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases through secondary injury pathways. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) shows neuroprotection through anti-inflammatory effects and via regulation of neuronal synaptic plasticity by counteracting post-trauma excitotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms implicated in the etiology of neurodegeneration in rmTBI mice treated with ALC. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were allocated to sham, rmTBI or ALC + rmTBI groups. 15 rmTBIs were administered across 23 days using a modified weight drop model. Neurological testing and spatial learning and memory assessments via the Morris Water Maze (MWM) were undertaken at 48 h and 3 months. RT-PCR analysis of the cortex and hippocampus was undertaken for MAPT, GFAP, AIF1, GRIA, CCL11, TDP43, and TNF genes. Gene expression in the cortex showed elevated mRNA levels of MAPT, TNF, and GFAP in the rmTBI group that were reduced by ALC treatment. In the hippocampus, mRNA expression was elevated for GRIA1 in the rmTBI group but not the ALC + rmTBI treatment group. ALC treatment showed protective effects against the deficits displayed in neurological testing and MWM assessment observed in the rmTBI group. While brain structures display differential vulnerability to insult as evidenced by location specific postimpact disruption of key genes, this study shows correlative mRNA neurodegeneration and functional impairment that was ameliorated by ALC treatment in several key genes. ALC may mitigate damage inflicted in the various secondary neurodegenerative cascades and contribute to functional protection following rmTBI.",1

A Conceptual Exploration of Hamstring Muscle–Tendon Functioning during the Late-Swing Phase of Sprinting: The Importance of Evidence-Based Hamstring Training Frameworks,2023-09-05,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Judd T. Kalkhoven, Mathias Lukauskis-Carvajal, Deborah L. Sides, Blake D. McLean, Mark L. Watsford","An eccentrically lengthening, energy-absorbing, brake-driven model of hamstring function during the late-swing phase of sprinting has been widely touted within the existing literature. In contrast, an isometrically contracting, spring-driven model of hamstring function has recently been proposed. This theory has gained substantial traction within the applied sporting world, influencing understandings of hamstring function while sprinting, as well as the development and adoption of certain types of hamstring-specific exercises. Across the animal kingdom, both spring- and motor-driven muscle-tendon unit (MTU) functioning are frequently observed, with both models of locomotive functioning commonly utilising some degree of active muscle lengthening to draw upon force enhancement mechanisms. However, a method to accurately assess hamstring muscle-tendon functioning when sprinting does not exist. Accordingly, the aims of this review article are three-fold: (1) to comprehensively explore current terminology, theories and models surrounding muscle-tendon functioning during locomotion, (2) to relate these models to potential hamstring function when sprinting by examining a variety of hamstring-specific research and (3) to highlight the importance of developing and utilising evidence-based frameworks to guide hamstring training in athletes required to sprint. Due to the intensity of movement, large musculotendinous stretches and high mechanical loads experienced in the hamstrings when sprinting, it is anticipated that the hamstring MTUs adopt a model of functioning that has some reliance upon active muscle lengthening and muscle actuators during this particular task. However, each individual hamstring MTU is expected to adopt various combinations of spring-, brake- and motor-driven functioning when sprinting, in accordance with their architectural arrangement and activation patterns. Muscle function is intricate and dependent upon complex interactions between musculoskeletal kinematics and kinetics, muscle activation patterns and the neuromechanical regulation of tensions and stiffness, and loads applied by the environment, among other important variables. Accordingly, hamstring function when sprinting is anticipated to be unique to this particular activity. It is therefore proposed that the adoption of hamstring-specific exercises should not be founded on unvalidated claims of replicating hamstring function when sprinting, as has been suggested in the literature. Adaptive benefits may potentially be derived from a range of hamstring-specific exercises that vary in the stimuli they provide. Therefore, a more rigorous approach is to select hamstring-specific exercises based on thoroughly constructed evidence-based frameworks surrounding the specific stimulus provided by the exercise, the accompanying adaptations elicited by the exercise, and the effects of these adaptations on hamstring functioning and injury risk mitigation when sprinting.",1
The effects of sex hormones during the menstrual cycle on knee kinematics,2023-09-05,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Zhou Bingzheng, Zhao Xinzhuo, Jin Zhuo, Yang Xing, Li Bin, Bai Lunhao","The effects of the menstrual cycle and sex hormones on knee kinematics remain unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of the menstrual cycle and serum sex hormone concentrations on knee kinematic parameters of the 90°cutting in female college soccer athletes. Three female college soccer teams (53 subjects) participated in the study. During the first menstrual cycle, a three-step method was used to exclude subjects with anovulatory and luteal phase-deficient (LPD) (12 subjects). The subjects' menstrual cycle was divided into the menstrual phase, late-follicular phase, ovulatory phase, and mid-luteal phase (group 1, 2, 3, 4). In each phase of the second menstrual cycle, we used a portable motion analysis system to enter the teams and tested the sex hormones concentrations and knee kinematics parameters in three universities in turn. We found that subjects had a lower maximum knee valgus in group 4 compared with other groups. This meant that subjects had a lower biomechanical risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in the mid-luteal phase. There was no significant correlation between serum estrogen, progesterone concentration, and knee kinematic parameters. This meant that sex hormones did not have a protective effect. Future studies need to incorporate more factors (such as neuromuscular control, etc.) to investigate.",1

The research subjects involved as many as 60 students of the physical education, health and recreation study program STKIP Pasundan, divided into two groups (A &amp; B), group A was given stride frequency exercises, group B was given stride length exercises. From the results of data calculations in reality there is a significant influence from stride frequency training and also from stride length training to sprint running performance. But because stride length training has a greater positive impact on sprinting compared to stride frequency training, we as researchers recommend sprint trainers so that the exercise provides a greater proportion of the amount for stride length training.",1

Firstly, we discuss the biomechanical factors that contribute to ankle fractures, including loading patterns and bone density. We then explore various biomechanical assessment techniques, such as motion analysis, force measurements, and imaging modalities, which can be used to predict injury risk, guide treatment decisions, and monitor rehabilitation progress. Additionally, we examine biomechanical interventions, including bracing, taping, muscle strengthening, and proprioceptive training, which have proven effective in improving ankle stability and preventing injuries. Furthermore, we highlight the emerging technologies of wearable sensors and computational modeling, which offer new avenues for assessing ankle biomechanics and personalizing interventions. Ultimately, this paper emphasizes the integration of biomechanics with personalized medicine as a promising approach for optimizing ankle injury prevention and rehabilitation outcomes.

Thapa","Abstract Introduction. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a six-week complex contrast training (CCT) intervention on the athletic performance of highly-trained amateur male soccer players during the pre-season period. Material and Methods. Participants aged 21.3 were randomized to CCT (n = 7) or active (i.e. standard soccer training) control (CG; n = 9) groups. Athletic performance was assessed using the 30 m linear sprint test time, standing long jump distance (SLJ), countermovement jump (CMJ) height, and unilateral right-left knee flexion and extension isokinetic maximal strength tests. The experimental group replaced part of the standard soccer training schedule with three CCT sessions per week for six weeks. A two (pre-post intervention) by two (CCT, CG) mixed ANOVA was used to analyze the exercise-specific effects. In addition, between-group comparisons at post-test were conducted with baseline scores as covariate. Within group changes were analyzed using paired t-test. Results. Significant group-by-time interaction effects were found for all dependent variables (p &lt; 0.001 – 0.004). Post-hoc tests using paired t-test revealed significant improvements in all dependent variables in CCT (all p ≤ 0.001; effect size (g) = 0.29 – 0.96; %Δ = 4.5 – 14.7), but not in CG (p = 0.174 – 0.633; g = 0.03 – 0.20; %Δ = 0.4 – 2.6). Further, Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc analysis using baseline scores as a covariate showed post-test differences in favor of CCT compared to CG for all variables. Conclusions. CCT is recommended as an effective training strategy during the pre-season to improve athletic performance among highly-trained amateur male soccer players.",1
Range of motion (ROM) and Dynamic Balance Testing through Kinetic Prophylaxis Means (Applying Tissue Flossing) to Football Players,2023-09-01,2023,Asociatia LUMEN,Revista Romaneasca pentru Educatie Multidimensionala,"Dan Alexandru Szabo, Nicolae Neagu, Paula Ilyés, Cosmin Banceu, Diana Banceu, Marvin Oprean, Silvia Teodorescu","Background. An individual's ankle range of motion varies dependent on their ADLs, geographic region, and amount of physical activity. Walking, which takes 30 degrees of movement, and descending stairs, which requires 57 degrees, do not need a large ROM. Hypothesis. We hypothesised that a floss band (F.B.) placed on the ankle joint of football players of any age in conjunction with a kinetic prophylactic exercise program would enhance range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance to a higher degree than a simple kinetic prophylactic exercise program (without F.B. application). Aims. This study aims to examine the impact of a floss band on the range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance at the ankle joint, measure the ankle joint mobility and balance of football players, and maybe identify individuals susceptible to injury. Methods. The current study comprised 18 participants (mean age = 19.77 years) who were all football players from the academy and club of FK Cskszereda Miercurea Ciuc. The participants were evenly split into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. Results. Based on the data retrieved from this research, we can conclude that Floss Band treatment combined with exercise improves range of motion and dynamic balance, although not statistically significant on the majority of criteria. Conclusions. When paired with a kinetic training program, the floss band kinetic prophylactic approach significantly improves range of motion and dynamic balance, hence contributing to injury prevention.",1
Associations Between Lower-limb Muscle Volumes And Maximum Sprinting Speed In Collegiate Football Players,2023-09-01,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Herman J. Feller, Jack A. Martin, Emma A. Merrill, Brett Mortensen, Matthew K. Cousins, Olivia J. DuCharme, Stephanie A. Kliethermes, Silvia S. Blemker, David A. Opar, Bryan C. Heiderscheit","Maximum sprint speed is a key component of numerous sports and is viewed as an important predictor of athletic success. However, the relationship between lower body musculature and sprint speed remains unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between individual lower-limb muscle volumes and on-field sprint speeds in collegiate football players. METHODS: Athletes completed axial 3D T1 weighted DIXON sequence magnetic resonance scans. 16 lower limb muscles were segmented using an AI-powered process. Volumes were calculated by summing the cross-sectional areas multiplied by slice thickness and averaged across limbs. Each player completed two on-field sprints of 36-45 m (40-50 yds) while wearing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the sacrum. Sacral IMU position data was filtered (1 Hz) and differentiated with respect to time to determine speed (m/s), and peak speed was averaged across sprints. Univariable linear regression models were used to test if individual muscle volumes, normalized to body mass and height, are associated with sprint speed. The coefficient of determination (R2) and model estimate (β [(m·s-1)/(mL·kg-1·m-1)]) are reported. RESULTS: Results for 66 players (age = 22.0 ± 2.0 y (mean ± SD), mass = 104.4 ± 20.5 kg, height = 1.87 ± 0.06 m) are displayed in the table. Players ran at peak speeds of 7.39 ± 0.60 m/s. CONCLUSIONS: Several individual lower body muscle volumes can explain much of the variance in sprint speed in collegiate football players. Hip flexor and extensor volumes were most related to speed, with the psoas major volume accounting for the most variance. These findings align with previous biomechanical modeling studies. While it remains unclear whether the results presented here indicate a causal relationship, they do suggest that hip flexor and extensor strengthening could lead to greater maximum running speeds and athletic performance.

Association Of Sleep Quantity And Mood State With Countermovement Jump Performance In Male Football Athletes,2023-09-01,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Joshua A.J. Keogh, Matthew C. Ruder, Brandan Wilson, Jasriya Ahluwalia, Vishwa Kumar, Dylan Kobsar","PURPOSE: To discern the association of self-reported sleep quantity and mood state with countermovement jump (CMJ) performance in male football athletes, and to determine whether differences existed depending on starter status. METHODS: Seventy-seven male football athletes (age: 20 (2) years; height: 185 (7) cm; mass: 98 (19) kg; training experience at the collegiate level: 1.5 (1.0) years; starters: n = 21; dressers: n = 18; non-dressers: n = 38) from McMaster University participated in a 5-week longitudinal study. Participants self-reported their sleep quantity (amended from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and mood state (i.e., 0-10 Likert scale) weekly. Additionally, three maximal CMJ attempts were completed twice per week after a standardized 5-minute dynamic warm-up with a minimum of 60 seconds rest between successive attempts on two portable force plates. The variables obtained from CMJ testing included: jump height, countermovement depth, peak relative propulsive power, the modified reactive strength index, and time to takeoff, all of which were computed as weekly average values. Pearson's correlation coefficients (α = 0.05, and β = 0.20) were used to determine the association between average weekly sleep quantity and mood state, and CMJ metrics. This was computed across all athletes, as well as for each individual starter category. RESULTS: Across all athletes, sleep quantity was associated with CMJ metrics, but associations vary for starter status (Table 1). CONCLUSION: Sleep quantity was related to jump performance, but the mood state of the athlete was not. These findings support previous literature showing a relationship between sleep and jump performance, while highlighting a potential lack of sensitivity in assessments of mental health. These discrepancies may be attributed to the stigmatization surrounding mental health in athletic populations. Table 1.

Kinematic Comparison Of Clinical Assessments For Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rehabilitation,2023-09-01,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Alexis Henderson, Kristen Renner","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are well studied in the field of biomechanics and common among high school and college athletes. The single hop (SH), triple hop (TH), and stop jump (SJ) functional tests are often used by researchers and clinicians such as physical therapists to determine if an athlete is ready to return to sport. Typically, SH and TH are reported as distance traveled while SJ 3D mechanics have been widely reported. To date, the relationship between tasks is unexplored and may reveal clinically relevant information. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between joint angles during these tasks with the hypothesis that the middle TH and first landing of the SJ (SJ1) would be similar. METHODS: 20 healthy individuals completed 5-7 repetitions of SH and TH for distance and SJ. Ankle, knee, hip, trunk and pelvis sagittal plane angles and knee adduction were calculated for the SH, middle hop of the TH, SJ1 and SJ second landing (SJ2). Dunn-Sidak tests were used to detect differences between tasks (adjusted p-value<0.025). RESULTS: Joint angle means are reported in Table 1 for all tasks. All differences in joint mechanics are reported in Table 2. Dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) legs were determined by the participant kicking a soccer ball. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that the comparison between TH and SJ1 mechanics provides unique information regarding knee, hip, and pelvis mechanics. Thus, clinical populations that use SJ may benefit from analyzing the TH middle hop. There is also evidence that an increase in trunk angle is indicative of a change in direction of momentum within each task. - Joint angle means for the SH, TH, SJ landing 1 (SJ1), and SJ landing 2 (SJ2) Initial Contact Ankle Knee Knee Add.

Flexion And Extension Is Reduced Immediately Following Sport-related Concussion During The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test,2023-09-01,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Monique A. Passalacqua, Joseph McCarley, Dustin Hopfe, Madison Taylor, Kristen Quiglety, Vincentia Owusu-Amankonah, Erica Lee, Greg Ryan, John Leddy, Nora Constantino, Nicholas Murray","The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) is a premier tool to identify the degree of exercise tolerance for patients following sport-related concussions (SRC). Little to no research exists regarding any biomechanical deficits exist during post-SRC during the BCTT. PURPOSE: Examine the knee angle and physiological response among athletes between 3 days post-SRC and their symptom-free BCTT. METHODS: Two NCAA DI football players (avg. age = 20 ± 2 yr) completed the BCTT 3 days post-SRC (CON) and after being fully symptom-free (SF) for 24 hours (24 days post-SRC). The team physician diagnosed them with an SRC using the international consensus guidelines. The BCTT was performed via the standardized guidelines, which involved measurements of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS 0-10), Heart Rate (HR), and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE 6-20) during the 3.6mph consistent walking and grade increase (1%) at each minute. At CON, the test was stopped after a consecutive 2 pt change on the VAS. Each minute, the subjects' joint angles (Knee total range of motion in flexion/extension (X) and adduction/abduction (Y)) were tracked using markerless motion capture (120 Hz, Qualisys motion capture, Qualisys, Göteborg, Sweden) and analyzed using Theia (Theia Markerless, Ontario, Canada). Treating each percent incline change during the BCTT as an independent observation, paired samples t-tests (HR, Knee-X, Knee-Y) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (RPE) were run to determine differences between the CON and SF. Additionally, Spearman Rho correlations determined the relationship between VAS and tested parameters in the CON condition. RESULTS: A significant difference in HR (CON = 124 ± 26 bpm, SF = 132 ± 24 bpm; p < 0.01; ES = -1.02) response, Knee-X (CON = 67.6 ± 1.9°, SF = 70.0 ± 5.7°; p < 0.01; ES = -0.75) and RPE (CON = 11.0 ± 3.0au, SF = 6.0 ± 1.25au; p < 0.01; ES = 1.54) between the two trials. No difference was noted for Knee-Y (CON = 24.4 ± 5.7°, SF = 24.3 ± 7.1°; p = 0.97; ES = 0.01). Additionally, significant, strong, positive correlations were noted between VAS and HR (r = 0.73, p < 0.01) and RPE (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). No significant relationships existed between VAS and either Knee-X (r = 0.27, p = 0.16) or Knee-Y (r = 0.37, p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a reduction (4.8%) in Knee flexion/extension alongside changes in physiological markers post-SRC.",1
Hip Strength Changes Over The Course Of 1 Year Between Male And Female Collegiate Soccer Athletes,2023-09-01,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"Emma Schossler, Jeffrey B. Taylor, Kevin R. Ford, Christopher J. Johnston, Brett S. Pexa","Hip strength is related to movement quality, lower extremity biomechanics, and injury risk, but there is minimal evidence about how these measures change year-over-year in competitive collegiate student-athletes. PURPOSE: To determine how hip strength changes between 2 preseasons in male and female collegiate soccer athletes. METHODS: Thirty collegiate soccer athletes (13 M, 17F, age = 20.8 ± 1.4 years, height = 173.5 ± 8.5, mass = 71.4 ± 8.72 kg) were tested in the preseason of 2021 and 2022 for hip abduction and adduction peak strength. Isometric hip strength was collected in a supine position with the knees bent to 90 degrees and hips flexed to 45 degrees. Three trials of hip abduction and hip adduction were performed on the right and left legs. Forces were standardized to body weight of the individuals, and the average force per bodyweight (%BW) of the trials was used for the analysis. Linear mixed models were used to compare hip strength across year (2021 and 2022), sex (male and female), and the interaction between them. Limb was included as a covariate, and participant ID was used as a random intercept. Post-hoc testing was performed with t-tests. Analysis was significant when p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant interaction for either hip abduction or hip adduction (p > 0.05). For hip abduction, there was a significant effect of year (F = 13.9, p < 0.001), and team (F = 5.45, p = 0.02). Post-hoc testing showed a 7.2%BW difference between males and females (p = 0.02) and 3.1%BW increase in strength between years (p < 0.001). For hip adduction, there was a main effect of year (F = 4.70, p = 0.03), with post-hoc testing revealing a 2.4%BW increase in strength between years (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Males demonstrate higher hip abduction strength, and both hip abduction and adduction strength increase over the course of a year. Since hip strength is critical for injury prevention, these measures could be used to determine who may be at risk for lower extremity injury. Future research should identify the magnitude of strength gains year-over-year to determine benchmarks for normal strength development.",1
Achilles Tendinopathy Pathogenesis and Management: A Narrative Review,2023-08-30,2023,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Domiziano Tarantino, Rosita Mottola, Giuseppina Resta, Rossana Gnasso, Stefano Palermi, Bruno Corrado, Felice Sirico, Carlo Ruosi, Rocco Aicale","The Achilles tendon is the thickest and strongest tendon of the human body, and it is frequently injured during sports activity. The incidence of Achilles tendon pathologies has increased over recent decades, especially in the last few years, because of increased sports participation among the general population and due to the diffusion of competitive sports at a high level. Tendinopathies are common in athletes and in middle-aged overweight patients. The term ""tendinopathy"" refers to a condition characterised clinically by pain and swelling, with functional limitations of tendon and nearby structures, and consequently to chronic failure of healing response process. Tendinopathies can produce marked morbidity, and at present, scientifically validated management modalities are limited. Despite the constantly increasing interest and number of studies about Achilles tendinopathy (AT), there is still not a consensual point of view on which is the best treatment, and its management is still controversial. AT can be treated conservatively primarily, with acceptable results and clinical outcomes. When this approach fails, surgery should be considered. Several surgical procedures have been described for both conditions with a relatively high rate of success with few complications and the decision for treatment in patients with AT should be tailored on patient's needs and level of activity. The aim of this article is to give insights about the pathogenesis and most used and recent treatment options for AT.",1

Epidemiology of Injuries in Men’s Professional and Amateur Football (Part I),2023-08-26,2023,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Tudor Vladimir Gurau, Gabriela Gurau, Doina Carina Voinescu, Lucretia Anghel, Gelu Onose, Daniel Andrei Iordan, Constantin Munteanu, Ilie Onu, Carmina Liana Musat","Background (1): Football is the most popular sport among men, associated with a certain risk of injury, which leads to short- and long-term health consequences. While the injury profile of professional footballers is known, little is known about the injury profile of amateur footballers; amateur football is a major and diverse area, the development of which should be a priority for football associations around the world and UEFA. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of epidemiological literature data on injuries in professional and amateur football players belonging to certain leagues. Methods (2): A systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed until June 2023 in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Google Academic, Google Scholar, and Diva portal. Forty-six studies reporting injury incidence in professional and amateur men's football were selected and analyzed. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using an adapted version of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess risk of bias for the quality of external validity. Results (3): The overall incidence of injuries in professional male football players was 7.75 ± 2.28, 95% confidence interval, injuries/1000 h of exposure and that of amateur football players was 7.98 ± 2.95, 95% confidence interval, injuries/1000 h of exposure. The incidence of match injuries (30.64 ± 10.28, 95% confidence interval, injuries/1000 exposure hours) was 7.71 times higher than the training injury incidence rate (3.97 ± 1.35, 95% confidence interval, injuries/1000 h) in professional football players and 5.45 times higher in amateurs (17.56 ± 6.15 vs. 3.22 ± 1.4, 95% confidence interval, injuries/1000 h). Aggregate lower extremity injuries had the highest prevalence in both categories of footballers, being 83.32 ± 4.85% in professional footballers and 80.4 ± 7.04% in amateur footballers: thigh, ankle, and knee injuries predominated. Conclusions (4): Professional and amateur football players are at substantial risk of injury, especially during matches that require the highest level of performance. Injury rates have implications for players, coaches, and sports medicine practitioners. Therefore, information on football injuries can help develop personalized injury risk mitigation strategies that could make football safer for both categories of football players. The current findings have implications for the management, monitoring, and design of training, competition, injury prevention, especially severe injury, and education programs for amateur football players.",1
Short-term outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with or without lateral tenodesis or anterolateral ligament reconstruction: a retrospective cohort,2023-08-26,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,International Orthopaedics,"Ashraf T.

Ahmed, Theodorakys Marin Fermin, Luca Macchiarola, Vasileios Sideris, Emmanouil Papakostas, Pieter D’ Hooghe, Khalid Al-Khelaifi, Bruno Olory, Bashir Zikria","This study aimed to compare the short-term outcomes of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) alone, ACLR with lateral tenodesis, and ACL and ALL reconstruction.A retrospective cohort of prospectively collected data on all ACL procedures was performed at Aspetar Specialized Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital between January 2020 and January 2021. Patients were treated with ACLR alone, ACLR with lateral tenodesis, or ACLR with ALL reconstruction. The primary outcome was the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (sIKDC) score. The secondary outcomes were the ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scores, pivot shift grade, subjective knee stability, and subjective pain on activity.A total of 100 cases were included. The most common technique was ACLR with lateral tenodesis (42%), followed by ACLR alone (38%) and ACL with ALL reconstruction (20%). The mean age was 28.15 years (15-60), and 94% of the patients were males. Meniscal procedures were more frequent in the ACLR alone group (65.8%). There was no association between subjective stability, sIKDC, ACL-RSI, and pivot shift grade and the three ACLR techniques while adjusting for age, sex, and concomitant meniscus procedures at six weeks, 12 weeks, six months, and nine months. However, there was a significant decrease in postoperative flexion in the ACL and ALL reconstruction group by a mean of 22° (95% CI - 40.7 - 3.4; P = 0.02) at 6 weeks compared to ACLR alone, which was not evident on later follow-ups.ACLR with/without lateral augmentation procedures yields similar subjective IKDC, ACL-RSI, pivot shift grade, and subjective knee instability at short-term follow-up. Therefore, lateral extra-articular augmentation procedures are safe to be performed.",1
Neuromuscular Characteristics of Unilateral and Bilateral Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contractions following ACL Reconstruction,2023-08-26,2023,MDPI AG,Biology,"Riccardo Di Giminiani, Stefano Marinelli, Stefano La Greca, Andrea Di Blasio, Massimo Angelozzi, Angelo Cacchio","Despite the advancement of diagnostic surgical techniques in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and rehabilitation protocols following ACL injury, only half of the athletes return to sports at a competitive level. A major concern is neuromechanical dysfunction, which occurs with injuries persisting in operated and non-operated legs following ACL rehabilitation. One of the criteria for a safe return to sports participation is based on the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) performed unilaterally and a comparison between the 'healthy knee' and the 'operated knee'. The present study aimed to investigate MVIC in athletes following ACL rehabilitation during open kinetic chain exercise performed unilaterally and bilateral exercises. Twenty subjects participated in the present investigation: 10 male athletes of regional-national level (skiers, rugby, soccer, and volleyball players) who were previously operated on one knee and received a complete rehabilitation protocol (for 6-9 months) were included in the ACL group (age: 23.4 ± 2.11 years; stature: 182.0 ± 9.9 cm; body mass: 78.6 ± 9.9 kg; body mass index: 23.7 ± 1.9 kg/m2), and 10 healthy male athletes formed the control group (CG: age: 24.0 ± 3.4 years; stature: 180.3 ± 10.7 cm; body mass: 74.9 ± 13.5 kg; body mass index: 22.8 ± 2.7 kg/m2). MVICs synchronised with electromyographic (EMG) activity (recorded on the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and biceps femoris muscles) were performed during unilateral and bilateral exertions. The rate of force development (RFD) and co-activation index (CI) were also calculated. The differences in the MVIC and RFD between the two legs within each group were not significant (p > 0.05). Vastus lateralis EMG activity during MVIC and biceps femoris EMG activity during RFD were significantly higher in the operated leg than those in the non-operated leg when exertion was performed bilaterally (p < 0.05). The CI was higher in the operated leg than that in the non-operated leg when exertion was performed bilaterally (p < 0.05). Vice versa, vastus medialis EMG activity during RFD was significantly higher in the right leg than that in the left leg when exertion was performed bilaterally (p < 0.05) in the CG. MVICs performed bilaterally represent a reliability modality for highlighting neuromechanical asymmetries. This bilateral exercise should be included in the criteria for a safe return to sports following ACL reconstruction.",1

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between physical demands, skin temperature, and well-being status in 30 elite football players over a 12-week competitive period. Thermography assessments, weekly Well-being questionnaires, and daily training and match load recordings were used to gather data. Results indicated that along the microcycles there was a decrease in high-intensity accelerations and decelerations distance completed, while maintaining other high-intensity actions. Furthermore, it was found that high-intensity movements contribute to the generation of thermal asymmetries in the thighs; the adductor thermal asymmetry showed a positive relationship with stress and muscle soreness, the knee thermal asymmetry had a positive relationship with fatigue and a negative relationship with rest and quality of rest, and finally the hamstrings muscles exhibited significant differences between the thermal asymmetry groups, with the high asymmetry completing less high intensity actions than the low asymmetry group. In conclusion, this study highlights the interconnections between physical demands, skin temperature, and well-being in elite football players and provides valuable insights for coaches and trainers in their efforts to optimize performance and health.",1
Cartilage injury patterns in the professional athlete,2023-08-18,2023,Elsevier BV,Journal of Cartilage &amp; Joint Preservation,"Mobeen Farooq, Christine Dan-Lantsman, Jeffrey A. Belair","<h2>Abstract</h2> In this article, the authors review various types of cartilage injury patterns observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in professional athletes. Several examples of commonly injured joints are presented to showcase the importance of MRI in both the initial detection and characterization of cartilage lesions and the ensuing postoperative success of repair and/or restoration procedures in this unique patient population. Obtaining high-quality MRI studies, thoroughly understanding articular cartilage anatomy and pathology, and familiarizing oneself with the typical mechanisms of injury in various sports are of paramount importance to both radiologists and sports medicine clinicians alike. The authors aim to provide the reader with the foundational tools for approaching articular cartilage injuries in elite athletes and adding value to the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.",1
Comparison of external load measures per minute based on match seasonal periods and playing positions of a soccer Turkish super league team,2023-08-17,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Zeki Akyildiz, Yılmaz Yüksel, Yaşar Birgonül, Halil İbrahim Ceylan, Rafael Oliveira, Erhan Çene, Coskun Parim, Filipe Manuel Clemente, Hadi Nobari","Turkish Super League teams need more information about the external load. Considering the specific country and the coaches' philosophies, the purpose of this study was to compare the external match load of a Turkish Super League team considering the different playing positions and in-season periods.A longitudinal study design was employed by observing 29 official matches of the same team. A total of fifteen players, consisting of five defenders, five midfielders, and five forwards, were analyzed using the Sentio Sports Optical Tracking System. The following outcomes were extracted in each match: total distance (TD), walking [from 0 to 7.2 km/h], jogging [from 7.2 to 14.4 km/h], running [from 14.4 to 20 km/h], high speed running (HSR) [> 20 km/h], metabolic power (MP), maximum deceleration (Decmax) [Dec < -3 m/s2], total deceleration distance (Dectotal), maximum acceleration (Accmax) [Acc > 3 m/s2], and total acceleration distance (Acctotal). Statistical analysis consisted of ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc tests.The main results showed that all variables were similar between periods of the season (p > 0.05) except for walking (p = 0.021 witha large effect size), which revealed lower values in the mid-season period. When analyzing periods of the season considering playing positions, there were several significant results for TD, walking, jogging, running, HSR, Dectotal and Acctotal (p < 0.05, with small to large effects). A tendency for higher values was noted in the mid and end-season. Considering the playing positions comparisons, midfielders showed higher values than defenders for TD, MP, Dectotal and Acctotal (p < 0.05 with large effect for all). Midfielders also showed higher values than forwards for TD, jogging, Dectotal and Acctotal (p < 0.05 with a large effect for all).The present study emphasizes the significance of analyzing data based on minute, playing position, and season period. Findings reveal that defenders consistently displayed the lowest values in all external load measures during matches compared to other positions throughout the season. Furthermore, midfielders demonstrated a higher activity profile during the initial and middle stages of the season compared to other positions, with a slight tendency to decrease load towards the end of the season.",1
Intramuscular Tendon Injuries of the Hamstring Muscles: A More Severe Variant? A Narrative Review,2023-08-14,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Fearghal Kerin, Stuart O’Flanagan, Joe Coyle, Garreth Farrell, Darragh Curley, Ulrik McCarthy Persson, Giuseppe De Vito, Eamonn Delahunt","Hamstring strain injuries (HSI) are one of the most common sport-related injuries. They have a high injury burden and a high recurrence rate. The development of novel muscle injury grading systems has provided new insights into the possible impact of injury location on the time to return to play (TTRTP) and re-injury following HSI. In particular, injuries to the intramuscular tendon (IMT) may be present in up to 41% of all HSI and have been described as a 'serious thigh muscle strain'. Re-injury rates as high as 60% have been described in elite track and field athletes, as well as prolonged TTRTP. A systematic search was carried out using appropriate keywords to identify articles reporting on HSI involving the IMT in athletes. The primary aim was to determine whether IMT injuries warrant being classified as a distinct clinical entity with different expected outcomes to other hamstring muscle injuries. This narrative review summarises the existing evidence on: (1) the anatomy of the IMT and its response to injury; (2) the role of MRI and novel grading scales in IMT injury management (3) clinical assessment of IMT injuries, (4) TTRTP and re-injury rates across sports following IMT, (5) conservative rehabilitation and the role of specific 'IMT-oriented' strategies, and (6) indications for and approaches to surgery. The review found that important clinical outcomes such as re-injury rates and TTRTP vary across populations, cohorts and sports which suggest that outcomes are specific to the sporting context. Bespoke rehabilitation, tailored to IMT injury, has been shown to significantly reduce re-injuries in elite track and field athletes, without compromising TTRTP. Continued prospective studies across other sports and cohorts, are warranted to further establish relevant clinical findings, indications for surgical intervention and outcomes across other sporting cohorts.",1

It explains the dynamic interaction between mechanical trauma and the neuroinflammatory response, especially the crucial role of microglia in post-TBI inflammation. Moreover, the review discusses the significance of dendritic and spinal changes as indicators of a regenerative response. The role of transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 and tau protein in the pathogenesis of mild TBI and CTE is assessed, with tau protein changes being a potential biomarker for acute and chronic TBI-related conditions. The study also investigates syndromes commonly found in young athletes, such as second impact syndrome and juvenile head trauma syndrome. The review addresses the complex inflammatory response after mild TBI, focusing on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP as potential indicators of injury severity and outcome. The review calls for further research to elucidate the exact relationship of these factors in TBI and its long-term effects.",1
Case Report: Indirect Traumatic Optic Neuropathy from Subconcussive Soccer Headers in a 62-year-old Athlete,2023-08-12,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Optometry and Vision Science,"Radha P. Pandya, Shruti Pandya, Kelly H. Thomann","SIGNIFICANCE Traumatic optic neuropathy is an uncommon but devastating cause of vision loss after injury to the head. Soccer players may have a heightened risk because of the game's emphasis on heading the ball, a technique in which a player hits the soccer ball with his/her head. PURPOSE This article reviews the case of an avid soccer player with traumatic optic neuropathy that occurred after numerous soccer ball headings during a game. This article also (1) provides a summary of the pathophysiology and epidemiology of traumatic optic neuropathy, (2) reviews the current literature on head and eye injuries in soccer, and (3) discusses biomechanical differences in orbital structure throughout aging, which may predispose older patients to traumatic optic neuropathy. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 62-year-old male patient who reported to the clinic, after repeated subconcussive soccer ball headers the previous day, with symptoms of blurred vision and “seeing stars” in the right eye and a right inferior visual field impairment. Physical examination, subsequent laboratory work, and neurologic consults implicated traumatic optic neuropathy as the primary diagnosis, and halting soccer playing resulted in symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS Although not commonly encountered in soccer players, the potential for traumatic optic neuropathy exists. Older athletes may be predisposed because of morphological changes of the orbit. Future direction may look to further investigate hazards promoting traumatic optic neuropathy in older athletes and determine possible protections against injury.",1
Commercially available pressure sensors for sport and health applications: A comparative review,2023-08-11,2023,Elsevier BV,The Foot,"Louise Burnie, Nachiappan Chockalingam, Alex Holder, Tim Claypole, Liam Kilduff, Neil Bezodis","Pressure measurement systems have numerous applications in healthcare and sport. The purpose of this review is to: (a) describe the brief history of the development of pressure sensors for clinical and sport applications, (b) discuss the design requirements for pressure measurement systems for different applications, (c) critique the suitability, reliability, and validity of commercial pressure measurement systems, and (d) suggest future directions for the development of pressure measurements systems in this area. Commercial pressure measurement systems generally use capacitive or resistive sensors, and typically capacitive sensors have been reported to be more valid and reliable than resistive sensors for prolonged use. It is important to acknowledge, however, that the selection of sensors is contingent upon the specific application requirements. Recent improvements in sensor and wireless technology and computational power have resulted in systems that have higher sensor density and sampling frequency with improved usability – thinner, lighter platforms, some of which are wireless, and reduced the obtrusiveness of in-shoe systems due to wireless data transmission and smaller data-logger and control units. Future developments of pressure sensors should focus on the design of systems that can measure or accurately predict shear stresses in conjunction with pressure, as it is thought the combination of both contributes to the development of pressure ulcers and diabetic plantar ulcers. The focus for the development of in-shoe pressure measurement systems is to minimise any potential interference to the patient or athlete, and to reduce power consumption of the wireless systems to improve the battery life, so these systems can be used to monitor daily activity. A potential solution to reduce the obtrusiveness of in-shoe systems include thin flexible pressure sensors which can be incorporated into socks. Although some experimental systems are available further work is needed to improve their validity and reliability.",1
An Instrumented Mouthguard for Real-Time Measurement of Head Kinematics under a Large Range of Sport Specific Accelerations,2023-08-10,2023,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Chris M. Jones, Kieran Austin, Simon N. Augustus, Kieran Jai Nicholas, Xiancheng Yu, Claire Baker, Emily Yik Kwan Chan, Mike Loosemore, Mazdak Ghajari","Head impacts in sports can produce brain injuries. The accurate quantification of head kinematics through instrumented mouthguards (iMG) can help identify underlying brain motion during injurious impacts. The aim of the current study is to assess the validity of an iMG across a large range of linear and rotational accelerations to allow for on-field head impact monitoring.Drop tests of an instrumented helmeted anthropometric testing device (ATD) were performed across a range of impact magnitudes and locations, with iMG measures collected concurrently. ATD and iMG kinematics were also fed forward to high-fidelity brain models to predict maximal principal strain.The impacts produced a wide range of head kinematics (16-171 g, 1330-10,164 rad/s2 and 11.3-41.5 rad/s) and durations (6-18 ms), representing impacts in rugby and boxing. Comparison of the peak values across ATD and iMG indicated high levels of agreement, with a total concordance correlation coefficient of 0.97 for peak impact kinematics and 0.97 for predicted brain strain. We also found good agreement between iMG and ATD measured time-series kinematic data, with the highest normalized root mean squared error for rotational velocity (5.47 ± 2.61%) and the lowest for rotational acceleration (1.24 ± 0.86%). Our results confirm that the iMG can reliably measure laboratory-based head kinematics under a large range of accelerations and is suitable for future on-field validity assessments.",1

The foot morphology was evaluated in 4 parameters. Balance scores were evaluated in 8 parameters. Spearman and Pearson correlation tests were used to determine the relationship between parameters (p&amp;lt;05). According to the results, it was observed that in the right foot there was a negative significant correlation between foot index (FI) parameter and standard deviation of forward and backward sway (FBSD), average forward backward speed (AFBS), used perimeter (P), used area (A) balance scores. In the left foot, there was a positive correlation between the FI parameter and the pressure to the average central y axis (COPY) balance score, and a negative significant relationship between the FI parameter and the FBSD and AFBS balance scores. It was determined that there was a positive significant correlation between the Chippaux Smirak index (CSI) and Staheli index (SI) parameters of both feet and the pressure to the average central x point (COPX) balance score. The results can be interpreted that the anatomical structure of the foot is important in the static balance characteristics of athletes.",1

Greater Core Endurance Identifies Improved Mechanics During Jump Landing in Female Youth Soccer Athletes,2023-08-04,2023,Human Kinetics,Women in Sport and Physical Activity Journal,"Kate Pfile, Michelle Boling, Andrea Baellow, Emma Zuk, Anh-Dung Nguyen","Female soccer athletes are at greater risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury compared with males. Risk factors include altered landing biomechanics and diminished core neuromuscular control, measured using advanced laboratory equipment. There is a need for a clinical measure of core muscle function to better understand kinesiological factors within a female, youth athlete population. The purpose was to determine whether sagittal and frontal plane kinematics during a jump landing task differ based on levels of core endurance in female youth soccer athletes. Participants included healthy, female soccer athletes ages 8–17 years ( M = 12.3 years, SD = 2.4 years), height ( M = 1.52 m, SD = 0.16 m), and body mass ( M = 46.0 kg, SD = 13.7 kg). A quantitative data descriptive laboratory study in a field-based setting was conducted. Sixty-six participants performed the side plank test for time to failure. Three-dimensional biomechanics were collected, and initial contact and peak trunk, hip, and knee joint angles were identified during the deceleration phase of a double-leg jump-landing task. The group with the lowest side plank time displayed decreased knee flexion at initial contact ( p = .02) and peak knee flexion ( p = .03) and decreased peak hip flexion angles ( p = .01). There were no additional statistically significant differences among groups ( p &gt; .05). Female youth soccer athletes who have reduced core endurance also display decreased hip and knee flexion, which may place them at risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury.",1
"Sports-Related Concussion Assessment: A New Physiological, Biomechanical, and Cognitive Methodology Incorporating a Randomized Controlled Trial Study Protocol",2023-08-04,2023,MDPI AG,Biology,"Gareth Irwin, Matthew J. Rogatzki, Huw D. Wiltshire, Genevieve K. R. Williams, Yaodong Gu, Garrett I. Ash, Dan Tao, Julien S. Baker","Background: Taking part in moderate-to-vigorous exercise in contact sports on a regular basis may be linked to an increase in cerebrovascular injury and head trauma. Validated objective measures are lacking in the initial post-event diagnosis of head injury. The exercise style, duration, and intensity may also confound diagnostic indicators. As a result, we propose that the new Interdisciplinary Group in Movement &amp; Performance from Acute &amp; Chronic Head Trauma (IMPACT) analyze a variety of functional (biomechanical and motor control) tests as well as related biochemistry to see how they are affected by contact in sports and head injury. The study’s goal will be to look into the performance and physiological changes in rugby players after a game for head trauma and injury. Methods: This one-of-a-kind study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) utilizing a sport participation group and a non-participation control group. Forty male rugby 7 s players will be recruited for the study and allocated randomly to the experimental groups. The intervention group will participate in three straight rugby matches during a local 7 s rugby event. At the pre-match baseline, demographic and anthropometric data will be collected. This will be followed by the pre-match baseline collection of biochemical, biomechanical, and cognitive-motor task data. After three consecutive matches, the same measures will be taken. During each match, a notational analysis will be undertaken to obtain contact information. All measurements will be taken again 24, 48, and 72 h after the third match. Discussion: When the number of games increases owing to weariness and/or stressful circumstances, we expect a decline in body movement, coordination, and cognitive-motor tasks. Changes in blood biochemistry are expected to correspond to changes in biomechanics and cognitive-motor processes. This research proposal will generate considerable, ecologically valid data on the occurrence of head trauma events under game conditions, as well as the influence of these events on the biological systems of the performers. This will lead to a greater understanding of how sports participants react to exercise-induced injuries. This study’s scope will have far-reaching ramifications for doctors, coaches, managers, scientists, and sports regulatory bodies concerned with the health and well-being of athletic populations at all levels of competition, including all genders and ages.",1

Purpose: To evaluate the role of meniscal repair in the performance of semiprofessional soccer players who returned to sport after ACLR. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study included 51 male soccer players (mean ± SD age, 28.82 ± 5.33 years) who underwent ACLR at a single institution between July 2018 and July 2019. The players were divided into 3 groups according to surgery type: ACLR only (n = 30), ACLR with lateral meniscal repair (n = 9), and ACLR with medial meniscal repair (n = 12). Outcomes were evaluated through clinical examination, self-reported health questionnaires (Cincinnati Knee Rating System, Tegner activity score, Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and ACL–Return to Sport After Injury), and biomechanical performance evaluations (balance, strength, coordination, and symmetry tests). Parametric and nonparametric tests were carried out for multiple comparisons. Results: The mean ± SD follow-up time was 20.75 ± 9.38 months. Although no significant differences emerged in clinical and self-reported health status, almost all the physical parameters tested resulted in lower performance in players treated with ACLR and meniscal repair. Moreover, patients with ACLR with lateral meniscal repair reported higher pain and fear of reinjury, with lower outcomes in terms of strength, symmetry, and coordination as compared with the other 2 groups. Balance abilities were significantly affected in players who underwent meniscal repair as compared with those who underwent ACLR only. Conclusion: The findings showed that biomechanical performance measures and fear of reinjury were significantly worse in soccer players with associated meniscal repair at a minimum 1-year follow-up, especially in those with a lateral meniscal tear.",1

However, comparative assessments of LBP prevalence and severity across various sports remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with LBP in 388 professional athletes, including football, ice hockey, and floorball players. MATERIAL AND METHODS Conducted from June 2021 to September 2022, this cross-sectional study incorporated 388 athletes from national elite clubs, including football (n=148), ice hockey (n=179), and floorball (n=61). The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), comprising sections like pain intensity, self-care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sexual life, social life, and traveling, was employed to evaluate spinal pain and disability. RESULTS The study found no significant disparities in the LBP assessment among the groups. The relative risk (OR) of LBP and disability varied among the sports: football players displayed a lower risk (OR=0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.74, P≤0.001), while ice hockey players had a higher risk (OR=2.18; 95% CI 1.45-3.29, P≤0.001) compared to the others. In contrast, the risk for floorball players (OR=0.82; 95% CI 0.47-1.41) did not significantly deviate from that of the other two sports. CONCLUSIONS LBP prevalence stood at 42.6% for football players, 60.1% for ice hockey players, and 49.2% for floorball players. Among these, ice hockey players exhibited a 2.18-fold increased risk of developing LBP and associated disability when compared to their football and floorball counterparts.",1

Assessing the effect of prophylactic ankle taping on ankle and knee biomechanics during landing tasks in healthy individuals: A cross-sectional observational study,2023-07-31,2023,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Sao Paulo Medical Journal,"Carlos Romero-Morales, Ana Matilde-Cruz, María García-Arrabe, Felix Higes-Núñez, Alexandre Días Lópes, Sergio Jiménez Saiz, Helios Pareja-Galeano, Daniel López-López","Current research supports the fact that prophylactic ankle taping (AT) is effective in preventing ankle injuries in amateur and elite sports athletes.This study aimed to investigate the effect of AT on balance, knee valgus during drop jump and single-leg countermovement jump (SL-CMJ) landings, and ankle range of motion (ROM) restriction in healthy participants.A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Universidad Europea de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.Participants: Thirty-nine healthy individuals participated in this study and performed the movements under two conditions (with and without tape). Outcome measurements: ankle ROM, balance, SL-CMJ height, flight time, ground time, and knee valgus. Before any intervention, a random process was developed with a 1:1 allocation ratio, and the participants were assigned to groups A (tape-no tape) and B (no tape-tape).Significant differences between tape and no-tape moments were observed for drop jump knee valgus flexion (P = 0.007), with an increase in knee valgus in participants with ankle taping. Similarly, the Y-balance testshowed a significant decrease in all variables (P = 0.001 and), ankle dorsiflexion (P = 0.001) in participants with ankle taping.AT is effective for immediate ankle ROM restriction. However, an increase in knee valgus during drop jump task and a decrease in lower limb balance were observed during drop jump task. Based on these results, it can be concluded that AT application in healthy individuals should not be recommended as it results in increase in injury risk factors.",1
Altered Joint Angle Strategy for Sprinting in Elite Sprinters with Chronic Ankle Instability,2023-07-31,2023,Korean Academy of Kinesiology,The Asian Journal of Kinesiology,"Hiroki Arakawa, Masamichi Okudaira, Satoru Tanigawa, Hirohiko Maemura, Takashi Fukuda","OBJECTIVES Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) demonstrated altered not only ankle but also lower extremity joint angle during numerous dynamic movements compared to healthy controls. However, little is known about joint angles during sprinting, which is the most essential movement during explosive sports. We, therefore, investigated the lower extremity joint angle during sprinting between elite sprinters with CAI and healthy controls.METHODS Fourteen male college sprinters participated in this study, seven with CAI and seven healthy controls. Five-second steady speed running was performed on a treadmill at 7.5 m/s. Mean lower extremity joint angles were compared applying the statistical parametric mapping method.RESULTS The CAI patients demonstrated significantly higher ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion angles during the stance phase. Additionally, large between-group effect sizes would demonstrate higher ankle dorsiflexion and knee and hip flexion angle from the late swing phase to the late stance phase.CONCLUSIONS The altered lower extremity joint angles from the late swing phase to the late stance phase in CAI patients suggest greater joint stability for large external loads with feed-forward motor control programs.",1
Effectiveness of Exercises Plyometrics in the Treatment of Post-Muscle-Tendon Injuries in Under-17 Category Footballers,2023-07-28,2023,Dewspublication,Migration Letters,"Sonia Alexandra Alvarez Carrión, María Belén Pérez García","Musculotendon injuries, which encompass a variety of conditions from muscle strains to tendinitis, are a common concern in athletes of all ages and levels. These injuries, considered overuse pathologies, constitute a significant part of sports injuries and are often related to constant repetition of loads on the tendons. In this context, plyometrics, a training approach focused on jumping and explosive exercises, has emerged as a promising tool in the rehabilitation of these injuries. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of plyometrics exercises in the treatment of musculotendon injuries in under-17 soccer players. In this descriptive study, the prevalence of muscle-tendon injuries in under-17 football players was investigated. It was evident that several previous studies in the sports field have addressed the importance of muscle functionality for athletic performance and quality of life in general this through plyometrics. While plyometrics are commonly used in sports that require jumping, rapid changes of direction, and explosive movements, its effectiveness in the rehabilitation of musculotendon injuries still requires deeper and more precise evaluation. Athletes' perception and satisfaction with these exercises may influence their adherence to the rehabilitation program and, therefore, their success in recovery.",1
Materials and Manufacturing for Ankle–Foot Orthoses: A Review,2023-07-26,2023,Wiley,Advanced Engineering Materials,"Alireza Nouri, Lijing Wang, Yuncang Li, Cuie Wen","Ankle–foot orthoses (AFOs) assist patients with gait impairment by correcting ankle and foot deformities, restoring mobility, reducing pain, and providing protection and immobilization. AFOs can effectively manage various types of gait pathologies, including foot drop, crouch gait, equinus gait, and stiff knee gait. AFOs are available in prefabricated or custom‐made forms in various designs. The selection criteria for the fabrication of an AFO are the duration of usage, the amount of applied force, the degree of axial loading, the patient's skin condition, and the cost. The accessibility of diverse materials in the last century has significantly improved orthoses. Ideal orthotic materials must be light, stiff, and strong, and can be made of plastics, metals, polymer‐based composites, leather, or a hybrid of different materials. A deeper understanding of the materials employed in the fabrication of AFOs holds the potential for more advanced and efficient orthoses, which can improve patients’ ability to ambulate in the real world. The present review provides insight into the various materials utilized for the fabrication of AFOs and describes the benefits and challenges associated with the materials. An attempt has also been made to highlight typical gait pathologies and design concepts in response to them.",1

González-Fernández, MD, Wanesa Onetti-Onetti","This study analyzed the effects of psychological responses (impulsivity, self-esteem, self-confidence, and anxiety) in baseline and pre-competitive contexts of national soccer referees (SRs), their control of the game (yellow and red cards), and physical performance (PP) according to the role (assistant or main referee), and experience in the category. Twenty-seven national SRs from Spain participated in this study. Baseline and pre-competitive psychological data were collected through the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2 test), Urgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P test), and Rosenberg tests. Furthermore, WIMU PRO™ inertial devices were used to monitor PP. The results indicated that a lack of perseverance and self-esteem were higher in the main SRs and somatic anxiety in assistant SRs. Experience of SRs was related to anxiety, self-confidence, self-esteem, impulsivity dimensions, and PP metrics (p < 0.05). Finally, red cards were related to positive and negative urgency (r = 0.38 and r = 0.35, p < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, the main SRs and SRs with more experience had better psychological characteristics and PP in a competitive context. However, yellow and red cards were not associated with these factors, although red cards were related with urgency. Based on these data, specific training programs could be incorporated to enhance emotional control in SRs with less experience to achieve greater performance and professional development.",1
The Impact of Psychological Factors on Return to Sports after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review,2023-07-24,2023,MDPI AG,Osteology,"Umile Giuseppe Longo, Sergio De Salvatore, Federica D’Orrico, Matilda Bella, Alessandra Corradini, Giacomo Rizzello, Maria Grazia De Marinis, Vincenzo Denaro","The rehabilitation of those who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) is a complex process that involves many factors. Physical ability recovery is not the only factor in the return to sport; psychosocial factors such as anxiety, pain response, self-esteem, locus of control, and fear of re-injury also play an important role. A systematic search was conducted on the PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL and Embase databases using the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINOR) was used to assess the quality of the identified non-RCT studies. A total of 308 studies were identified, of which 32 met the eligibility criteria. The results of these studies were obtained using the KOOS (ADL, Sport, QoL), ACL, TSK-11, K-SES, questionnaires/interviews, and other scales as instrumental approaches. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that psychological factors have a significant influence on the post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction outcomes of athletes. Fear of re-injury and pain were the primary factors that limited return to sport, whereas self-efficacy, psychological will, and age were associated with better functional outcomes and were essential for male and young patients. Clinicians should focus on both physical and psychological components to optimize rehabilitation.",1

It can provide a strong tactical advantage; for this reason, all of its components (sprint, speed, and ball control) are fundamental to the development of young players. Dribbling can also be considered a decision-making process, and due to its characteristics, it is not always easy to study ecologically. Using a video analysis study, this research aimed to determine whether dribbling skills, specifically dribbling choice (i.e., decision-making), were related to U10 soccer players' quality.Several outcomes measures, divided into three categories, were taken during video analyses: (i) measures related to the efficacy of dribbling skill; (ii) measures related to the ability of players without the ball to support the player in possession; and (iii) measures related to ball circulation. These data were retrospectively assessed to whether the coaches had formed the teams in training through an implicit knowledge of the players' dribbling skills.The percentage of accurate dribbling (that is, the ability to perform correct passes after a successful dribble) was found to be the variable that coaches may have implicitly used in creating the three groups differentiated by technical skills (p < 0.05). In fact, this percentage was 12.9%, 24.0%, and 48.1% for the groups with lower, average, and higher technical skills, respectively.Overall, the results demonstrate that dribbling accuracy has an important weight in the coach's evaluation of the technical skills level of young soccer players.",1
Building Bridges Instead of Putting Up Walls: Connecting the “Teams” to Improve Soccer Players’ Support,2023-07-22,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"João Renato Silva, Martin Buchheit, Karim Hader, Hugo Sarmento, José Afonso","The increase in the economic value of soccer occurred in parallel with an increase in competing demands. Therefore, clubs and federations evolved to greater specialization (e.g., state-of-the-art facilities and high-profile expertise staff) to support players' performance and health. Currently, player preparation is far from exclusively club or national team centered, and the lack of control in each player's environment can be more prevalent than expected. For example, an elite group of professional players faces disruptions in the season club-oriented planification due to involvement in national teams. Moreover, as elite players' financial resources grow, it is common for them to employ specialized personal staff (e.g., strength and conditioning, nutritionist, and sports psychologist) to assist in their preparation, resulting in complex three-fold relationships (i.e., club, player's staff, national team). Although efforts have been made to improve communication with and transition from the club to the national team supervision, this new reality (club-players' staff) may generate serious compound role-related problems and difficulties in monitoring load and training adaptation and having a unified message. Therefore, efforts must be implemented to ensure a more informed management of the players' performance environment, where the existence and impact of these various personal staff are considered to avoid a long-term non-zero sum for all intervening parties. If left unchecked, current professional thinking may collide or overlap, potentially triggering conflict escalation and impairing athletic performance or health, especially if effective communication routes are not adequately established. Moreover, diluted personal responsibility regarding performance may ensue, resulting in decreased productivity from all involved, which may cause more harm than benefits for the player's overall health and performance. This emerging reality calls for developing a joint working framework (i.e., between the player's personalized support team and the clubs' team) and better managing of a player-centered process.",1

Demographic information and two questionnaires; the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score and the International Hip Outcome Tool 33 were collected. Hand-held dynamometry was used to measure isometric hip strength for flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare strength measures between groups.190 football players with hip/groin pain (mean ± standard deviation age, 27.8 ± 6.3 years) and 64 controls (age, 27.3 ± 5.6 years) were included in this study.

In Vivo Strain Patterns in the Achilles Tendon During Dynamic Activities: A Comprehensive Survey of the Literature,2023-07-19,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Naomi C. Adam, Colin R. Smith, Walter Herzog, Andrew A. Amis, Adamantios Arampatzis, William R. Taylor","Abstract Achilles’ tendon (AT) injuries such as ruptures and tendinopathies have experienced a dramatic rise in the mid- to older-aged population. Given that the AT plays a key role at all stages of locomotion, unsuccessful rehabilitation after injury often leads to long-term, deleterious health consequences. Understanding healthy in vivo strains as well as the complex muscle–tendon unit interactions will improve access to the underlying aetiology of injuries and how their functionality can be effectively restored post-injury. The goals of this survey of the literature with a systematic search were to provide a benchmark of healthy AT strains measured in vivo during functional activities and identify the sources of variability observed in the results. Two databases were searched, and all articles that provided measured in vivo peak strains or the change in strain with respect to time were included. In total, 107 articles that reported subjects over the age of 18 years with no prior AT injury and measured while performing functional activities such as voluntary contractions, walking, running, jumping, or jump landing were included in this review. In general, unclear anatomical definitions of the sub-tendon and aponeurosis structures have led to considerable confusion in the literature. MRI, ultrasound, and motion capture were the predominant approaches, sometimes coupled with modelling. The measured peak strains increased from 4% to over 10% from contractions, to walking, running, and jumping, in that order. Importantly, measured AT strains were heavily dependent on measurement location, measurement method, measurement protocol, individual AT geometry, and mechanical properties, as well as instantaneous kinematics and kinetics of the studied activity. Through a comprehensive review of approaches and results, this survey of the literature therefore converges to a united terminology of the structures and their common underlying characteristics and presents the state-of-knowledge on their functional strain patterns.",1

Forty-five healthy female soccer players were randomly divided into a regular stretching group, a regular stretching group with soleus stretching, and a control group. Dynamic stretching protocols were performed for 4 weeks during three sessions per week as part of routine exercises. The regular group stretched three muscle groups (i.e., gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and hamstrings), while the regular + soleus group also stretched the soleus muscle. Before and after the stretching intervention, the ankle range of motion test, Y-balance test, drop jump test, dynamic knee valgus test, and Illinois Agility Running Test were performed. Ankle ROM, Y-balance, and DJ significantly improved in both intervention groups compared to controls. Only the regular + soleus group showed improvement in the Illinois Agility Running Test. Additionally, athletes performing the additional soleus stretching had greater improvements in ankle ROM and DJ but not in DKV or Y-balance. The results showed that adding soleus stretching into regular protocols can provide benefits for female soccer players in terms of performance parameters.",1

Method The sample consisted of 22 young male soccer players (13.83 ± 0.44 years). A set of variables related to lower limb strength and power, dynamic balance, linear sprint, and change of direction was measured. Results Overall, a non-significant field position was observed. The countermovement jump ( p &lt; 0.001, η 2 = 0.73), squat jump ( p &lt; 0.001), and 30 m linear sprint ( p = 0.001) were the main variables responsible for establishing the clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by a high slalom, i.e ., it took longer to complete the test (speed and change of direction) and a low composite score in the dynamic balance. Cluster 2 was characterized by high squat jump, countermovement jump, and reactive strength ratio (lower limb strength and power). Cluster 3 was characterized by low squat jump and countermovement jump (lower limb strength and power), and a high 30 m sprint, i.e ., it took longer to complete the test (speed and change of direction). Based on the results of the territorial map, the clusters consisted of: (i) cluster 1: two forwards, one midfielder, and five defenders; (ii) cluster 2: three forwards, two midfielders, and two defenders, and; (iii) cluster 3: four midfielders and three defenders. Conclusions Players from different field positions composed the three clusters. There was no cluster composed exclusively of players of the same field position. The development of individualized and specific enrichment training programs should consider a cluster analysis, as the positional effect can be overlooked.",1

When compared with players without disabilities, the process of identifying and developing those with disabilities often requires a diverse perspective. In this chapter, key research findings and implications for practice focused on identifying and developing players within para-soccer are presented using the FA Four Corner Model (i.e., technical/tactical, physical, psychological, and social). Specifically, the potential predictors of talent in para-soccer from sports science disciplines are discussed alongside some of the challenges in developing talented players within the para-soccer pathway. To support a better understanding, this chapter adopts a specific focus on blind soccer to help consider differences in developmental patterns between players with acquired and congenital disabilities. Moreover, the need for an interdisciplinary approach when working with players with disabilities is highlighted. Finally, considerations for researchers and practitioners are offered to help improve the knowledge and practice of talent identification and development in para-soccer.",1
Identifying modifiable risk factors and screening strategies associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury risk in children aged 6 to 13 years: A systematic review,2023-07-18,2023,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Theresa Heering, Tess L Rolley, Natalie Lander, Aaron Fox, Lisa M Barnett, Michael J Duncan","Growing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury incidence is reported in countries across Europe, North America and in Australia for 5–14-year-olds, yet research on injury risk reduction predominantly focuses on populations aged > 13 years. For injury risk reduction, it is crucial to understand (i) which modifiable risk factors are associated with ACL injury in children (6–13 years) and (ii) how these risk factors are assessed. Articles were grouped according to sex/gender and/or maturational/age differences and examined modifiable risk factors during different physical screening tasks. The included articles (n = 40) predominantly examined intrinsic risk factors in girls aged 10–13 years. Factors mechanically linked to increased ACL loading at this age included increased peak knee adductor moments, knee valgus angles, hip and knee extension, and ground reaction forces. Assessment focused on laboratory-based assessments (e.g., motion capture, force plates). This review concluded that modifiable risk factors are present in children aged 6–13 years and that injury risk reduction strategies should be implemented as early as possible regardless of sex/gender. Further, screening strategies need updating to be childhood specific and feasible for the wide community. Additional research on extrinsic risk factors, norm values and children aged 6–9 years could allow for more targeted risk reduction strategies.",1

Effects of plyometric training on technical skill performance among athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2023-07-17,2023,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Nuannuan Deng, Kim Geok Soh, Borhannudin Abdullah, Dandan Huang, Wensheng Xiao, Huange Liu","The literature has proven that plyometric training (PT) improves various physical performance outcomes in sports. Even though PT is one of the most often employed strength training methods, a thorough analysis of PT and how it affects technical skill performance in sports needs to be improved.This study aimed to compile and synthesize the existing studies on the effects of PT on healthy athletes' technical skill performance. A comprehensive search of SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and SPORTDiscus databases was performed on 3rd May 2023. PICOS was employed to establish the inclusion criteria: 1) healthy athletes; 2) a PT program; 3) compared a plyometric intervention to an active control group; 4) tested at least one measure of athletes' technical skill performance; and 5) randomized control designs. The methodological quality of each individual study was evaluated using the PEDro scale. The random-effects model was used to compute the meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed (participant age, gender, PT length, session duration, frequency, and number of sessions). Certainty or confidence in the body of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).Thirty-two moderate-high-quality studies involving 1078 athletes aged 10-40 years met the inclusion criteria. The PT intervention lasted for 4 to 16 weeks, with one to three exercise sessions per week. Small-to-moderate effect sizes were found for performance of throwing velocity (i.e., handball, baseball, water polo) (ES = 0.78; p < 0.001), kicking velocity and distance (i.e., soccer) (ES = 0.37-0.44; all p < 0.005), and speed dribbling (i.e., handball, basketball, soccer) (ES = 0.85; p = 0.014), while no significant effects on stride rate (i.e., running) were noted (ES = 0.32; p = 0.137). Sub-analyses of moderator factors included 16 data sets. Only training length significantly modulated PT effects on throwing velocity (> 7 weeks, ES = 1.05; ≤ 7 weeks, ES = 0.29; p = 0.011). The level of certainty of the evidence for the meta-analyzed outcomes ranged from low to moderate.Our findings have shown that PT can be effective in enhancing technical skills measures in youth and adult athletes. Sub-group analyses suggest that PT longer (> 7 weeks) lengths appear to be more effective for improving throwing velocity. However, to fully determine the effectiveness of PT in improving sport-specific technical skill outcomes and ultimately enhancing competition performance, further high-quality research covering a wider range of sports is required.",1
Pilot Study: The Relationship between Foot Posture and Movement Quality in Non-Professional Male Football Players,2023-07-17,2023,MDPI AG,Life,"José Algaba-Del-Castillo, Aurora Castro-Méndez, Ana Juana Pérez-Belloso, José Gabriel Garrido-Barragán, Alberto Aguilar Sánchez, Manuel Coheña-Jiménez","(1) Background: This study focusses on establishing the relationship between quality of movement (based on the functional movement screen, or FMS) and foot posture (based on the foot posture index, or FPI-6). We hypothesised that a poor FMS test score may be derived from the foot position in the space measured by FPI-6. (2) Methods: a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional study was designed to analyse foot posture in 30 healthy football players, using the foot posture index and the functional movement screen. (3) Results: No significant relationships were found between movement quality and foot posture. Poor movement quality is present in more than half of all foot positions, supination, pronation, and neutral. Good quality seems to be more associated with a neutral foot position (23.3%) and supinated (16.6%) than a pronated foot position (6.6%). (4) Conclusions: this study found no relationship between the two tests; therefore, we cannot demonstrate that foot posture is relevant in the quality of the movement of the football players studied.",1
Ultrasound-Guided Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment for Superficial Peroneal Nerve Entrapment in a Professional Handball Player,2023-07-17,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Rui Martins da Silva, Adriana Pereira, Raquel Branco, José Luís Carvalho","Peripheral nerve injury in athletes is rare but deleterious to their performance, entrapment being one of the most frequent causes. Isolated injury to the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) is rare and often underdiagnosed. The authors reported a clinical case of a 34-year-old handball athlete who presented with neuropathic pain in the inferolateral third of the leg and dorsum of the foot, with three months of evolution, after an ankle sprain, refractory to conservative treatment. After clinical assessment and ultrasound investigation, it was considered that the pain source was likely to be an SPN entrapment. Thus, a diagnostic ultrasound-guided nerve block with 2ml of 2% lidocaine and 3ml of 0.2% ropivacaine was performed, followed by nerve hydrodissection, with a major improvement in the patient's symptoms and functionality for three weeks. Thereafter, a long-lasting alternative was made - pulsed radiofrequency (pRF). There were no complications after the procedure. As a form of neuromodulation, pRF offered pain resolution without tissue damage or painful sequela, after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up and complete participation in sports activity, avoiding surgical treatment. With this clinical case, the authors intend to demonstrate the effectiveness of pRF in the resolution of peripheral neuropathy due to entrapment, avoiding more invasive treatment options and, in the case of an athlete, allowing an early return to play. They also intend to corroborate the advantage of using ultrasound in the diagnosis and guide of minimally invasive procedures.",1
Asymmetries of foot strike patterns during running in high-level female and male soccer players,2023-07-14,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Stanislav Dimitri Siegel, Joel Mason, Daniel Hamacher, Anna Lina Rahlf, Astrid Zech","Abstract Backround Foot strike pattern (FSP) is defined by the way the foot makes initial ground contact and is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This study investigated the effect of running speed on asymmetries of FSP. Methods Seventeen female and nineteen male soccer players performed an incremental running test on an instrumented treadmill starting at 2.0 m/s until complete exhaustion. Force plate data were used to categorize foot strikes into rearfoot (RFS) and non-rearfoot strikes. Additionally, peak vertical ground reaction force (peakGRF) and stride time were calculated. The symmetry index (SI) was used to quantify lateral asymmetries between legs. Results The SI indicated asymmetries of the rate of RFS (%RFS) of approximately 30% at slow running speed which decreased to 4.4% during faster running speed ( p = 0.001). There were minor asymmetries in peakGRF and stride time at each running stage. Running speed influenced %RFS ( p &lt; 0.001), peakGRF ( p &lt; 0.001) and stride time ( p &lt; 0.001). Significant interaction effects between running speed and sex were shown for %RFS ( p = 0.033), peakGRF ( p &lt; 0.001) and stride time ( p = 0.041). Conclusion FSP of soccer players are asymmetric at slower running speed, but symmetry increases with increasing speed. Future studies should consider that FSP are non-stationary and influenced by running speed but also differ between legs.",1
Effects of a proprioceptive focal stimulation (Equistasi®) on reducing the biomechanical risk factors associated with ACL injury in female footballers,2023-07-14,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Fabiola Spolaor, Annamaria Guiotto, Alfredo Ciniglio, Federica Cibin, Zimi Sawacha","Introduction Football presents a high rate of lower limb injuries and high incidence of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rupture, especially in women. Due to this there is the need to optimize current prevention programs. This study aims to verify the possibility to reduce the biomechanical risk factors associated with ACL injury, through the application of proprioceptive stimulation by means of the Equistasi® device. Methods Ten elite female footballers were enrolled and received the device for 4 weeks (5 days/week, 1h/day). Athletes were assessed directly on-field at four time points: T0 and T1 (evaluation without and with the device), T2 (after 2 weeks), T4 (after 4 weeks) while performing two different tasks: Romberg Test, and four sidestep cutting maneuvers bilaterally. Seven video cameras synchronized with a plantar pressure system were used, thirty double colored tapes were applied on anatomical landmarks, and three dimensional coordinates reconstructed. Vertical ground reaction forces and center of pressure data were extracted from the plantar pressure insoles. Hip, knee, and ankle flexion-extension angles and moments were computed as well as abd-adduction joint torques. From the Romberg Test both center of pressure descriptive variables and frequency analysis parameters were extracted. Each variable was compared among the different time frames, T1, T2 and T4, through Friedman Test for non-parametric repeated measures (p&amp;lt;0.05); Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used for comparing variables between T0 and T1 (p&amp;lt;0.05) and across the different time frames as follows: T1–T2, T2–T4 and T1–T4. Results Statistically significant differences in both posturographic and biomechanical variables between the assessment at T0 and T1 were detected. Reduced hip and knee abduction torques were revealed in association with reduced both ground reaction forces and ankle dorsiflexion torque from T1 up to T4. Discussion The proprioceptive stimuli showed to have the potential to improve cutting biomechanics mainly with respect to the ligament and quadriceps dominance theories. Results of the present study, even if preliminary and on a small sample size, could be considered promising towards the inclusion of proprioceptive training in injury prevention programs.",1
The Effects of FIFA 11+ Kids Prevention Program on Kinematic Risk Factors for ACL Injury in Preadolescent Female Soccer Players: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2023-07-12,2023,MDPI AG,Children,"Maedeh Taghizadeh Kerman, Claudia Brunetti, Ali Yalfani, Ahmad Ebrahimi Atri, Chiarella Sforza","This study aimed to investigate the effects of the 8-week FIFA 11+ Kids program on kinematic risk factors for ACL injury in preadolescent female soccer players during single-leg drop landing. For this, 36 preadolescent female soccer players (10-12 years old) were randomly allocated to the FIFA 11+ Kids program and control groups (18 players per group). The intervention group performed the FIFA 11+ Kids warm-up program twice per week for 8 weeks, while the control group continued with regular warm-up. Trunk, hip, and knee peak angles (from initial ground contact to peak knee flexion) were collected during the single-leg drop landing using a 3D motion capture system. A repeated measure ANOVA was used to analyze groups over time. Significant group × time interactions were found for the peak knee flexion, with a medium effect size (p = 0.05; effect size = 0.11), and peak hip internal rotation angles, with a large effect size (p < 0.01; effect size = 0.28). We found that the FIFA 11+ Kids program was effective in improving knee flexion and hip internal rotation, likely resulting in reducing ACL stress during single-leg drop landing in young soccer players.",1

Prevalence and characteristics of sports injuries in athletes with flat feet: A quantitative descriptive study,2023-07-08,2023,UIR Press,Journal Sport Area,"Arif Setiawan, Priyanto, Dewangga Yudhistira","The study of sports injuries is a crucial and captivating topic that requires thorough exploration. Understanding and effectively managing sports injuries is essential for coaches, instructors, and athletes. However, there is limited awareness among sports practitioners, particularly regarding flat foot conditions. Therefore, this research aims to identify common injuries among athletes with flat feet through a comprehensive survey. Employing a quantitative descriptive method with a survey-based approach. This study included a sample of 89 male athletes who sought treatment for sports-related injuries at massage clinics. Data collection techniques encompassed observations, interviews, questionnaires, and measurement tests. Purposive sampling was utilised for participant selection. Wet footprint tests, stature metres, weight scales, and questionnaires were employed for data collection. Data analysis employed the percentage formula and was supported by Excel software. The findings indicated that athletes with flat feet were more susceptible to knee injuries (69%), ankle injuries (31%), external causes of injury (22%), internal causes of injury (52%), and overuse injuries (26%). These results imply that athletes with flat feet who seek treatment at massage clinics commonly experience knee and ankle injuries, with internal trauma being the leading cause. This study contributes to a better understanding of injury identification among individuals with flat feet, aiding in the selection of appropriate sports activities. Limitations of this study include a single research site, an uneven distribution of sports disciplines, and a male-only sample. Future research should employ more comprehensive methods and ensure representative samples across various sports to facilitate proper generalisation of the data.",1

This review presents a methodological proposal for classifying eccentric exercises based on complexity, objectives, methods, and intensity. We discuss the rationale and physiological implications of eccentric training, considering its benefits and risks. The proposed classification system considers exercise complexity and categorizing exercises by technical requirements and joint involvement, accommodating various skill levels. Additionally, training objectives are addressed, including (i) Sports Rehabilitation and Return To Sport, (ii) Muscle Development, (iii) Injury Prevention, (iv) Special Populations, and (v) Sporting Performance, proposing exercise selection with desired outcomes. The review also highlights various eccentric training methods, such as tempo, isoinertial, plyometrics, and moderate eccentric load, each with different benefits. The classification system also integrates intensity levels, allowing for progressive overload and individualized adjustments. This methodological proposal provides a framework for organizing eccentric resistance training programs, facilitating exercise selection, program design, and progression. Furthermore, it assists trainers, coaches, and professionals in optimizing eccentric training’s benefits, promoting advancements in research and practical application. In conclusion, this methodological proposal offers a systematic approach for classifying eccentric exercises based on complexity, objectives, methods, and intensity. It enhances exercise selection, program design, and progression in eccentric resistance training according to training objectives and desired outcomes.",1
Understanding the variability in rotational traction testing on artificial turf,2023-07-07,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"Harry McGowan, Paul Fleming, David James, Steph Forrester","Abstract Rotational traction is a key parameter used by sporting governing bodies to determine the safety and performance of artificial turf surfaces. Currently, the Federation Internationale de Football uses two devices for measuring rotational traction: a statically loaded rotational traction tester and a lightweight rotational traction tester, loaded by the operator. Variability in measurements emanates from two main sources: inconsistencies in the turf and the manual operation of both testers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contributions from the turf and the manual operation of the testers to the total variability in peak torque measurements, achieved by comparing results from both manually operated rotational traction testers with an automated rotational traction tester. Five experienced operators used the manual testers to conduct 15 rotational traction tests on four different artificial turf surfaces. The automated tester measured rotational traction on each surface 15 times. The results revealed the turf system contributed over 50% of the total variability for both manually operated testers, on all four surfaces. The lightweight tester produced greater between (inter)-operator variability, but lower within (intra)-operator variability compared to the standard rotational traction tester. Operator height appeared to influence results for the lightweight tester, but not for the standard tester. The results support the continued use of manual rotational traction testers for commercial compliance field testing of artificial turf surfaces; however, they indicate the need to further explore the effects of manual operation on both devices.",1

"The effect of foot posture on static balance, ankle and knee proprioception in 18-to-25-year-old female student: a cross-sectional study",2023-07-04,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Maryam Ghorbani, Rasoul Yaali, Hassan Sadeghi, Tony Luczak","Abstract Background &amp; purpose Afferent input from the sole affects postural stability. Cutaneous reflexes from the foot are important to posture and gait. Lower-limb afferents alone provide enough information to maintain upright stance and are critical in perceiving postural sway. Altered feedback from propreoceptive receptors alters gait and patterns of muscle activation. The position and posture of the foot and ankle may also play an important role in proprioceptive input.Therefore, the current research aims to compare static balance and ankle and knee proprioception in people with and without flexible flatfeet. Methodology 91 female students between the ages of 18 and 25 voluntarily participated in this study, of which 24 were in the flexible flatfoot group and 67 were in the regular foot group after evaluating the longitudinal arch of the foot. The position sense of ankle and knee joints were measured using the active reconstruction test of the ankle and knee angle; Static balance was measured using the Sharpened Romberg test. Data were non-normally distributed. Accordingly, non-parametric tests were applied. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare differences between groups in variables. Result Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference between two groups of flat feet and normal feet in the variables of static balance and position sense of ankle plantarflexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and knee flexion (p ≤ 0.05). A significant correlation was found between static balance and sense of ankle and knee position in the group with normal feet. The analysis of the regression line also showed that ankle and knee position sense could predict the static balance score in the regular foot group (ankle dorsiflexion position sense 17% (R 2 = 0.17), ankle plantarflexion position sense 17% (R 2 = 0.17) and knee flexion position sense 46% (R 2 = 0.46) explain of changes in static balance). Discussion &amp; conclusion Flexible flatfoot soles can cause loss of balance and sense of joint position; therefore, according to this preliminary study, clinicians must be aware and should take into account this possible deficit in the management of these patients.",1
Muscle architecture and sports performance,2023-07-01,2023,Comprehensive Publications,Journal of Sports Science and Nutrition,"Shashvat Priyam Khare, T Onima Reddy, Dr. Ajay Kumar, Dr. Anurodh Sisodia","This research delves into the critical role of muscle architecture in determining muscle function and sports performance. It focuses on three key components: pennation angle, fascicle length, and muscle thickness. The pennation angle impacts force production and the physiological cross-sectional area of the muscle, while longer fascicle lengths enable muscles to achieve higher shortening velocities, making them more suitable for tasks requiring quick and powerful movements. The study also emphasizes the potential of advanced imaging techniques such as three-dimensional muscle imaging and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging in providing comprehensive insights into muscle architecture across different athletic populations. It discusses how biomechanical analysis can be integrated with knowledge about muscle architecture to elucidate the dynamic interplay between muscular structure, force transmission, and athletic movement proficiency. Additionally, it explores how regenerative medicine and tissue engineering could devise novel strategies for enhancing repair of muscular architecture following injuries or degenerative changes. Lastly, it outlines promising future research directions focusing on revolutionizing athletic training through a multidimensional approach that encompasses molecular elucidation, sophisticated imaging modalities, biochemical integration, and regenerative innovations without comprising injury prevention or performance optimization.",1
Paper 61: NCAA Football Players are at Higher Risk of Upper Extremity Injury After Concussion,2023-07-01,2023,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Justin Castonguay, Ashley Thompson, Ioanna Bolia, Frank Petrigliano, Joseph Liu, Seth Gamradt, Alexander Weber, Carson Gardner","Objectives: Sport related concussion has been repeatedly demonstrated to increase the risk of subsequent lower extremity injury in athletes. The current literature suggests that, for multiple years after a concussion, athletes are at increased risk of lower extremity injury. However, we are unaware of any studies that have demonstrated an increase in risk for upper extremity injuries after sport related concussion. The purpose of this study was to investigate a change in the risk of upper extremity injuries for NCAA football players after return to play from a sport related concussion. Methods: The Sports Injury Research Archive (SIRA) of a single NCAA athletic conference was queried for de-identified injury data on concussions and upper extremity injuries. All football players diagnosed with a concussion and recorded in the database were identified between 2017-2021. Athletes were excluded if their concussion was not sport related, if they had multiple concussions, or if they did not return to previous activity level in their respective sport. Each concussed athlete was then retrospectively followed for the year prior to their concussion as well as for one year after their concussion, beginning at 3 months after the date of their concussion. If the athlete was known to have not returned to play within 3 months they were excluded from the study. All upper extremity injuries were identified in the year prior to concussion and for the previously described year after the concussion. The mean number of concussions per athlete were identified in the pre-concussion and post-concussion groups. The odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and statistical significance between groups were calculated using Microsoft Excel. Results: After exclusions, 230 de-identified football players from a single conference were identified with concussions from the 2017 through 2021 NCAA football seasons. In these athletes there were a total of 60 upper extremity injuries in the year preceding concussion and a total of 111 in the year they were followed after concussion. The mean number of upper extremity injuries per athlete in the year prior to concussion was 0.26, and in the post-concussion athletes was 0.48. The odds of upper extremity injury in the post-concussion year were 1.85 times higher than in the pre-concussion year (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.29 – 2.66, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The data collected in this study demonstrates that collegiate football players are at higher risk of upper extremity injury after concussion. Multiple studies have shown an increased risk of lower extremity injury in athletes after sport related concussion. This study is the first to demonstrate an increased risk of injury specifically in the upper extremities after concussion. The explanation for why these athletes’ injury risk changes after concussion is still not fully understood. Prior research has shown that athletes have alterations in their balance, gait, and landing biomechanics after concussion, which could possibly be causative in upper extremity injuries. Various studies have investigated changes in the coupling between perception and reaction amongst athletes after head injury and have theorized these changes as potential causes of the increase in injury risk. Another consideration is simply that athletes may change the way they approach their sport after sustaining a concussion. Further research on the topic should aim at characterizing the types of injuries that portend the largest increase in risk, exploring different sports, and investigating the magnitude of the risk at longer post-concussion time points. Delineating a clear explanation for why athletes have increased risk of injury after concussion is worthy of future research.",1
Paper 41: Increased Knee Valgus and Hip Adduction Moments after Hamstring Autograft compared to Quadriceps Autograft in Adolescents 6 Months after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2023-07-01,2023,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Neeraj Vij, Kaycee Glattke, Joseph Brinkman, Jenni Winters, Seyed Hadi Salehi, Sixue Zhao, Anikar Chhabra, Jeffrey Vaughn, Heather Menzer, Sailesh Tummala","Objectives: Evidence is limited related to the effects of autograft type on functional performance during gait lab-based functional testing after ACL reconstruction (ACLR), especially the quadriceps autograft. The goal of this study was to compare biomechanical outcomes as measured by 3D motion analysis during the drop vertical test between quadriceps autograft with bone block (QB), quadriceps autograft without bone block (Q), hamstring autograft (HS), and bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BTB) six-months postoperatively in an adolescent population. We hypothesized that the quadriceps groups would demonstrate decreased knee extension moments as compared to the hamstring autograft group without other significant differences. Methods: Patients aged 8-18 years who underwent primary ACLR were included. Patients with previous history of ipsilateral knee surgery were excluded. Kinematic and kinetic data collected during a drop vertical jump test in a formal gait lab using a computerized video-based system (Motion Analysis Corp. CORTEX software) was collected six months after ACLR and compared to the uninjured contralateral limb. The Kruskal Wallis test and subsequent pairwise comparisons were carried out for each studied parameter. Primary outcomes included transverse plane hip power, hip internal rotation moment, knee valgus angles, and knee extensor moments between the graft types. Secondary outcomes included hip abduction moment, knee valgus moment, and knee external rotation moment. Results: A total of 155 subjects’ charts were included for review, with 54, 40, 35, and 26 subjects in the HS, QB, Q, and BTB groups respectively. There were no significant differences in terms of age, sex, or affected leg (p &gt; 0.1973). Athletic activity for each subject was also noted when appropriate, including soccer (37), basketball (34), and American football (30). The QB group had smaller knee extension moments maximums (-0.97 N*m/kg vs. -0.35 N*m/kg, p = 0.0323) and smaller knee extension moment averages (-0.12 N*m/kg vs. -0.03 N*m/kg, p = 0.0265) as compared to the HS group. The Q group demonstrated smaller knee extension moment averages (-0.13 N*m/kg vs. -0.03 N*m/kg, p = 0.459) as compared to the HS group. Analysis of secondary outcomes revealed that the HS group demonstrated larger knee valgus moments at initial contact (0.28 N*m/kg vs -0.35 N*m/kg, p = 0.0254) as compared to the Q group. The HS group demonstrated significantly larger hip adduction moment maximums (0.30 N*m/kg vs -0.04 N*m/kg, p = 0.0426) and smaller knee external rotation moment averages (-0.02 N*m/kg vs 0.02 N*m/kg, p = 0.0206) as compared to the QB group. No other secondary outcomes were statistically significant between any of the groups. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the quadriceps autograft may confer improved knee coronal plane biomechanics in regard to ACL reinjury rates when compared to a hamstring autograft at 6 months after ACLR in adolescent patients performing a drop vertical jump. The hamstring autograft group was significantly associated with larger knee valgus moments at initial contact as compared to the quadriceps autograft without bone block and significantly larger hip adduction moments compared to the quadriceps autograft with bone block. Both quadriceps grafts were shown to demonstrate significantly decreased knee extension moments as compared to a hamstring autograft. Further long-term clinical studies may be useful in determining whether the apparent biomechanical differences seen between autograft types are correlated with reinjury rates.",1
Poster 356: Injury patterns of Achilles tendon ruptures: a systematic video analysis of 80 cases in professional male football,2023-07-01,2023,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Thomas Gronwald, Christian Klein, Karsten Hollander, Peter Ueblacker, Tim Rolvien, Tim Hoenig","Objectives: Achilles tendon ruptures are injuries with a high severity. Analyses of underlying biomechanical and situational patterns may promote a better understanding of Achilles tendon ruptures and aid in their management and prevention. However, a systematic biomechanical and situational video analysis of real-life Achilles tendon ruptures has not been performed to date. Methods: Professional male football players with an acute Achilles tendon rupture were identified by using an online database (Transfermarkt.com, Hamburg, Germany). For every in-competition injury, the coinciding football match leading to injury was detected. Video files of the injuries were accessed using Wyscout.com (Wyscout.com, Genova, Italy). Situational patterns and injury biomechanics of the injury frame were independently analyzed by two reviewers using a standardized checklist and a motion analysis software (Kinovea v.0.8.15, www.kinovea.org). Finally, consensus was reached to describe the main injury patterns of Achilles tendon ruptures in professional male football. Results: Overall, 80 injuries were included for video analysis. Most injuries (94%) were indirect or non- contact injuries. The kinematic analysis revealed a knee extension movement and an ankle dorsiflexion movement in most cases. Typical joint positions at the assumed injury frame were hip extension, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion. Player actions identified as main injury patterns were stepping back, landing, running/sprinting, starting, and jumping. All main patterns were closed-chain movements (that is, fixation of the affected leg to the ground). Conclusions: Most Achilles tendon ruptures share characteristic injury features, that is, Achilles tendon elongation, closed-chain movements, and sudden loading. The findings of this study allow insight into injury mechanisms of Achilles tendon ruptures in professional male football and may support translation towards future development of prevention programs.",1
Effects of Foot Structure Type on Core Stability in University Athletes,2023-06-30,2023,MDPI AG,Life,"Orlando Santiago Moreno-Barriga, Carlos Romero-Morales, Ricardo Becerro-de-Bengoa-Vallejo, Marta Elena Losa-Iglesias, Juan Gómez-Salgado, Julio Caballero-López, Liz Carol Vidal-Valverde, Daniel López-López","This study assessed the impact of different types of medial foot arch on postural stability and core center of gravity muscle activity among collegiate athletes.The study sample included 103 university-level athletes across various sports (soccer, rugby, basketball, volleyball, field tennis, table tennis, karate, and cheerleading) from the College of Magdalena (Colombia) who exhibited distinct types of medial foot arch: 32 high, 35 low, and 36 neutral arches. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was employed to assess conduction velocity, magnitude values, latency, and fatigue in focal muscles including the spinal erector (SE), internal oblique (IO), external oblique (EO), and rectus abdominis (AR), while measurements of static and dynamic postural control were also considered. Post hoc analysis was performed with Bonferroni correction for all electromyographically measured muscle groups, as well as for measurements of static and dynamic postural stability. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation tests were used to compare the different types of feet.There were no substantial differences observed between the distinct types of feet in terms of focal muscle activity, static stability, or dynamics. Even though the mean values indicated higher muscle activity and stability among those with high foot arches and lower values among those with low arches compared to the neutral foot type, this observed difference was deemed statistically insignificant. We also observed a positive correlation between internal oblique muscle activity and the average power of dynamic postural stability, which remained consistent across all foot types. Our findings indicate that static instability is directly correlated with dynamic instability in the anteroposterior direction, while a clear inverse relationship was established in the lateral direction upon examining the variable correlations.The presence of high or low foot arches did not significantly impact the activity of the muscles responsible for maintaining the body's center of gravity or postural stability among university-level athletes. This suggests the existence of neuromuscular compensation mechanisms that attempt to restore balance and compensate for any changes in postural stability caused by varying foot types. Through targeted training that emphasizes activation of the internal oblique muscle, athletes may see improved postural stability. Our findings indicate that static stabilization exercises can also prove beneficial in improving dynamic stability in the anteroposterior plane, while a more dynamic approach may be required to improve dynamic stability in the lateral plane.",1
"Pre-Season ACL Risk Classification of Professional and Semi-Professional Football Players, via a Proof-of-Concept Test Battery",2023-06-30,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Charis Tsarbou, Nikolaos I. Liveris, Sofia A. Xergia, Maria Tsekoura, Konstantinos Fousekis, Elias Tsepis","This study aimed to identify football players at high risk (HR) for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury via a four-test battery and assess possible factors affecting classification. Ninety-one professional and semi-professional male athletes participated in a field-based pre-season screening. The cut-off points of the test battery were 10% acknowledged inter-limb asymmetry limit for quadriceps and hamstring isometric strength and single-leg triple hop for distance, in addition to the upper limit of 6 errors in the landing error scoring system (LESS). Additional assessment of hip adductors and core stability completed the global functional profile of the players. Sixty-one players were identified as HR and thirty as low-risk (LR) for ACL injury. Discriminant analysis showed that the proposed test battery classified accurately 78.0% of them, with 91.8 sensitivity and 61.9% specificity. Only four misclassified players in the LR group were at risk of inadequate treatment. All participants were considered healthy, and history of a previously rehabilitated injury did not interfere with the results. LESS seems to be the best predictor for injury-risk grouping. Prone bridge time was also a whole-body variable discriminating between groups. The proposed test battery provides a promising option for field-based pre-season ACL risk assessment of football players and needs to be studied prospectively.",1
Are hip biomechanics during running associated with symptom severity or cam morphology size in male football players with FAI syndrome?,2023-06-30,2023,Elsevier BV,Gait &amp; Posture,"Mark J. Scholes, Benjamin F. Mentiplay, Joanne L. Kemp, Matthew G. King, Anthony G. Schache, Joshua J. Heerey, Prasanna Sritharan, Adam I. Semciw, Rintje Agricola, Kay M. Crossley","Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome is considered a motion-related condition. Little is known about the influence of symptom severity and cam morphology on hip biomechanics for individuals with FAI syndrome.Are hip biomechanics during running associated with symptom severity or cam morphology size in male football players with FAI syndrome?Forty-nine male, sub-elite football (soccer or Australian football) players (mean age= 26 years) with FAI syndrome completed the International Hip Outcome Tool-33 (iHOT-33) and Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and underwent radiographic evaluation. Biomechanical data were collected during overground running (3-3.5 m∙s-1) using three-dimensional motion capture technology and an embedded force plate. Various discrete hip angles and impulses of joint moments were analysed during the stance phase. Linear regression models investigated associations between running biomechanics data (dependent variables) and iHOT-33 and HAGOS scores and cam morphology size (independent variables).Hip joint angles during running were not associated with symptom severity in football players with FAI syndrome. A positive association was found between the impulse of the hip external rotation moment and HAGOS-Sport scores, such that a smaller impulse magnitude occurred with a lower HAGOS-Sport score (0.026 *10-2 [95%CI <0.001 *10-2 to 0.051 *10-2], P = 0.048). Larger cam morphology was associated with a greater peak hip adduction angle at midstance (0.073 [95%CI 0.002-0.145], P = 0.045).Hip biomechanics during running did not display strong associations with symptom severity or cam morphology size in male football players with FAI syndrome who were still participating in training and match play. Future studies might consider investigating associations during tasks that utilise end range hip joint motion or require greater muscle forces.",1
Investigation of the relationship between isokinetic lower extremity strength and the vertical jump parameter in elite women football players,2023-06-29,2023,Sergii Iermakov,Pedagogy of Physical Culture and Sports,"Mehmet Soyal, Ömer Aksoy, Onur Şengöl, Sefa Kılıç","Background and Study Aim. It can be said that recently, with the popularity of women's football and playing at a professional level, physical and physiological needs have increased. In this context, this study was conducted to examine the relationship between isokinetic lower extremity strength and vertical jump parameters in elite female football players. Material and Methods. The model of the research was the relational survey model, one of the survey models. The research group consisted of 26 volunteer professional female football players competing at the Turkish women's super league level. The maximum strength of the knee extensor and flexor muscles of female soccer players was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer device (Cybex NORM®, Humac, CA, USA) that allows the recording of instant isokinetic torque. The vertical jump test data of the female football players were determined with the Fusion Sport-Smart Jump brand jump mat. While SPSS 25.0 package program was used for statistical analysis evaluation, correlation analysis was applied to compare the relationship between isokinetic lower extremity strength and vertical jump parameter. Results. When the participants' vertical jump, right knee flexion and extension degrees were examined, a moderate positive correlation was found between the vertical jump parameter and the 240s Flexion Right %Body Weight values, and no relationship was found between the other parameters and the vertical jump. A moderate positive correlation was detected between the vertical jump parameter and 240s Flexion Left %Body Weight. Another moderate positive correlation was found between the vertical jump parameter and 240s Extension Left %Body Weight values. At the same time, no relation was found between other parameters and vertical jumps. Conclusions. As a result, when the study results were evaluated, a positive relationship was determined between vertical jump and right knee flexion parameters and similarly left knee flexion-extension parameters. Based on this situation, it was concluded that the contraction levels of the lower extremity strength, which plays an important role in determining the performance in the football branch, contribute positively to the jump performance.",1

In this study, we investigated the effects of a custom-designed shoe CS on muscular activity, dynamic stability, and leg stiffness (Kleg) during running using a biomimetic design approach inspired by the mechanisms of ankle sprain prevention. Sixteen healthy male participants ran on a treadmill while wearing a custom-designed high-collar shoe with low, medium, and high CS conditions, measured using circumferential ankle pressure (CAP). Lower extremity kinematics and electromyography (EMG) data were recorded simultaneously. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to compare the CS conditions. Results indicate that high and medium CS conditions significantly reduce sagittal and frontal ankle ranges of motion (ROMs) compared to the low CS condition, providing improved stability and support against lateral ankle sprain; moreover, there was a trend towards higher dynamic stability and Kleg with increasing CS. Our study highlights the importance of considering the CAP in regulating high-collar stiffness properties and how higher CS may provide better support for the ankle during running. Nevertheless, additional research is necessary to validate the efficacy of the current design in preventing ankle sprains during high-demand activities.",1

However, limited research has been conducted on the relationship between training intensity and wellness status in young football players. This study included 123 young football players and 8 coaches from the Malta Football Regional Centers (MFRH) U12/13 and U14 groups. Participation in the study was based on voluntary basis and each age group underwent two training sessions per week. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the wellness status, mental and physical intensity of football players, and the planned and perceived mental and physical intensity of coaches. The main findings of the study showed a negative relationship between football players' pre-training wellness scores and their perceived (post-training) RPE, as well as coaches' perceived (post-training) RPE. This result indicates that coaches did not use the wellness questionnaire in the training planning process. In addition, a negative relationship was found between football players' perceived (post-training) RPE and their mental fatigue perception, suggesting that mental fatigue can occur independently of physical training intensity. Planned (pre-training) RPE scores of coaches were found to have a positive relationship with young football players' perceived (post-training) RPE scores, indicating that coaches were effective in planning and controlling training intensity. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of using wellness questionnaires in managing training intensity in young football players.",1

"Effects of FIFA 11+ program on speed, body balance and leg muscle power to prevent injury among football club university player",2023-06-24,2023,DJ Studio Dariusz Jasinski,Fizjoterapia Polska,"Yudha Febrianta, Mahendra Wahyu Dewangga, Kusnandar Kusnandar, Indra Jati Kusuma, Panuwun Joko Nurcahyo, Waskito Aji Suryo Putro","Introduction. Football is the most popular sport in Indonesia. In a football match, the game lasts 2 x 45 minutes. However, football players are often injured due to collisions and errors in landing after jumping. Some factors that increase the occurrence of injuries are poor leg muscle power, poor balance, and poor running speed. FIFA created FIFA 11+ as a training program to guard against sports-related injuries to football players. However, although there has been quite a lot of research related to the FIFA 11+ training program in Indonesia, there still needs to be more research on the provision of the FIFA 11+ training program. Purpose. This study aims to determine the effect of the FIFA 11+ training program on body balance, speed, and leg muscle power. Methods. This experimental study has a one-group pretest and posttest design. The research was conducted at the Muhammadiyah University Football Club in Purwokerto, Indonesia. The population sample consists of 42 boys between the ages of 18 and 23. FIFA 11+ practice is provided over 4 weeks (2 sessions in 1 week). The data obtained was then tested for Pearson product-moment correlation and multiple regression correlation tests using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) application version 26. Results. The results showed that after the FIFA 11+ training program, there was a significant increase in body balance, lower leg muscle power, and speed. This was proven in the effect test, with SPSS showing results of p &lt; 0.05. Conclusion. Based on the results and discussion above, the FIFA 11+ program significantly increases body balance, leg muscle power, and running speed.",1

The influence of different levels of physical activity and sports performance on the accuracy of dynamic lower limbs balance assessment among Chinese physical education college students,2023-06-21,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Xuejuan Huang, Zhiyang Yan, Yong Ma, Hua Liu","Background: Balance ability is the basis of human actions. Improving the accuracy of dynamic balance assessment can increase the efficiency of sports injury prediction. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate how physical activity and sports performance affect the dynamic balance ability of lower limbs and validate whether the Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (YBT-LQ) is a reliable predictor of sports injury risk among Chinese physical education college students. Materials and Methods: In total, 169 voluntary participants completed the YBT-LQ at the beginning of a semester and provided some physiological information and an injury report at the end of the semester. The correlation between YBT-LQ performance and selected factors that can affect the dynamic balance control was analyzed based on data statistics. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the area under curve (AUC) of the composite scores of the YBT-LQ were calculated to explore an optimal cutoff value for predicting sports injury risk. Results: The composite scores of the YBT-LQ exhibited strong correlations with both the sports performance level and sports injury, as well as a moderate correlation with physical activity level, age (negative), and metabolic equivalent (MET). In the entire study population, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the binary classification of composite YBT-LQ scores of the left and right legs to predict sports injury risk were 0.78 and 0.74, respectively. Stratifying the study participants based on their levels of physical activity and sports performance had an effect on the AUC values of ROC curves. The optimal cutoff scores of the YBT-LQ for predicting sports injury risk were variable, with values more or less than 95%. Specifically, the cutoff scores for participants with the highest level of sports performance were notably higher, reaching up to 106.5% (left) and 107.2% (right). Conclusion: Physical activity and sports performance can influence human dynamic balance control. Composite scores of the YBT-LQ can be used with acceptable efficiency to predict sports injury. Stratifying participants based on their levels of physical activity and sports performance leads to different optimal cutoff values of the YBT-LQ composite scores in predicting sports injury. This approach is preferable to relying solely on a uniform 95% cutoff. It is recommended to analyze individuals with higher levels of sports performance, such as elite athletes, separately from those with lower levels. This is because the former group has a higher optimal cutoff value compared to the latter.",1

We create a position exposure matrix (PEM), composed of American football helmet sensor data, summarized from literature review by player position and level of play. Using this PEM, we estimate measures of lifetime RHI exposure for a separate cohort of 631 football playing brain donors. Separate models examine the relationship between CTE pathology and players' concussion count, athletic positions, years of football, and PEM-derived measures, including estimated cumulative head impacts, linear accelerations, and rotational accelerations. Only duration of play and PEM-derived measures are significantly associated with CTE pathology. Models incorporating cumulative linear or rotational acceleration have better model fit and are better predictors of CTE pathology than duration of play or cumulative head impacts alone. These findings implicate cumulative head impact intensity in CTE pathogenesis.",1
Role of ankle dorsiflexion in sports performance and injury risk: A narrative review,2023-06-19,2023,Modestum Ltd,Electronic Journal of General Medicine,"Haifa Saleh Almansoof, Shibili Nuhmani, Qassim Muaidi","The objective of this literature review is to understand the role of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in sports performance and the risk of injuries. The ankle harmonizes the interaction between the body and the supporting surface through adjusting to the supporting surface and handling forces to contribute effectually to different functional activities. Ankle dorsiflexion is an essential construct in many sport-specific skills. Ankle dorsiflexion is associated with activation of brain areas involved in movement preparation, sensory integration, motor planning/execution, balance, and visuomotor coordination. Ankle dorsiflexion was associated with enhanced activation of deep core and quadriceps muscles. Decreased ankle dorsiflexion is linked to compensations and altered kinetics and kinematics that can potentially affect sports performance and increase the chances of sustaining injuries. It is vindicated to consider more focus on ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in research studies, sports-related pre-season screening, clinical examination, injury rehabilitation, and return-to-sports judgment.",1
Acute effects of three different stretching techniques on hamstring flexibility in professional football players,2023-06-19,2023,Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport,Baltic Journal of Health and Physical Activity,"Erkan Erol, Ramazan Yildiz, Ayse Yildiz, Fatih Emre Dogan, Bulent Elbasan","Introduction: Hamstring injuries are common in physically active people and athletes. Lack of hamstring flexibility is the one of the most important characteristics of hamstring injuries in athletes. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of three different stretching techniques on hamstring flexibility in professional football players. Materials and Methods: Fifty-five male football players between the ages of 18–20 years old were involved in the study. The participants were divided into 3 groups: static stretching, neuromobilization and Mulligan traction straight leg raise (TSLR), respectively. Each participant’s dominant lower extremity was assessed with a straight leg raise test (SLR) using a goniometer before and after the intervention. Results: There was a significant difference in the SLR range of motion before and after the intervention in all groups. There was no difference in the range of SLR between the groups at the beginning and at the end. However, the increase in the SLR range of motion was significantly higher in the Mulligan TSLR group. Conclusions: It was concluded that all 3 stretching techniques are effective in increasing hamstring flexibility in football players. However, the Mulligan TSLR technique could provide a greater increase in the range of motion than other techniques.",1
Genetic variants and anterior cruciate ligament rupture – elastin proteins gene and fibromodulin gene polymorphisms,2023-06-19,2023,Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport,Baltic Journal of Health and Physical Activity,"Ewelina Lulinska, Joanna Zelazny, Agnieszka Lulinska, Elzbieta Grzywacz, Aleksandra Stroinska-Pluta, Marek Sawczuk","Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common ligament injuries of the knee and often require reconstruction. The etiology of the molecular mechanisms of rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is poorly understood, and many external and internal factors have been associated with it, including genetics. This study aimed to investigate the association of sequence variants in the ELN and FMOD candidate genes with ACL ruptures based on the essential biological functions of these two proteoglycan-encoding genes in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and regulating fibrillogenesis. Material and Methods: The partici-pants consisted of 229 (164 male and 65 female) individuals with a surgically diagnosed ACL rup-ture (ACLR) who qualified for ligament reconstruction and 192 (107 male and 85 female) healthy participants with no history of ACL injury (CON group). All 229 participants in the ACLR group sustained injuries through non-contact mechanisms. The chi-square tests were used for association analysis of ELN rs2071307 and FMOD rs7543148 between the anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR) group and the control (CON) group. Results: It follows from the study that the tested group of athletes shows a statistically significantly more frequent AA genotype in the ELN rs2071307 gene polymorphism than the control group. However, looking at gender, one can observe that these are significantly more frequent. In the polymorphism of the FMOD rs7543148 gene, a significantly rarer TT genotype was observed in the study group compared to the control group and, similarly to the previous polymorphism, the TT genotype was significantly less frequent in the group of males com-pared to the control group. Conclusions: Genetic research in sports, especially concerning injuries connected to characteristic polymorphic variants of selected genes, is justified, particularly as regards gender-homogenous groups.",1
Match running performance profiles of amputee football players at the national level,2023-06-19,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Jarosław Muracki, Michał Nowak, Adam Kawczyński, Ana Filipa Silva, Filipe Manuel Clemente","Even though running performance and positional profiles in football are well described, amputee football (AF) has different characteristics of the movement, pitch dimensions, and time played. There is a gap in the scientific literature about positional profiles based on running performance in AF. This study aimed to investigate the differences between positions, the influence of the amputation level or defect of the lower limb (LD), the differences in running performance between halves, and the relationship with the final match result. Thirteen AF National Team players were monitored by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), tracking 24 official international matches for 17 months. Values of top speed, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, average distance per minute, sprint mean speed, GPS load per minute, inertial load per minute (Gs load/min), number of sprints per minute, and a number of impacts per minute were analyzed for defenders (DEF), midfielders (MID) and forwards (FOR). Additional factors analyzed were amputation level (below the knee, low amputation-LA or over the knee, high amputation-HA or defect of the lower limb-LD) and the match's final result. Midfielders had significantly higher running performance parameters compared to other positions (greater top speed than DEF (+ 0.3 m/s; p < 0.001) and FOR (+ 0.2 m/s; p = 0.045), greater peak acceleration and deceleration than DEF (+ 0.5 m/s",1
"Fatigue does not increase limb asymmetry or induce proximal joint power shift in habitual, multi-speed runners",2023-06-18,2023,Informa UK Limited,Journal of Sports Sciences,"Shayne Vial, Jodie Cochrane Wilkie, Mitchell Turner, Anthony J. Blazevich","During prolonged jogging, joint moment and work tend to decrease in the distal (ankle) joint but increase at proximal (hip/knee) joints as performance fatigue manifests, and such adaptations might be expected to occur in sprinting. Fatigue is also thought to increase inter-limb asymmetries, which is speculated to influence injury risk. However, the effects of fatigue on sprint running gait have been incompletely studied, so these hypotheses remain untested. Using statistical parametric mapping, we compared 3-D kinematics and ground reaction force production between the dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NDL) legs of 13 soccer players during both non-fatigued and fatigued sprint running. Contrary to the tested hypotheses, relative between-leg differences were greater in non-fatigued than fatigued sprinting. DL generated higher propulsive impulse due to increased ankle work, while NDL exhibited greater vertical impulse, potentially due to greater hip flexion prior to downward foot acceleration. Whilst few changes were detected in DL once fatigued, NDL shifted towards greater horizontal force production, largely resulting from an increase in plantar flexion (distal-joint) moments and power. After fatiguing running, inter-limb asymmetry was reduced and no distal-to-proximal shift in joint work was detected. These adaptations may attenuate decreases in running speed whilst minimising injury risk.",1
STRATEGIES TYPES ON PRECEDENT VERTICAL JUMP STRETCHING,2023-06-16,2023,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte,"Erickson Zacharias Barboza, Raquel Fleig, Iramar Baptistella do Nascimento","ABSTRACT Study design: identify a better strategy for static stretching (SS), dynamic stretching (DS), and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) concerning the performance of their applications in countermovement vertical jump (CVJ). A systematic literature review was conducted in May and June 2021 in the Pubmed/MEDLINE, Scopus, LILACS, SPORTDiscus, and Embase databases. The PRISMA-2020 checklist was used. The Cochrane handbook scale and the Downs and Black scale were used for risk of bias analysis. Seventeen studies were included for qualitative analysis. Motor Unit recruitment and its stimulation frequency favor neural factors and muscle strength performance during contraction. Detailed investigations are necessary on the neural factors that modify the reflex responses and motor control, considering the biological characteristics and plastic deformations. The SS is a negative predictor of vertical jump (VJ) performance. The improvements are reduced when the stretching time is longer than 60 seconds, and when associated with PNF, did not reveal significant results. Using the SS before the DS in short periods of 20 seconds and no more than 60 seconds in the pre-activity to the VJ is suggested. In short stretches, the ROM increased both in the knee and the hip, and the hamstring muscles, when in tension, are unfavorable in sports that frequently use the VJ. Therefore, PNF using the technique that involves a process of contracting and relaxing must be investigated in an isolated and specific way, advocating the antagonist group. Thus, decreasing antagonist strength may be favorable for height gain, although contemporary studies are needed to minimize lower stability and muscle control predictors.

Objectiveː The aim was to examine the relationship between Q angle and quadriceps muscle activation on dynamic balance position in women. Materials and Methodsː Forty women were included in the study. The muscle activation of the quadriceps during dynamic balance in a single leg stance was recorded. A tape measure was used to measure Q angle, surface electromyography was used to assess muscle activation, the Flamingo Balance Test was used to assess static balance, the TechnoBody PK 200WL computerized balance device was used to assess dynamic balance, and the Short Form Musculoskeletal Assessment was used to assess functionality. Resultsː There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the Q angle standing and supine position and vastus medialis muscle activation respectively, (r=0.35, p=0,02; r=0.40, p=0.01). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the perimeter length and Q angle in standing/supine position respectively, (r=0.33, p=0.04; r=0.32, p=0.04). Area gap percentage and Q angle standing (r=0.89, p=0.02), supine position Q angle values (r=0.63, p=0.03) were positively correlated. Conclusionː If vastus medialis is more strengthened, Q angle would be more normalized, so quadriceps muscle strengthening exercises are helpful for the normalization of the Q angle. Also, when the Q angle is normalized, a single leg balance would be revealed.",1

This pilot study was designed to examine if the use of GCs reduced concussion frequency, total symptom severity (TST), and days-until-symptom-resolution (DUSR) following a SC in collegiate football athletes. We hypothesized the GCs would not decrease SC frequency, TST, or DUSR. Methods Participants (N=14) in our cross-sectional study were Division I collegiate football athletes who were diagnosed with a SC (20.0±1.32 years old) who did (GC; n=3) or did not (NoGC; n=11) wear the GC. Only SCs that occurred to athletes required to wear the GC during practice were included in our analyses. As spring practice was cancelled during 2020 due to COVID-19, only fall practices were included in our analyses. The head coach remained consistent during the NoGC and GC study periods. Descriptive statistics were used to examine concussion frequency. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare TST and DUSR between groups. Also, [interquartile range] could not be calculated for the GC group due to the low number of SCs. Results On median, the number of SCs decreased from 4 to 1.5 per season from the NoGC to the GC period. On median DUSR decreased from 13.5[11] to 5[n/a] for the NoGC and GC groups, respectively (U=9.50,z=-.93,p=.35). TST also decreased from 16[27] to 6[n/a] in the NoGC and GC groups, respectively (U=5.0,z=-1.79,p=.07). Conclusions GCs may potentially reduce concussion frequency, TST, and DUSR, however, future research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm and extend our findings.",1

Soccer players with optimal running speed, agility and plyometric abilities are more likely to be selected for team participation, as they will have enhanced on-the-field performance. Various exercise and rehabilitation protocols exist to ensure optimal player performance, but none focus on the immediate effect of Kinesio tape (Kinesio Holding Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA) on the stabilising muscles of the lower limb to influence important basic soccer skills. A one-group pre-test–post-test quasi-experimental design was used. Thirty-three male university-level soccer players aged 18–35 years with no history of lower limb surgery were included. Baseline testing was performed using the vertical jump test, Modified Illinois Change of Direction test and a timed 50-metre sprint. After a rest period of 1–4 days, the participants were strapped with Kinesio tape and the post-test, using the same objective measures, was conducted.

Agreement between Force Platform and Smartphone Application-Derived Measures of Vertical Jump Height in Youth Grassroots Soccer Players,2023-06-13,2023,MDPI AG,Sports,"Jason Tallis, Rhys O. Morris, Michael J. Duncan, Emma L. J. Eyre, Lucas Guimaraes-Ferreira","Given the importance of vertical jump assessments as a performance benchmarking tool, the assessment of neuromuscular function and indicator of health status, accurate assessment is essential. This study compared countermovement jump (CMJ) height assessed using MyJump2 (JHMJ) to force-platform-derived jump height calculated from time in the air (JHTIA) and take-off velocity (JHTOV) in youth grassroots soccer players. Thirty participants (Age: 8.7 ± 0.42 yrs; 9 females) completed bilateral CMJs on force platforms whilst jump height was simultaneously evaluated using MyJump2. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Standard error of measurement (SEM), coefficient of variance (CV) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare performance of MyJump2 to force-platform-derived measures of CMJ height. The median jump height was 15.5 cm. Despite a high level of agreement between JHTIA and JHTOV (ICC = 0.955), CV (6.6%), mean bias (1.33 ± 1.62 cm) and 95% limits of agreement (LoA -1.85-4.51 cm) were greater than in other comparisons. JHMJ performed marginally better than JHTIA when compared to JHTOV (ICC = 0.971; 95% CI's = 0.956-0.981; SEM = 0.3 cm; CV = 5.7%; mean bias = 0.36 ± 1.61 cm; LoA = -3.52-2.80 cm). Irrespective of method, jump height did not differ between males and females (p > 0.381; r < 0.093), and the comparison between assessment tools was not affected by sex. Given low jump heights achieved in youth, JHTIA and JHMJ should be used with caution. JHTOV should be used to guarantee accuracy in the calculation of jump height.",1

Application of a Structured Training Plan on Different-Length Microcycles in Soccer—Internal and External Load Analysis between Training Weeks and Games,2023-06-08,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Lazaros Vardakis, Yiannis Michailidis, Panagiotis Topalidis, Charalambos Zelenitsas, Athanasios Mandroukas, Ioannis Gissis, Kosmas Christoulas, George Mavrommatis, Thomas Metaxas","The aim of this study was to apply a training plan to four different-length microcycles (MIC) in soccer and analyze (a) the load within the training weeks and (b) the short-term effect on the matches that were played at the end of each microcycle. An intervention training program applied to microcycles of five, six, seven and nine days during two seasons of the Cypriot Fist Division. The GPS technology and subjective (wellness, RPE) assessments were used to monitor the load throughout trainings and games. In weekly external load, there were differences between the four microcycles, with a lower load in MIC5 for all the parameters and higher on MIC9 in the most of them (p &lt; 0.05). In RPE, MIC9 (229 ± 60 arbitrary units (au)) differed significantly from MIC5 (229 ± 60 au, p &lt; 0.001), MIC6 (281 ± 67 au; p &lt; 0.001) and MIC7 (297 ± 48 au, p = 0.009). MIC5 also differed from MIC6 (p = 0.001) and MIC7 (p &lt; 0.001).

No differences were found for wellness and perceived exertion. It is important for performance coaches to adapt the training load to the length of the microcycle, applying a lower load to short training weeks and manage the load fluctuation on long training weeks in terms of volume, intensity and recovery. In our study, the results confirmed that this strategy could result in similar performance in the games, regardless of microcycle length.",1
Where are We Headed? Evidence to Inform Future Football Heading Guidelines,2023-06-07,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Kerry Peek, Rob Duffield, Ross Cairns, Mark Jones, Tim Meyer, Alan McCall, Vincent Oxenham","Abstract Given the scientific and public concern regarding the short-, medium- and long-term consequences of heading on brain health, being proactive about developing and implementing guidelines that help reduce the burden (volume, impact magnitude and injury risk) of heading in young and beginner players appears justified. This narrative review explores the evidence underpinning strategies that could be incorporated into future heading guidelines to reduce heading burden in players across all levels of football. A four-step search strategy was utilised to identify all data-based papers related to heading in football. Eligibility criteria for inclusion were: (1) original data, (2) study population included football players, (3) outcome measures included one or more of the following: number of headers, measurement of head acceleration during heading, or head/brain injury incidence, and (4) published in English or English translation available. In total, 58 papers were included that outlined strategies based on (1) game or team development, (2) player skill development and (3) equipment. In particular, greater emphasis existed for small-sided games (particularly in young players) where fewer headers are observed when compared with the conventional 11 versus 11 game, as well as reducing headers from goal kicks and corners. Evidence also existed for developing a heading coaching framework that focusses on technical proficiency as well as neuromuscular neck exercises integrated into general injury reduction exercise programs, enforcement of rules related to deliberate head contact and using lower-pressure match and training balls. To mitigate potential risks of heading on brain health, a number of pragmatic strategies have been examined in scientific studies and may be considered as part of future heading guidelines.",1
Foot rotation and pelvic angle correlate with knee abduction moment during 180° lateral cut in football players,2023-06-07,2023,Elsevier BV,The Knee,"Stefano Di Paolo, Alberto Grassi, Laura Bragonzoni, Stefano Zaffagnini, Francesco Della Villa","Lateral movements are challenging for 2D video-analysis and are therefore often omitted in functional tests for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury risk assessment. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between frontal and transverse plane angles obtained from 2D video-analysis and knee abduction moment (KAM) from gold standard 3D motion capture in a 180° lateral cut task. The hypothesis was that 2D angles other than the knee joint effectively explain variations in KAM.Thirty-four healthy football players (age 22.8 ± 4.1 years) performed a series of 180° lateral cut (lateral shuffles) tasks. The peak KAM was collected through a 3D motion capture system. A 2D video-analysis movement assessment identified frontal and transverse plane joint kinematics: foot projection angle (FPA), Frontal Plane Knee Projection Angle (FPKPA), Pelvis tilt angle (PA), and Trunk tilt angle (TA). A forward stepwise regression model was used to assess significant 2D predictors of KAM (p < 0.05).FPA and PA were the only significant predictors (R2-ajdusted = 9.2%, p < 0.001), with external foot rotation and contralateral pelvic drop associated with higher KAM. Based on the regression model, the ""High FPA & PA group"" was defined and showed higher KAM than the rest of the cohort (p = 0.012, ES = 0.71).The external foot rotation and the contralateral pelvic drop from 2D video-analysis were associated with higher peak KAM during the 180° lateral cut. A qualitative assessment of the 180° lateral cut could offer precious insights on ACL injury risk mitigation.Descriptive Laboratory Study.",1
Correction of systematic errors in electronic performance and tracking systems,2023-06-07,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"Marc Schmid, Martin Lames","Abstract Electronic performance and tracking systems are becoming a standard in many sports to automate data collection and gather more profound insights into performance and game dynamics. In large soccer clubs and federations, the problem is that different electronic performance and tracking systems report different kinematic parameters and performance indicators, which should be the same. Furthermore, a drawback in recent validation studies is the subdivision of speed and acceleration zones in validating the systems, as we show that the kinematic parameters are interdependent. We propose a new method to classify multidimensional validation outputs with a clustering approach. Additionally, we offer a data-driven strategy to reduce errors between distinct systems when data from different electronic performance and tracking systems are compared and show the method’s effectiveness with data collected in a validation study. This error reduction strategy can be applied to correct errors when no validation data is available.",1
"Sport-related concussion and bodychecking in children and youth: Evaluation, management, and policy implications",2023-06-06,2023,Oxford University Press (OUP),Paediatrics &amp; Child Health,"Kristian Goulet, Suzanne Beno","Abstract Concussions are a common injury both within and outside sport and recreational settings, and they remain a serious concern for children and youth. Any young person suspected of sustaining a concussion should be medically evaluated as soon as possible, and when the injury occurs during sport, the individual must be removed from play immediately to avoid secondary injury. A brief initial period of physical and cognitive rest is followed by supervised, stepwise return-to-learn and return-to-play protocols. All individuals involved in child and youth sports and recreation must be able to recognize risk for, and signs and symptoms of, concussion. They must also ensure that any participant suspected of sustaining a concussion is properly evaluated and managed by qualified medical personnel. Evolving data and literature have strengthened both our pathophysiological understanding of concussion and guidance for clinical management, especially related to acute care, persistent symptoms, and prevention. This statement also re-examines the relationship between bodychecking in hockey and injury rates, and advocates for a change in policy in youth hockey.",1
The Effects of the 11+ Dance Neuromuscular Program on Jump Height and Lower Extremity Biomechanics in Female Adolescent Dancers: A Non-Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,2023-06-06,2023,SAGE Publications,Journal of Dance Medicine &amp; Science,"Karen J. Sudds, Philipp Maurus, Sandro R. Nigg, Matthew A. Wyon, Nico Kolokythas","Introduction: Neuromuscular warm-up programs, such as FIFA 11+ were developed as early as 2006. These programs have been effective in reducing the risk of injury in female athletes by decreasing the moments surrounding the knee and improving neuromuscular control during static and dynamic movements such as jumping and landing. In addition, they have been effective for improving jump height in soccer, volleyball, and basketball. Methods: The effects of the 11+ Dance, a dance-specific neuromuscular warm-up program, was examined on jump height and lower extremity biomechanics during bilateral and single leg countermovement jumps in recreational dancers. Twenty female adolescents from 2 dance schools participated in this 2-centered 8-week controlled non-randomized trial. The intervention group (IG) performed the 11+ Dance program 3×/week for 8-weeks during the first 30-minute of their regularly scheduled dance classes. The control group (CG) continued with their regular dance classes routine. Ground reaction force and motion capture data were used to assess jump height and lower extremity biomechanics pre and post intervention. Results: Both groups statistically increased their jump height (CG: Z = 1.89-2.45, P ≤ .0167; IG: Z = 2.18-2.76, P ≤ .0167). However, no statistical between group differences were observed ( Z = 0.38-1.22, P &gt; .05). During takeoff, the IG statistically reduced peak knee extension moments ( t(18) = -3.04 to -3.77, P ≤ .0167) while increasing peak hip extension moments ( t(18) = 2.16-2.79, P ≤ .05) and peak hip flexion angles ( t(18) = 2.68-3.72, P ≤ .0167) compared to the CG. The IG also increased the hip flexion angles compared to the CG during landing ( t(18) = 2.78-5.13, P ≤ .0167) while no systematic differences were observed in all other variables of lower extremity biomechanics. Conclusion: The reduced joint load at the knee observed during takeoff needs further investigation. Neuromuscular training, such as the 11+ Dance, is supported by numerous quality research. Due to its simplicity, the 11+ Dance may be feasible and beneficial to complement regular warm-ups in recreational dance practice.",1
Foot sens - foot pressure monitoring systems,2023-06-06,2023,The Scientific Temper,The Scientific Temper,"Rasheedha A, Santhosh B, Archana N, Sandhiya A","Foot plantar strain is the tension field that acts between the foot and the help surface during regular locomotion and exercises. Data from such strains is significant in gait analysis and posture research for diagnosing lower appendage issues, footwear configuration, sport biomechanics, injury anticipation and give important understanding on the assortment of biomechanical and neurological problems, with treatment and prevention of wounds brought about by high foot pressure.

The Effects of 5 km Interval Running on the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain and Biomechanical Characteristic of the Knee Joint: Simulation and Principal Component Analysis,2023-06-02,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Enze Shao, Qichang Mei, Tongjun Ye, Bálint Kovács, Julien S. Baker, Wei Liu, Yaodong Gu","Interval running methodologies simulate competition and training conditions, with the aim of enhancing an athletes’ ability to cope with constant deceleration, acceleration, and sudden changes in direction, as associated athletic and performance challenges. Fifteen male athletes were recruited in this study, in which the anterior cruciate ligament was modeled as a nonlinear elastic passive soft tissue in OpenSim 4.2. Participants completed 5 km interval running training on a treadmill. Before and after the interval running, kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography activity of the lower leg during the cutting maneuvers were collected simultaneously. After running training, the anterior cruciate ligament strain demonstrated a decreasing trend when performing unexpected cutting maneuvers. Principal component analysis showed significant differences in knee moments during abduction-adduction; knee angles in flexion-extension, external-internal rotation, and abduction-adduction, as well as knee contact forces in the sagittal and coronal planes. The findings of the study highlight that athletes generate greater adduction moment at the onset of the cut, followed by greater abduction moment towards the end of the cut, which may have a substantial impact on the anterior cruciate ligament loading. Furthermore, athletes need to be mindful of changes in coronal plane contact forces.",1
Prevention strategies and modifiable risk factors for sport-related concussions and head impacts: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2023-06-01,2023,BMJ,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Paul H Eliason, Jean-Michel Galarneau, Ash T Kolstad, M Patrick Pankow, Stephen W West, Stuart Bailey, Lauren Miutz, Amanda Marie Black, Steven P Broglio, Gavin A Davis, Brent E Hagel, Jonathan D Smirl, Keith A Stokes, Michael Takagi, Ross Tucker, Nick Webborn, Roger Zemek, Alix Hayden, Kathryn J Schneider, Carolyn A Emery","Objectives To evaluate prevention strategies, their unintended consequences and modifiable risk factors for sport-related concussion (SRC) and/or head impact risk.

Data sources Eight databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane (Systematic Review and Controlled Trails Registry), SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, ERIC0 were searched in October 2019 and updated in March 2022, and references searched from any identified systematic review. Eligibility criteria Study inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) original data human research studies, (2) investigated SRC or head impacts, (3) evaluated an SRC prevention intervention, unintended consequence or modifiable risk factor, (4) participants competing in any sport, (5) analytic study design, (6) systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included to identify original data manuscripts in reference search and (7) peer-reviewed. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) review articles, pre-experimental, ecological, case series or case studies and (2) not written in English. Results In total, 220 studies were eligible for inclusion and 192 studies were included in the results based on methodological criteria as assessed through the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network high (‘++’) or acceptable (‘+’) quality. Evidence was available examining protective gear (eg, helmets, headgear, mouthguards) (n=39), policy and rule changes (n=38), training strategies (n=34), SRC management strategies (n=12), unintended consequences (n=5) and modifiable risk factors (n=64). Meta-analyses demonstrated a protective effect of mouthguards in collision sports (incidence rate ratio, IRR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.89). Policy disallowing bodychecking in child and adolescent ice hockey was associated with a 58% lower concussion rate compared with bodychecking leagues (IRR 0.42; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.53), and evidence supports no unintended injury consequences of policy disallowing bodychecking. In American football, strategies limiting contact in practices were associated with a 64% lower practice-related concussion rate (IRR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.80). Some evidence also supports up to 60% lower concussion rates with implementation of a neuromuscular training warm-up programme in rugby. More research examining potentially modifiable risk factors (eg, neck strength, optimal tackle technique) are needed to inform concussion prevention strategies. Conclusions Policy and rule modifications, personal protective equipment, and neuromuscular training strategies may help to prevent SRC. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019152982.",1
SportsPose - A Dynamic 3D sports pose dataset,2023-06-01,2023,IEEE,2023 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),"Christian Keilstrup Ingwersen, Christian Møller Mikkelstrup, Janus Nørtoft Jensen, Morten Rieger Hannemose, Anders Bjorholm Dahl","Accurate 3D human pose estimation is essential for sports analytics, coaching, and injury prevention. However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic. The dataset with accompanying code can be downloaded from our website. We hope that SportsPose will allow researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more effective models for the analysis of sports performance and injury prevention. With its realistic and diverse dataset, SportsPose provides a valuable resource for advancing the state-of-the-art in pose estimation in sports.",1
Training interventions to reduce the risk of injury to the lower extremity joints during landing movements in adult athletes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2023-06-01,2023,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Chantal Bathe, Lena Fennen, Theresa Heering, Alexander Greif, Rosemary Dubbeldam","Aim of this systematic review was to summarise training interventions designed to reduce biomechanical risk factors associated with increased risk of lower extremity landing injuries and to evaluate their practical implications in amateur sports.Systematic review and meta-analysis.MEDLINE, Scopus and SPORTDiscus.Training intervention(s) aimed at reducing biomechanical risk factors and/or injury rates included the following: (1) prospective or (non-)randomised controlled study design; (2) risk factors that were measured with valid two-dimensional or three-dimensional motion analysis systems or Landing Error Scoring System during jump landings. In addition, meta-analyses were performed, and the risk of bias was assessed.Thirty-one studies met all inclusion criteria, capturing 11 different training interventions (eg, feedback and plyometrics) and 974 participants. A significantly medium effect of technique training (both instruction and feedback) and dynamic strengthening (ie, plyometrics with/without strengthening) on knee flexion angle (g=0.77; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.21) was shown. Only one-third of the studies had training interventions that required minimal training setup and additional coaching educations.This systematic review highlights that amateur coaches can decrease relevant biomechanical risk factors by means of minimal training setup, for example, instructing to focus on a soft landing, even within only one training session of simple technique training. The meta-analysis emphasises implementing technique training as stand-alone or combined with dynamic strengthening into amateur sport training routine.",1
Risk factors and associated factors for calcaneal apophysitis (Sever’s disease): a systematic review,2023-06-01,2023,BMJ,BMJ Open,"Pilar Nieto-Gil, Javier Marco-Lledó, Jonatan García-Campos, María Ruiz-Muñoz, Gabriel Gijon-Nogueron, Laura Ramos-Petersen","Objectives The aim of this review was to identify the potential intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors (RFs), associated factors (AFs) and consequences of developing calcaneal apophysitis (CA). Design Systematic review. Data sources Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science and Evidence, searched from inception to April 2021. Eligibility criteria We included cohort, case–control and cross-sectional studies that were conducted in patients younger than 18 years who were exposed to RFs or who presented with factors associated with developing CA. Studies in languages other than English or Spanish were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers worked independently to evaluate the risk of bias of included studies. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (adapted version) was used. Results A total of 736 studies were identified and 11 observational studies fully met the inclusion criteria, including 1265 participants with a mean age of 10.72 years. Four studies identified extrinsic factors, 10 identified intrinsic factors and three identified both. The extrinsic and intrinsic RFs, AFs and consequences of CA include limitation of ankle dorsiflexion, foot alignment, stiffness and mobility of the midfoot, plantar pressures and ground reaction force, body mass index, age, gender, presence of other osteochondroses and practice of sport. The risk of bias varied, being either moderate or low. Conclusions Regarding the factors and consequences associated with CA (Sever’s disease), ankle dorsiflexion limitation is the most frequent intrinsic factor studied, followed by peak plantar pressures and foot malalignment. However, disagreements between the investigators of the included studies were found; in some cases, there is a lack of unanimity between different studies as to which factors are considered to be RFs, AFs and consequences.

This prospective longitudinal cohort study aims to describe heading exposure in children's and youth football over two seasons using standardized video analysis.All matches and training sessions of a male Under-11 (n = 29), Under-15 (n = 28), Under-19 (n = 38), and female Under-17 (n = 39) team were videotaped during the seasons 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Heading frequencies and characteristics were analyzed. Individual heading exposure is presented as average incidence rates (IR) per 1000 match/training hours.In 275 matches and 673 training sessions, 22 921 headers were observed. Heading IR per player in matches was 1256 (Under-11 m), 1608 (Under-15 m), 1050 (Under-17 f), and 1966 (Under-19 m). In training sessions, IR per player was 739 (Under-11 m), 2206 (Under-15 m), 1661 (Under-17 f), and 1419 (Under-19 m). Five Under-15 males headed the ball five to eight times per training on average. Most headers were performed without heading duels. Flight distance was predominantly 5-20 m (54%) in matches and <5 m (65%) in training. While head impact location most frequently was at frontal areas, one-third of all headers in Under-11 in matches hit temporal, parietal, and occipital parts of the head.Heading incidence was low in the youngest age group, whereas (predominantly five) Under-15 males showed very high heading exposures in training. In assessment and regulation of heading burden, training sessions and individual heading behavior should specifically be addressed. Recommendations for heading the ball in practice should account for individual and age-related differences.",1

Return to Sport After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Among Physically Active Adults,2023-06-01,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Abdulrahman  J Korkoman, Bader Aljadaan, Anas Alqarni, Abdullah  A Alshomrany, Abdullah  N Almuawi, Abdullah  F Alhalafi, Abdulmohsen N Alshahrani, Masoud M Alqahtani, Kady Althunayan","An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of athletes' most severe and frequent knee ligament injuries. The primary function of the ACL is preventing excessive anterior tibial translation, and it limits varus/valgus stress when the knee is in full extension and rotatory movements. Returning to sport after an ACL injury is a crucial aim of ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Multiple factors, modifiable and nonmodifiable, can influence the time to return to sport. This study aimed to discuss factors that affect optimal return-to-play (RTP) timing, symptom recurrence, and long-term consequences of an ACL injury. This is a cross-sectional study involving patients who are following in orthopedic surgery outpatient clinics with a history of ACLR at least six months before surgery and not beyond six years after surgery. Participants received a survey about their sociodemographic data, details of the type and site of injury, and ACL return to sport before and after reconstruction scale. Full data description and testing of dependent variables against participant variables using two-sided tests were performed with a significance level of P ≤ 0.05. The study involved 129 participants, of which the majority were male Bisha residents aged 20 to 29 years. The study found that the right leg was the most commonly injured, with the dominant leg being the most frequently reconstructed due to problems with knee function. Before the injury, most participants ran, cut (quick changes of direction during running), decelerated, and pivoted activities four or more times per month. However, physical activities notably reduced after ACLR. Age and body mass index (BMI) showed statistical significance related to the likelihood of returning to physical activities. The study found a significant reduction in the frequency of activities such as cutting, deceleration, and running after ACLR. Age was identified as a predictor affecting the likelihood of returning to the sport, with older patients being less likely to return than younger ones.",1

Steinfeldt, Keisuke Kawata","Importance Consequences of subconcussive head impacts have been recognized, yet most studies to date have included small samples from a single site, used a unimodal approach, and lacked repeated testing. Objective To examine time-course changes in clinical (near point of convergence [NPC]) and brain-injury blood biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 [UCH-L1], and neurofilament light [NF-L]) in adolescent football players and to test whether changes in the outcomes were associated with playing position, impact kinematics, and/or brain tissue strain. Design, Setting, and Participants This multisite, prospective cohort study included male high school football players aged 13 to 18 years at 4 high schools in the Midwest during the 2021 high school football season (preseason [July] and August 2 to November 19). Exposure A single football season. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were NPC (a clinical oculomotor test) and serum levels of GFAP, UCH-L1, and NF-L. Participants’ head impact exposure (frequency and peak linear and rotational accelerations) was tracked using instrumented mouthguards, and maximum principal strain was computed to reflect brain tissue strain. Players’ neurological function was assessed at 5 time points (preseason, post–training camp, 2 in season, and postseason). Results Ninety-nine male players contributed to the time-course analysis (mean [SD] age, 15.8 [1.1] years), but data from 6 players (6.1%) were excluded from the association analysis due to issues related to mouthguards. Thus, 93 players yielded 9498 head impacts in a season (mean [SD], 102 [113] impacts per player). There were time-course elevations in NPC and GFAP, UCH-L1, and NF-L levels. Compared with baseline, the NPC exhibited a significant elevation over time and peaked at postseason (2.21 cm; 95% CI, 1.80-2.63 cm; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 increased by 25.6 pg/mL (95% CI, 17.6-33.6 pg/mL; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) and 188.5 pg/mL (95% CI, 145.6-231.4 pg/mL; P &amp;amp;lt; .001), respectively, later in the season. Levels of NF-L were elevated after the training camp (0.78 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.14-1.41 pg/mL; P = .011) and midseason (0.55 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.13-0.99 pg/mL; P = .006) but normalized by the end of the season. Changes in UCH-L1 levels were associated with maximum principal strain later in the season (0.052 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.015-0.088 pg/mL; P = .007) and postseason (0.069 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.031-0.106 pg/mL; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Conclusions and Relevance The study data suggest that adolescent football players exhibited impairments in oculomotor function and elevations in blood biomarker levels associated with astrocyte activation and neuronal injury throughout a season. Several years of follow-up are needed to examine the long-term effects of subconcussive head impacts in adolescent football players.",1

The objectives were to provide guidance on which genetic markers could potentially be used as part of future practice in soccer and to provide direction for future research in this area. The most compelling evidence identified six genetic polymorphisms to be associated with soccer athlete status (ACE I/D; ACTN3 rs1815739; AGT rs699; MCT1 rs1049434; NOS3 rs2070744; PPARA rs4253778), six with physical performance (ACTN3 rs1815739; AMPD1 rs17602729; BDNF rs6265; COL2A1 rs2070739; COL5A1 rs12722; NOS3 rs2070744), and seven with injury risk (ACTN3 rs1815739; CCL2 rs2857656; COL1A1 rs1800012; COL5A1 rs12722; EMILIN1 rs2289360; IL6 rs1800795; MMP3 rs679620). As well as replication by independent groups, large-scale genome-wide association studies are required to identify new genetic markers. Future research should also investigate the physiological mechanisms associating these polymorphisms with specific phenotypes. Further, researchers should investigate the above associations in female and non-Caucasian soccer players, as almost all published studies have recruited male participants of European ancestry. Only after robust, independently replicated genetic data have been generated, can genetic testing be considered an additional tool to potentially inform future practice in soccer.",1

Noncontact ACL injuries have been associated with slower reaction time, but whether this association exists for patients with contact ACL injuries is unknown. Exploring differences in VMRT among individuals with contact versus noncontact ACL injuries may provide a more comprehensive understanding of modifiable risk factors. Objective To compare lower extremity VMRT (LEVMRT) in individuals with contact or noncontact ACL injuries after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 36 participants with primary, unilateral ACLR completed an LEVMRT assessment (contact ACL injury = 20 [56%], noncontact ACL injury = 16 [44%]). Main Outcome Measure(s) The LEVMRT was assessed bilaterally and collected using a series of wireless light discs deactivated by individuals with their feet. The ACLR-active LEVMRT (ie, ACLR limb is deactivating lights) and ACLR-stable LEVMRT were compared using separate analyses of covariance to determine the association with contact or noncontact injury using time since surgery as a covariate. Results After controlling for time since surgery, a difference and large effect size between groups was found for the ACLR-stable LEVMRT (P = .010; η2 = 0.250) but not for the ACLR-active (P = .340; η2 = 0.065) condition. The contact group exhibited slower ACLR-stable LEVMRT (521.7 ± 59.3 milliseconds) than the noncontact group (483.4 ± 83.9 milliseconds). Conclusions Individuals with contact ACL injury demonstrated a slower LEVMRT while their ACLR limb was stabilizing. The group differences during the ACLR-stable LEVMRT task might indicate deficits in perceptual-motor function when the surgical limb maintains postural control during a reaction time task. After ACLR, individuals with contact injuries may need additional motor learning interventions to enhance perceptual-motor functioning.",1

Hakami, Anwar Darraj","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a common medical condition that entails a stretch or sprain of the ACL, which is present in the knee joint. The incidence of ACL injury in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is estimated to be 31.4%. Prevention training programs (PTPs) can be used to reduce ACL injuries sustained during physical activity, as they primarily focus on improving strength, balance, and lower limb biomechanics and reducing landing impact. This study aimed to assess Saudi athletes' awareness of ACL injury PTPs.A cross-sectional survey in the form of a self-administered questionnaire in the Arabic language was carried out from 22 December 2022 to 7 March 2023 and included 1169 Saudi athletes. Statistical analyses were performed on the collected data using frequency and percentages. Binary logistic regression was used for the adjusted analysis and determining associations between athletes playing high- and low-risk sports.Overall, 52% of participants were female athletes, and 48% were male athletes. The western region of the country had the highest response rate (28.9%). The most common sport played was football at 36.6%. Most participants (70.97%) reported that their information on ACL injury was taken by their coaches. When assessing whether participants were familiar with the concept of an ACL injury PTP, the majority of the participants answered no, representing 971 (662 high-risk, 309 low-risk), compared to those who answered yes, representing only 198 (167 high-risk, 31 low-risk), with a statistically significant difference (adjusted OR: 2.106; 95% confidence interval: 1.544-2.873; p-value < 0.001).In general, the level of awareness of ACL injury PTPs among Saudi athletes was poor.",1
Effects of Game-Specific Demands on Accelerations during Change of Direction Movements: Analysis of Youth Female Soccer,2023-05-29,2023,MDPI AG,Biomechanics,"Aki-Matti Alanen, Lauren C. Benson, Matthew J. Jordan, Reed Ferber, Kati Pasanen","The aim of this study was to assess center of mass (COM) acceleration and movement during change of direction (COD) maneuvers during a competitive soccer game to elucidate situation-specific demands of COD performance. This information can assist in developing soccer-specific tests and training methods. Fifteen elite-level female youth soccer players were tracked for one game with inertial measurement units (IMU) attached to the lower back. COD movements in combination with situational patterns were identified using high-speed video. LASSO regression was used to identify the most important predictors associated with higher vertical peak accelerations (PAv) of the COM during COD movements. COD angle, running speed, contact, and challenge from the opposition were identified as important features related to higher PAv. This study adds to the literature on the demands of COD performance in soccer match-play. The unique approach with game-specific situational data from female youth players provides increased insight into the game-demands of COD and agility performance. PAv in games was higher with larger COD angles, increased running speed, or with contact when the player was challenged by the opposition. A larger study including more games is warranted to increase confidence in using these variables as a basis for training or testing agility.",1
Analyzing Shooting Measurements in Football: An Exhaustive Review and Novel Findings,2023-05-29,2023,Sciencedomain International,Asian Journal of Education and Social Studies,"M. Said Zainuddin, Arifuddin Usman, Muhammad Kamal, Akbar Sudirman","This article comprehensively reviews football shooting analysis, discussing the most recent techniques and tools and proposing new ways to investigate shooting performance. The analysis demonstrates that measuring shooting parameters using various tools and techniques is possible precisely. However, most of these methods have limitations, such as expensive apparatus, a lack of real-time feedback, or the need for manual data processing. Wearable sensors and data integration are proposed as solutions for overcoming these obstacles. The review highlights the significance of shooting analysis in football and the potential of new technologies to enhance this process, thereby providing coaches and players with valuable insights. Validating these approaches and exploring their maximum potential in football analysis requires additional research.&#x0D; Moreover, the approaches proposed in this study have the potential to increase the performance of individual players and team tactics. Coaches and players can better understand the team's strengths and weaknesses by combining shooting data with other performance metrics, such as player movement and team tactics. It can improve game-time decision-making and ultimately enhance the team's overall performance. The ability to monitor player fatigue and injury risk is another potential advantage of using wearable sensors and real-time feedback in shooting analysis. By consistently measuring shooting parameters, coaches and medical personnel can determine when a player's shooting technique is compromised due to fatigue or injury. Additional research is required to validate and realize these proposed approaches' potential thoroughly.",1

Development of a Standardised System to Classify Injury-Inciting Circumstances in Football: the Football Injury Inciting Circumstances Classification System (FIICCS),2023-05-26,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Francesco Aiello, Alan McCall, Susan J. Brown, Andreas Serner, Lauren V. Fortington, Suzanne Afra Elisabeth Huurman, Colin Lewin, Masashi Nagao, James O’Brien, Anastasia Panossian, Ricard Pruna, Guilherme Passos Ramos, Matthew Whalan, Franco M. Impellizzeri","A comprehensive examination of the sport-specific activities and circumstances being performed at the time of injury is important to hypothesise mechanisms, develop prevention strategies and inform future investigations. Results reported in the literature are inconsistent because inciting activities are reported using different classifications. Hence the aim was to develop a standardised system for the reporting of inciting circumstances.The system was developed using a modified Nominal Group Technique. The initial panel included 12 sports practitioners and researchers from four continents with respectively ≥ 5 years of experience working in professional football and/or conducting injury research. The process consisted of six phases: idea generation, two surveys, one online meeting and two confirmations. For answers to the closed questions, consensus was deemed achieved if ≥ 70% of respondents agreed. Open-ended answers were qualitatively analysed and then introduced in subsequent phases.Ten panellists completed the study. The risk of attrition bias was low. The developed system includes a comprehensive range of inciting circumstances across five domains: contact type, ball situation, physical activity, session details, contextual information. The system also distinguishes between a core set (essential reporting) and an optional set. The panel deemed all the domains to be important and easy to use both in football and in research environments.A system to classify inciting circumstances in football was developed. Given the extent of reporting inconsistency of inciting circumstances in the available literature, this can be used while further studies evaluate its reliability.",1
"The Acute Demands of Repeated-Sprint Training on Physiological, Neuromuscular, Perceptual and Performance Outcomes in Team Sport Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",2023-05-24,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Fraser Thurlow, Jonathon Weakley, Andrew D. Townshend, Ryan G. Timmins, Matthew Morrison, Shaun J. McLaren","Repeated-sprint training (RST) involves maximal-effort, short-duration sprints (≤ 10 s) interspersed with brief recovery periods (≤ 60 s). Knowledge about the acute demands of RST and the influence of programming variables has implications for training prescription.To investigate the physiological, neuromuscular, perceptual and performance demands of RST, while also examining the moderating effects of programming variables (sprint modality, number of repetitions per set, sprint repetition distance, inter-repetition rest modality and inter-repetition rest duration) on these outcomes.The databases Pubmed, SPORTDiscus, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched for original research articles investigating overground running RST in team sport athletes ≥ 16 years. Eligible data were analysed using multi-level mixed effects meta-analysis, with meta-regression performed on outcomes with ~ 50 samples (10 per moderator) to examine the influence of programming factors. Effects were evaluated based on coverage of their confidence (compatibility) limits (CL) against elected thresholds of practical importance.From 908 data samples nested within 176 studies eligible for meta-analysis, the pooled effects (± 90% CL) of RST were as follows: average heart rate (HRavg) of 163 ± 9 bpm, peak heart rate (HRpeak) of 182 ± 3 bpm, average oxygen consumption of 42.4 ± 10.1 mL·kg-1·min-1, end-set blood lactate concentration (B[La]) of 10.7 ± 0.6 mmol·L-1, deciMax session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE) of 6.5 ± 0.5 au, average sprint time (Savg) of 5.57 ± 0.26 s, best sprint time (Sbest) of 5.52 ± 0.27 s and percentage sprint decrement (Sdec) of 5.0 ± 0.3%. When compared with a reference protocol of 6 × 30 m straight-line sprints with 20 s passive inter-repetition rest, shuttle-based sprints were associated with a substantial increase in repetition time (Savg: 1.42 ± 0.11 s, Sbest: 1.55 ± 0.13 s), whereas the effect on sRPE was trivial (0.6 ± 0.9 au). Performing two more repetitions per set had a trivial effect on HRpeak (0.8 ± 1.0 bpm), B[La] (0.3 ± 0.2 mmol·L-1), sRPE (0.2 ± 0.2 au), Savg (0.01 ± 0.03) and Sdec (0.4; ± 0.2%). Sprinting 10 m further per repetition was associated with a substantial increase in B[La] (2.7; ± 0.7 mmol·L-1) and Sdec (1.7 ± 0.4%), whereas the effect on sRPE was trivial (0.7 ± 0.6). Resting for 10 s longer between repetitions was associated with a substantial reduction in B[La] (-1.1 ± 0.5 mmol·L-1), Savg (-0.09 ± 0.06 s) and Sdec (-1.4 ± 0.4%), while the effects on HRpeak (-0.7 ± 1.8 bpm) and sRPE (-0.5 ± 0.5 au) were trivial. All other moderating effects were compatible with both trivial and substantial effects [i.e. equal coverage of the confidence interval (CI) across a trivial and a substantial region in only one direction], or inconclusive (i.e. the CI spanned across substantial and trivial regions in both positive and negative directions).The physiological, neuromuscular, perceptual and performance demands of RST are substantial, with some of these outcomes moderated by the manipulation of programming variables. To amplify physiological demands and performance decrement, longer sprint distances (> 30 m) and shorter, inter-repetition rest (≤ 20 s) are recommended. Alternatively, to mitigate fatigue and enhance acute sprint performance, shorter sprint distances (e.g. 15-25 m) with longer, passive inter-repetition rest (≥ 30 s) are recommended.",1
"Subsequent Jumping Increases the Knee and Hip Abduction Moment, Trunk Lateral Tilt, and Trunk Rotation Motion During Single-Leg Landing in Female Individuals",2023-05-24,2023,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Masato Chijimatsu, Tomoya Ishida, Masanori Yamanaka, Shohei Taniguchi, Ryo Ueno, Ryohei Ikuta, Mina Samukawa, Takumi Ino, Satoshi Kasahara, Harukazu Tohyama","Single-leg landings with or without subsequent jumping are frequently used to evaluate landing biomechanics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of subsequent jumping on the external knee abduction moment and trunk and hip biomechanics during single-leg landing. Thirty young adult female participants performed a single-leg drop vertical jumping (SDVJ; landing with subsequent jumping) and single-leg drop landing (SDL; landing without subsequent jumping). Trunk, hip, and knee biomechanics were evaluated using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system. The peak knee abduction moment was significantly larger during SDVJ than during SDL (SDVJ 0.08 [0.10] N·m·kg-1·m-1, SDL 0.05 [0.10] N·m·kg-1·m-1, P = .002). The trunk lateral tilt and rotation angles toward the support-leg side and external hip abduction moment were significantly larger during SDVJ than during SDL (P < .05). The difference in the peak hip abduction moment between SDVJ and SDL predicted the difference in the peak knee abduction moment (P = .003, R2 = .252). Landing tasks with subsequent jumping would have advantages for evaluating trunk and hip control as well as knee abduction moment. In particular, evaluating hip abduction moment may be important because of its association with the knee abduction moment.",1
Using a target as external focus of attention results in a better jump-landing technique in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction – A cross-over study,2023-05-23,2023,Elsevier BV,The Knee,"Maria Bæktoft van Weert, Michael Skovdal Rathleff, Peter Eppinga, Carsten Møller Mølgaard, Wouter Welling","Background Improving jump-landing technique during rehabilitation is important and may be achieved through different feedback techniques, i.e., internal focus of attention (IF) or external focus of attention using a target (EF). However, there is a lack of evidence on the most effective feedback technique after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential difference in jump-landing techniques between IF and EF instructions in patients after ACLR. Methods Thirty patients (12 females, mean age 23.26 ± 4.91 years) participated after ACLR. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups that each followed a different testing sequence. Patients performed a drop vertical jump-landing test after receiving instructions with varying types of focus of attention. The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) assessed the jump-landing technique. Results EF was associated with a significantly better LESS score (P < 0.001) compared with IF. Only EF instructions led to improvements in jump-landing technique. Conclusion Using a target as EF resulted in a significantly better jump-landing technique than IF in patients after ACLR. This indicates that increased use of EF could or might result in a better treatment outcome during ACLR rehabilitation.",1
Comparison of the physiological responses and time-motion characteristics during football small-sided games: effect of pressure on the ball,2023-05-19,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Xiaohu Chen, Rui Zheng, Bo Xiong, Xiaoling Huang, Bingnan Gong","Introduction: This study aimed to compare the effects of pressure on the ball on physiological responses and time-motion characteristics during football small-sided games between elite youth male players. Methods: 56 elite male youth football players (age: 15.43 ± 0.52 years) performed a 2+GK vs. 2+GK game on a 30 m × 15 m pitch area with two playing conditions: 1) free play (FP), the player has no limitation to play; 2) pressure on the ball (PB), the player has directly and aggressively closed down space (located within 1.5 m) between themselves and the opposition player with the ball and can compete for possession. The percentage of time spent in different maximum heart rate (HRmax) zones, mean heart rate, blood lactate acid concentration, total distance covered, distance covered in three speed zones (sprint, high speed, and moderate speed), number of high speed runs, number of sprint runs, top speed, number of direction changes, and ball recovery time were monitored. Results: We found very significantly higher number of high speed runs (p < 0.001; ES = 1.154), number of direction changes (p < 0.001; ES = 2.347), ball recovery time (p < 0.001; ES = 3.529), percentage of time spent in 90%-100% HRmax (p < 0.001; ES = 3.033), mean heart rate (p < 0.001; ES = 1.940), blood lactate acid concentration (p < 0.001; ES = 2.245) and significantly higher high speed running distance covered (p = 0.004; ES = 0.520) in the PB condition. Conversely, the FP condition showed very significantly higher moderate speed running distance covered (p < 0.001; ES = 1.814) and significantly higher percentage of time spent in 80%-90% HRmax (p = 0.012; ES = 0.440). No significant differences were revealed on sprint running distance covered (p = 0.407; ES = 0.140), number of sprint runs (p = 0.103; ES = 0.279), top speed (p = 0.130; ES = 0.258) and percentage of time spent in 60%-70% HRmax (p = 0.106; ES = 0.276), 70%-80% HRmax (p = 0.358; ES = 0.155). Discussion: We found that pressure on the ball had a substantial impact on the intensity of training, as evidenced by a significantly increased high speed running performance, number of directional changes, percentage of time spent at 90%-100% of maximum heart rate, mean heart rate, and blood lactate acid concentration. Additionally, ball recovery time decreased significantly.",1
"Does Headgear Prevent Sport-Related Concussion? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Including 6311 Players and 173,383 Exposure Hours",2023-05-19,2023,SAGE Publications,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,"Wesam Saleh A. Al Attar, Hayam Mahmoud, Abdulaziz Alfadel, Oliver Faude","Context: A sport-related concussion (SRC) is a traumatic brain injury that is caused by biomechanical stresses and results in a complex pathophysiological process in the brain. Some in the sporting community believe that headgear (HG) can prevent SRC, and several professional Australian sports organizations, including rugby, football, and soccer clubs, recommend its use. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether HG is effective in lowering the prevalence of SRC in sports. Data Sources: A systematic search for related studies published between 1985 and 2023 was conducted using the following databases: Cochrane Library, AMED, PubMed, Web of Science, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Study Selection: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of HG in reducing SRC rate were included. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. Level of Evidence: Level 1a. Data Extraction: Two researchers independently completed the title and abstract search and performed full-text reviews. A third reviewer was consulted to reach a consensus if any discrepancies were noted. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included RCTs. Data recorded from each study included authors, year of publication, type and number of players, study design, duration of the study, injury rate, compliance (%), sports/level, and exposure hours. Results: The pooled results of 6311 players and 173,383 exposure hours showed 0% SRC reduction per 1000 hours of exposure in the experimental group compared with the control group, with an injury risk ratio of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.82-1.30; P = 0.79). Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that HG does not prevent SRC among soccer and rugby players, and therefore the findings from this meta-analysis do not currently support the use of HG to prevent SRC in soccer or rugby.",1

Following the validation of the Hawkin Dynamics Inc. (HD) proprietary software in recent literature, the aim of this study was to determine the concurrent validity of the HD wireless dual force plate hardware for assessing vertical jumps. During a single testing session, the HD force plates were placed directly atop two adjacent Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc. in-ground force plates (the “gold standard”) to simultaneously collect vertical ground reaction forces produced by 20 participants (27 ± 6 years, 85 ± 14 kg, 176.5 ± 9.23 cm) during the countermovement jump (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) tests (1000 Hz). Agreement between force plate systems was determined via ordinary least products regression using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. No bias was present between the two force plate systems for any of the CMJ and DJ variables, except DJ peak braking force (proportional bias) and DJ peak braking power (fixed and proportional bias). The HD system may be considered a valid alternative to the industry gold standard for assessing vertical jumps because fixed or proportional bias was identified for none of the CMJ variables (n = 17) and only 2 out of 18 DJ variables.",1
Brain activity associated with quadriceps strength deficits after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,2023-05-17,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Cody R. Criss, Adam S. Lepley, James A. Onate, Brian C. Clark, Janet E. Simon, Christopher R. France, Dustin R. Grooms","Abstract Prolonged treatment resistant quadriceps weakness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) contributes to re-injury risk, poor patient outcomes, and earlier development of osteoarthritis. The origin of post-injury weakness is in part neurological in nature, but it is unknown whether regional brain activity is related to clinical metrics of quadriceps weakness. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to better understand the neural contributions to quadriceps weakness after injury by evaluating the relationship between brain activity for a quadriceps-dominated knee task (repeated cycles of unilateral knee flexion/extension from 45° to 0°), , and strength asymmetry in individuals returned to activity after ACL-R. Forty-four participants were recruited (22 with unilateral ACL reconstruction; 22 controls) and peak isokinetic knee extensor torque was assessed at 60°/s to calculate quadriceps limb symmetry index (Q-LSI, ratio of involved/uninvolved limb). Correlations were used to determine the relationship of mean % signal change within key sensorimotor brain regions and Q-LSI. Brain activity was also evaluated group wise based on clinical recommendations for strength (Q-LSI &lt; 90%, n = 12; Q-LSI ≥ 90%, n = 10; controls, all n = 22 Q-LSI ≥ 90%). Lower Q-LSI was related to increased activity in the contralateral premotor cortex and lingual gyrus ( p &lt; .05). Those who did not meet clinical recommendations for strength demonstrated greater lingual gyrus activity compared to those who met clinical recommendations Q-LSI ≥ 90 and healthy controls ( p &lt; 0.05). Asymmetrically weak ACL-R patients displayed greater cortical activity than patients with no underlying asymmetry and healthy controls.",1
Effect of Kinesio tape and Compression sleeves on delayed onset of muscle soreness: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial,2023-05-17,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Xiali Xue, Yuerong Hao, Xinwei Yang, Chaoyang Zhang, Jie Xu, Xiaolei Wu, Zhongyi Deng, Ning Li","Abstract Background Both Kinesio Tape (KT) and Compression Sleeves (CS) can relieve Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) to a certain extent, but there is no study report on the difference in the effectiveness of the KT and CS whether the effect is better when used at the same time. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of KT and CS on the recovery of muscle soreness, isokinetic strength, and body fatigue after DOMS. Methods In this single-blinded randomized controlled trial, 32 participants aged 18 to 24 years were randomly divided into Control group (CG), Compression Sleeves group (CSG), Kinesio Tape group (KTG), Compression Sleeves and Kinesio Tape group (CSKTG), between October 2021 and January 2022. KTG uses Kinesio Tape, CSG wears Compression Sleeves, and CSKTG uses both Compression Sleeves and Kinesio Tape. Outcomes were performed at five-time points (baseline, 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h), Primary outcome was pain level Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Secondary outcomes were Interleukin 6, Peak Torque/Body Weight, Work Fatigue. Statistical analyses were performed using the repeated measures analysis of variance method. Setting: Laboratory. Results After the intervention, VAS reached the highest at 24 h after exercise-induced muscle soreness, while the KTG and CSG at each time point were less than CG, and the scores of CSKTG at 24 h and 48 h were less than those of KTG and CSG in the same period (P &lt; 0.05). Interleukin 6, at 24 h, CSKTG is lower than KTG 0.71( 95%CI: 0.43 to 1.86) and CG 1.68( 95%CI: 0.06 to 3.29). Peak Torque/Body Weight, at 24 h, CG was lower than CSKTG 0.99( 95%CI: 0.42 to 1.56), KTG 0.94( 95%CI: 0.37 to 1.52), and CSG 0.72( 95%CI: 0.14 to 1.29); at 72 h, CG was lower than CSKTG 0.65( 95%CI: 0.13 to 1.17) and KTG 0.58( 95%CI: 0.06 to 1.10). Work Fatigue, at 24 h, CG was lower than KTG 0.10( 95%CI: 0.02 to 1.78) and CSKTG 0.01( 95%CI: -0.07 to 0.09). At 48 h, CG was lower than KTG 0.10( 95%CI: 0.13 to 1.17) and CSKTG 0.11( 95%CI: 0.03 to 0.18). Conclusions Kinesio Tape can significantly reduce DOMS pain, and Kinesio Tape has a better recovery effect on Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness than Compression Sleeves. Kinesio Tape combined with Compression Sleeves is helpful to alleviate the Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness pain, speeding up the recovery of muscle strength, and shortening the recovery time after Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.

Estimating 3D ground reaction forces in running using three inertial measurement units,2023-05-15,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Bouke L. Scheltinga, Joost N. Kok, Jaap H. Buurke, Jasper Reenalda","To understand the mechanisms causing running injuries, it is crucial to get insights into biomechanical loading in the runners' environment. Ground reaction forces (GRFs) describe the external forces on the body during running, however, measuring these forces is usually only possible in a gait laboratory. Previous studies show that it is possible to use inertial measurement units (IMUs) to estimate vertical forces, however, forces in anterior-posterior direction play an important role in the push-off. Furthermore, to perform an inverse dynamics approach, for modelling tissue specific loads, 3D GRFs are needed as input. Therefore, the goal of this work was to estimate 3D GRFs using three inertial measurement units. Twelve rear foot strike runners did nine trials at three different velocities (10, 12 and 14 km/h) and three stride frequencies (preferred and preferred ± 10%) on an instrumented treadmill. Then, data from IMUs placed on the pelvis and lower legs were used as input for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate 3D GRFs. Additionally, estimated vertical GRF from a physical model was used as input to create a hybrid machine learning model. Using different splits in validation and training data, different ANNs were fitted and assembled into an ensemble model. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was used to validate the models. Performance of the machine learning, hybrid machine learning and a physical model were compared. The estimated vs. measured GRF for the hybrid model had a RMSE normalized over the full range of values of 10.8, 7.8 and 6.8% and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.58, 0.91, 0.97 for the mediolateral direction, posterior-anterior and vertical direction respectively. Performance for the three compared models was similar. The ensemble models showed higher model accuracy compared to the ensemble-members. This study is the first to estimate 3D GRF during continuous running from IMUs and shows that it is possible to estimate GRF in posterior-anterior and vertical direction, making it possible to estimate these forces in the outdoor setting. This step towards quantification of biomechanical load in the runners' environment is helpful to gain a better understanding of the development of running injuries.",1
Rationale and Practical Recommendations for Testing Protocols in Female Soccer: A Narrative Review,2023-05-15,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research,"Marco Beato, Naomi Datson, Liam Anderson, Thomas Brownlee, Alex Coates, Andrew Hulton","Beato, M, Datson, N, Anderson, L, Brownlee, T, Coates, A, and Hulton, A. Rationale and practical recommendations for testing protocols in female soccer: A narrative review. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1912-1922, 2023-The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the presented literature on tests (aerobic, speed, changes of direction [COD], strength, power, jump, and anthropometry) of the varied components of female soccer and to draw attention to the most suitable protocols to allow practitioners to accurately track players' fitness status. The 2 most common field tests used to assess aerobic fitness are the Yo-Yo intermittent test (level 1 and level 2) and the 30-15 intermittent fitness test because of an ability to measure multiple players at once with a soccer-specific intermittent profile. The sprinting performance can be assessed on distances of <30 m; however, longer distances (e.g., 40 m) allow for achieving peak speed (flying sprint test), which can be assessed using global navigation satellite system. Changes-of-direction capacity has been found to be an important component of players testing and training programs, although there is no ""gold standard"" to assess COD or repeated sprint ability performance in female players. Lower-limb power can be assessed using jump tests that can use force platforms, jump mats, and optoelectronic devices, while maintaining a good reliability. Several in-direct tests are currently available for assessing anthropometry parameters, such as skinfold thickness, hydrodensitometry, and ultrasound. However, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is the most valid and reliable method for assessing body composition in team sport athletes, with the addition of bone health that is a key measure in female athletes. In conclusion, the evidence reported in this review will be able to aid practitioners, coaches, and researchers to decide which tests meet the requirements of their environment.",1
"The associations of early specialization, sports volume, and maturity status with musculoskeletal injury in elite youth football players",2023-05-11,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Xiang Li, Runze Feng, Shiyi Luo, Chunman Li, Miguel A. Gómez-Ruano","Background: Youth football in schools has experienced rapid growth in China. Despite the increase of players engaging in more frequent, intensive, and organized sports training at their early ages, the controversy over early specialization (ES) still exists. This study aims to: a) investigate the training situation of players in the Chinese School Football Programme and b) examine the associations of early specialization, sports volume, and maturity status with musculoskeletal injury. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was used. Players who participated in the National School Football Winter Camp were invited to fill out a questionnaire that included the data of maturity, ES, sports volume, and injury history ( n = 88 boys and n = 90 girls). Results: The results have shown that 80.3% of the athletes were classified as ES, while 19.7% of them were classified as non-ES. Almost all athletes (96%) participated in a sport for more than 8 months in a year. Most athletes (75.8%) spent more than twice of the time on organized sports than leisure activities. 30.3% of the athletes trained on average more hours per week than the number of their ages. Binomial logistic regression models reflected the significant differences in the odds ratios (OR) of reporting a history of injury among athletes with different levels of specialization ( p = 0.024) and the OR of reporting a history of leg injury among players with different weekly sports volumes ( p = 0.038). Significant differences were also shown in the OR of players reporting foot injuries between players with different maturity states ( p = 0.046), and the Chi-squared test showed significant differences in the OR of reporting acute injuries between players with different levels of specialization ( p = 0.048) and weekly activity ( p = 0.022). No significant differences were found between the remaining variables. Conclusion: Most school football elite players follow the ES pathway even though ES increases the risk of injury, especially acute injury. Pre-pubertal and early pubertal players have a higher incidence of foot injuries. Players who train more hours per week than their ages have more leg injuries and acute injuries. Therefore, priority protection and intervention should be carried out for populations with a high risk of injury.",1

This technical note presents anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with extraarticular anteromedial reinforcement using hamstring and the anterior half of the peroneus longus grafts.",1
Effects of non-extensible lumbar belts on static and dynamic postural stability,2023-05-08,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Jingyuan Bai, Anke Hua, Dongkai Weng, Nan Wang, Jian Wang","Previous studies have found that increased intra-abdominal pressure helps to reduce spinal loading and improve spine stability. Non-extensible lumbar belts (NEBs) could elevate intra-abdominal pressure and augment spinal stability. NEBs have been used in the healthcare field to help reduce pain and improve spine function for people with low back pain. However, the effect of NEBs on static and dynamic postural stability is not clear.This study aimed to investigate whether NEBs affect static and dynamic postural stability. Twenty-eight healthy male subjects were recruited to finish four static postural stability tasks and two dynamic postural stability tests. Center of pressure (COP) values during 30 s of quiet standing, dynamic postural stability index (DPSI) and Y balance test (YBT) score with and without NEBs were analyzed.NEBs had no significant effect in all COP variables in the static postural tasks. The results of a repeated measure two-way ANOVA indicated the NEBs significantly improved the dynamic postural stability in YBT score and DPSI (F (1,27) = 5.506, p = .027, [Formula: see text] and F (1,27) = 83.94, p = .000, [Formula: see text] respectively).The study results indicate that non-extensible belts improve dynamic stability in healthy male participants, with potential implications for rehabilitation and performance enhancement programs.",1
Sport as a conditioning factor in the choice of the plasty to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament. Epidemiological survey and analysis of the current situation,2023-05-05,2023,"Esmon Publicidad, SA",Archivos de Medicina del Deporte,"Jorge Salvador Marín, Juan D. Ayala Mejías","Objective: To know the surgeon’s decision making on the choice of graft in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery according to the sport practiced by the patient. Material and method: An online survey was conducted through the Spanish Society of Sports Traumatology (SETRADE) and the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA). A descriptive analysis of the sample was performed, and an analysis of the main reason for the choice of plasty was carried out stratifying the sample into different groups. Results: 83 surgeons responded to the survey, 71 members of SETRADE and 12 of ESSKA. The mean number of ACL reconstruction performed per year per respondent was 56 (1-220). For 86.7% of the respondents, sport influenced the decision on the type of graft to be used, the main reason being the biomechanical properties of the plasty (49.4%). The mean agreement in the type of graft to be used in each sport studied was 58.29% (71.1%-38.6%). The highest concordance in the plasty of choice occurred in cycling, with respondents using hamstrings in 71.1% of cases. The sports with the least concordance were wrestling and skiing. There were no statistically significant differences in the reason for choosing plasty. Conclusions: The survey was conducted by a significant number of surgeons with experience in ACL surgery, with biomechanical properties being the main reason for choosing which graft to use. Most of them were influenced in this decision by the type of sport practiced. The authors recommend the handling of at least 2 plasties for primary ACL reconstructions and to individualize each case considering the type of sport in the selection of the graft.",1
Acute Rupture of the Plantar Fascia in a Soccer Player,2023-05-04,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Diogo Costa, Patrícia Cruz, Rui Brito, Pedro Cantista, Sérgio Rodrigues-Gomes","Acute rupture of the plantar fascia is a rare but potentially debilitating injury in athletes, particularly those involved in running and jumping sports. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial for a successful recovery and return to play. Conservative treatment, including rest, immobilization, and physical therapy, may be effective in most cases, while surgical intervention may be required in those that are nonresponsive to conservative treatment. We report a case of plantar fascia rupture in a 22-year-old male semi-professional football player who presented with sudden severe pain in the sole of his right foot during a match, followed by a popping sensation and inability to weight bear. The athlete was healthy and had no history of previous injury in the right foot. MRI confirmed a complete rupture of the plantar fascia. The player was treated conservatively and underwent a rehabilitation program. The player returned to full competition after nine weeks, with no limitations.",1
Interdisciplinary sport injury research and the integration of qualitative and quantitative data,2023-05-03,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Medical Research Methodology,"S.E Hausken-Sutter, K Boije af Gennäs, A Schubring, S Grau, J Jungmalm, N Barker-Ruchti","Abstract Background To understand and prevent sport injuries, scholars have employed different scientific approaches and research methods. Traditionally, this research has been monodisciplinary, relying on one subdiscipline of sport science and applying qualitative or quantitative research methods. Recently, scholars have argued that traditional approaches fail to address contextual components of sport and the nonlinear interactions between different aspects in and around the athlete, and, as a way forward, called for alternative approaches to sport injury research. Discussion of alternative approaches are today taking place, however, practical examples that demonstrate what such approaches entails are rare. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to draw on an interdisciplinary research approach to (1) outline an interdisciplinary case analysis procedure (ICAP); and (2) provide an example for future interdisciplinary sport injury research. Methods We adopt an established definition and application of interdisciplinary research to develop and pilot the ICAP for interdisciplinary sport injury teams aiming to integrate qualitative and quantitative sport injury data. The development and piloting of ICAP was possible by drawing on work conducted in the interdisciplinary research project “Injury-free children and adolescents: Towards better practice in Swedish football” (the FIT project). Results The ICAP guides interdisciplinary sport injury teams through three stages: 1. Create a more comprehensive understanding of sport injury aetiology by drawing on existing knowledge from multiple scientific perspectives; 2. Collate analysed qualitative and quantitative sport injury data into a multilevel data catalogue; and 3. Engage in an integrated discussion of the collated data in the interdisciplinary research team. Conclusion The ICAP is a practical example of how an interdisciplinary team of sport injury scholars can approach the complex problem of sport injury aetiology and work to integrate qualitative and quantitative data through three stages. The ICAP is a step towards overcoming the obstacles of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods and data that scholars have identified.",1
Energy cost differences between marathon runners and soccer players: Constant versus shuttle running,2023-05-03,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Johnny Padulo, Antonio Buglione, Alin Larion, Fabio Esposito, Christian Doria, Dražen Čular, Pietro Enrico di Prampero, Leonardo Alexandre Peyré-Tartaruga","Purpose: In the last decades, the energy cost assessment provided new insight on shuttle or constant running as training modalities. No study, though, quantified the benefit of constant/shuttle running in soccer-players and runners. Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify if marathon runners and soccer players present specific energy cost values related to their training experience performing constant and shuttle running. Methods: To this aim, eight runners (age 34 ± 7.30y; training experience 5.70 ± 0.84y) and eight soccer-players (age 18.38 ± 0.52y; training experience 5.75 ± 1.84y) were assessed randomly for 6’ on shuttle-running or constant-running with 3 days of recovery in-between. For each condition, the blood lactate (BL) and the energy cost of constant (C r ) and shuttle running (C Sh ) was determined. To assess differences for metabolic demand in terms of C r , C Sh and BL over the two running conditions on the two groups a MANOVA was used.

On shuttle running, runners had a higher C Sh compared to soccer players (8.66 ± 0.60 J kg −1 m −1 vs. 7.86 ± 0.51 J kg −1 m −1 ; F = 8.282, respectively; with p = 0.012). BL on constant running was lower in runners compared to soccer players (1.06 ± 0.07 mmol L −1 vs. 1.56 ± 0.42 mmol L −1 , respectively; with p = 0.005). Conversely, BL on shuttle running was higher in runners compared to soccer players 7.99 ± 1.49 mmol L −1 vs. 6.04 ± 1.69 mmol L −1 , respectively; with p = 0.028). Conclusion: The energy cost optimization on constant or shuttle running is strictly related to the sport practiced.",1
Regeneration of Partial Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears Using the Technique of Biologic Augmentation with Bone Marrow Concentrate and Platelet-Rich Plasma Under Arthroscopic Visualization,2023-05-03,2023,"Dougmar Publishing Group, Inc.",Biologic Orthopedics Journal,"Ignacio Dallo, Pedro Bernáldez Domínguez","To present clinical outcomes in a preliminary patient cohort using a biologic augmentation technique consisting of intra-ligamentous and intra-articular infiltration of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) under arthroscopic visualization for treatment of isolated and acute partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Athletes with an acute symptomatic partial ACL injury with clinical examination findings of increased anterior tibial translation without rotational instability were treated with the biologic augmentation technique. Patients were followed for 2 years postoperatively. The Lysholm Knee Questionnaire, IKDC Objective score, physical examination findings, MRI, and the KT-1000 arthrometer were used to assess clinical outcomes. Five patients were included in the analysis with a median age of 22. All patients were determined to have a healed ACL on MRI 8 months postoperatively. The median Lysholm Score at the final follow-up of 99 was significantly increased from the median pre-operative score (p = 0.042). In addition, the objective IKDC score improved in all patients postoperatively, and no clinical examination findings of knee instability were identified at the final follow-up. The median side-to-side difference in KT-1000 arthrometer testing was 3 mm pre-operatively and 0 mm at the last follow-up (p = 0.038). The treatment of appropriately indicated partial ACL injuries in this study has demonstrated that restoration of ligamentous structure and function may be achieved by a biologic augmentation technique using intra-ligamentous and intra-articular infiltration of BMAC and PRP. This technique is performed with minimal technical difficulty, leading to excellent 2-year clinical outcomes in this preliminary series of patients.",1
Novel 3D Force Sensors for a Cost-Effective 3D Force Plate for Biomechanical Analysis,2023-05-02,2023,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Jonathan D. Miller, Dimitrije Cabarkapa, Andrew J. Miller, Lance L. Frazer, Tylan N. Templin, Travis D. Eliason, Samuel K. Garretson, Andrew C. Fry, Cory J. Berkland","Three-dimensional force plates are important tools for biomechanics discovery and sports performance practice. However, currently, available 3D force plates lack portability and are often cost-prohibitive. To address this, a recently discovered 3D force sensor technology was used in the fabrication of a prototype force plate. Thirteen participants performed bodyweight and weighted lunges and squats on the prototype force plate and a standard 3D force plate positioned in series to compare forces measured by both force plates and validate the technology. For the lunges, there was excellent agreement between the experimental force plate and the standard force plate in the X-, Y-, and Z-axes (r = 0.950–0.999, p &lt; 0.001). For the squats, there was excellent agreement between the force plates in the Z-axis (r = 0.996, p &lt; 0.001). Across axes and movements, root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 1.17% to 5.36% between force plates. Although the current prototype force plate is limited in sampling rate, the low RMSEs and extremely high agreement in peak forces provide confidence the novel force sensors have utility in constructing cost-effective and versatile use-case 3D force plates.",1

A focus of most healthcare professionals including physical therapists and athletic trainers includes the screening for preventable risk factors for non- contact ACL injuries. Preventable risk factors include asymmetry between a person’s limbs, decreased hamstring strength, increased muscle fatigue, decreased landing angle of hip and knee Tlexion, increased valgus landing, and lack of Tlexibility in the hip internal rotators (Brophy, 2021). Given the short and long-term negative consequences of an ACL injury, it is important for healthcare providers to explore screening and prevention techniques to employ with at-risk athletic populations.",1
Determining the role of Nordic hamstring exercises in preventing hamstring injuries in soccer players: A narrative review,2023-05-01,2023,AkiNik Publications,"International Journal of Physical Education, Sports and Health","Mohammed A Khan, Saad A Suhaimi, Fares A Ahmadi","The most prevalent injury sustained by soccer players involves a hamstring strain or injury. These injuries have been observed in both contact and non-contact sports such as soccer, football, baseball, and cricket, but they can also be found in the general population due to overstretching or sudden muscle pull during daily activities, in soccer alone, the literature reports 15–50% of hamstring injuries, making it the sport with the highest rate of hamstring injuries. Long-term treatment and rehabilitation periods, combined with a high financial burden on players, cause them to miss games and, in some cases, retire from sports at the earliest. Despite of wide-ranging treatments, rehabilitation, and the preventive procedures the risk of recurrence of hamstring injuries remains significantly high. Nordic hamstring exercises (NHE) or Nordic curls are aimed at improving eccentric strength in the hamstring muscles, which is known to be a significant modifiable risk factor in hamstring injury prevention. Numerous studies have examined the effectiveness of Nordic hamstring exercises/curls as a preventative measure to lower the incidence of hamstring injuries in athletes participating in other sports and soccer players. The Nordic Hamstring Exercises (NHE) were incorporated into the FIFA '11' injury prevention program in 2003 and enhanced to develop the FIFA '11+' in 2006 with the aim of reducing hamstring injuries in soccer players. As a matter of fact, the desire to write a paper on this topic is to emphasize the role of Nordic hamstring exercises (NHE) as a preventive measure to lower the incidence of hamstring strains in soccer players and other athletes.",1
Effects of gender and fatigue on strength and activity of gluteus medius muscle during a controlled cutting maneuver in preadolescent athletes,2023-04-29,2023,Elsevier BV,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology,"G. Jonasson, M.H. Ghasemi, U.S. Jonsdottir, K. Briem, P. Sveinsson","The present study aimed to investigate the effects of gender on hip muscle strength and activity during a controlled cutting maneuver in preadolescent athletes. Fifty-six football and handball preadolescent players participated (35 females and 21 males). Normalized mean activity of the gluteus medius (GM) muscle was measured using surface electromyography during cutting maneuvers in pre-activation and eccentric phases. The stance duration and the strength of hip abductors and external rotators were recorded with a force plate and a handheld dynamometer, respectively. Descriptive statistics and mixed model analysis were used to assess statistical difference (α = 0.05). The results showed that boys activate the GM muscle significantly more than girls during the pre-activation phase (P = 0.022). Boys also demonstrated greater normalized strength of hip external rotation than girls (P = 0.038), but not for hip abduction or duration of stance (P > 0.05). When adjusted for abduction strength, however, boys had significantly shorter stance duration than girls (P = 0.006). It seems that sex-dependent differences are present in preadolescent athletes as observed in the strength of hip external rotator muscles and neuromuscular activity of the GM muscle during a cutting maneuver. Future studies are needed to investigate whether these changes influence risk of lower limb/ACL injury during sport activities.",1

The knee valgus angle is a fundamental axis for injury prevention and is usually measured with 2D systems such as Kinovea software (Version 0.9.4.). Technological advances such as computer vision have the potential to revolutionize sports medicine. However, the validity and reliability of computer vision must be evaluated before using it in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to analyze the test-retest and inter-rater reliability and the concurrent validity of a beta version app based on computer vision for the measurement of knee valgus angle in elite handball athletes. Methods: The knee valgus angle of 42 elite handball athletes was measured. A frontal photo during a single-leg squat was taken, and two examiners measured the angle by the beta application based on computer vision at baseline and at one-week follow-up to calculate the test-retest and inter-rater reliability. A third examiner assessed the knee valgus angle using 2D Kinovea software to calculate the concurrent validity. Results: The knee valgus angle in the elite handball athletes was 158.54 ± 5.22°. The test-retest reliability for both examiners was excellent, showing an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.859–0.933. The inter-rater reliability showed a moderate ICC: 0.658 (0.354–0.819). The standard error of the measurement with the app was stated between 1.69° and 3.50°, and the minimum detectable change was stated between 4.68° and 9.70°. The concurrent validity was strong r = 0.931; p &lt; 0.001. Conclusions: The computer-based smartphone app showed an excellent test-retest and inter-rater reliability and a strong concurrent validity compared to Kinovea software for the measurement of the knee valgus angle.",1

There are three stages in injuries: 1 Diagnosis, 2 Physiotherapy – Rehabilitation, 3 Reintegration. The present study investigated the reintegration actions (return to play – RTP) for eight professional footballers (Super League 1) after hamstring strain. Eight professional soccer players who had hamstring injuries with Grade 2 strain were measured and evaluated. Two measurements were taken before and after injury. The first measurement involved maximum effort field tests of 30, 40, 50 and 60 meters in a straight line without a ball, using global positioning system (GPS) devices placed on the athletes for the interpretation and evaluation of their results. The second measurement aimed to evaluate the maximum strength of the eight players before and after their injury, using squats, bench presses and leg curl exercises on the machine. The statistical analysis included descriptive and inductive statistics (paired t-test). Analysis of the data collected showed that all soccer players had higher performance in the measurements taken after injury, both in speed and in maximal strength. In conclusion, following the appropriate rehabilitation and reintegration, the eight athletes were not affected by their injury and managed to return to competitive action (RTP) without recurrence and maximizing their performance.",1

Resistance training,2023-04-27,2023,Routledge,Science and Soccer,"Conall Murtagh, David Rydings, Barry Drust","In this chapter, the authors present a novel systematic process for the prescription of resistance training for the soccer player. The literature would agree with anecdotal evidence that performing the resistance training necessary to enhance force production can take over 48 h to recover from. Researchers using bony palpation methods observed that 92.5% of soccer players are suffering from multiple innominate malalignments. While applying force more efficiently is thought to reduce the risk of overuse injury, the ability of the muscle-tendon unit to tolerate a high volume of repetitive forceful actions performed at high speeds may decrease the risk of significant microtrauma and subsequent tissue failure. Production, application, and tolerance resistance training interventions could benefit the elite player by improving their chances of staying healthy and achieving more successful match play performance. Competitive matches typically represents the highest physiological and biomechanical stress on the player's body.",1
Biomechanical assessments,2023-04-27,2023,Routledge,Science and Soccer,"Mark A. Robinson, Katherine A.J.

A suite of measurement tools and techniques exists to provide detailed, objective, and quantitative data to understand and evaluate the physical status and biomechanical effectiveness of players. The evaluation of jump performance has traditionally been part of pre-season screening. Decisions about which type of jump to test are typically interlinked with the available time and technology. Electromyography is used to measure and evaluate the electrical activity of a muscle. The most evident application in the practical setting is to provide real-time feedback on whether and how a muscle is functioning during activities, typically in a rehabilitation context. Muscular strength is a key component of physical performance and injury prevention. An isokinetic dynamometer is a sophisticated tool used to assess muscle strength under controlled circumstances, most commonly at a constant (isokinetic) velocity of joint angular rotation.",1
Differences in Neurocognitive Functions Between Healthy Controls and Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Reconstructed Male Athletes Who Passed or Failed Return to Sport Criteria: A Preliminary Study,2023-04-25,2023,Human Kinetics,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,"Maryam Kiani Haft Lang, Razieh Mofateh, Neda Orakifar, Shahin Goharpey","Only 55% of anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed (ACLR) athletes return to competitive sports. This brings into question the usefulness of current return to sport (RTS) criteria. High cognitive demand of sport environment clarifies the value of incorporating neurocognitive tests when making decisions regarding the time of RTS. This preliminary study aimed to compare the neurocognitive functions between healthy controls and ACLR male athletes who passed or failed RTS criteria.A total of 45 male football players, including 15 ACLR who passed RTS criteria, 15 ACLR who did not pass, and 15 healthy controls participated in this cross-sectional study. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery was used to measure a battery of neurocognitive tasks, including speed of response, sustained attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and response inhibition.The results revealed that compared with both the ACLR-passed and healthy groups, the ACLR-failed group showed greater values of 5-choice movement time (P = .02, P = .01, respectively) but lower values of stop signal reaction time (P = .03, P = .001, respectively) and proportion of successful stops variables (P = .02). In addition, compared with the healthy group, both the ACLR-failed and ACLR-passed groups indicated greater values in between errors (P < .001, P = .008, respectively) and reaction latency variables (P = .002, P = .01, respectively) but lower values of A' (P < .001, P = .007, respectively), probability of hit (P < .001, P = .03, respectively), and percent correct trials variables (P = .006, P = .02, respectively).Our findings indicated deficits in neurocognitive functions in ACLR male athletes. In addition, poor performance in sustained attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility measures observed in the ACLR-passed group highlighted the necessity for using a multimodal approach via implementation of neurocognitive measures in conjunction with the functional and muscular assessments when making RTS decisions.",1

Anatomical Landmark Technique for Femoral Tunnel Placement of Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis,2023-04-24,2023,Elsevier BV,Arthroscopy Techniques,"Abhey Wasdev, Anoop P, Rinju Krishnan, Alvin Thomas, Sandesh Manohar G, Rajkumar S. Amaravathi","The anterolateral ligament is a crucial part of the anterolateral complex of the knee, providing rotator stability to the knee and being a primary restraint to tibial internal rotation. Lateral extra-articular tenodesis added to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction can reduce pivot shift without sacrificing the range of motion or increasing the risk of osteoarthritis. A 7- to 8-cm longitudinal skin incision is made and a 9.5- to 10-cm × 1- cm wide iliotibial band graft is dissected, leaving the distal attachment intact. The free end is whip stitched. One of the most important steps during the procedure is the identification of the site of attachment of the iliotibial band graft. The leash of vessels, fat pad, lateral supracondylar ridge, and fibular collateral ligament serve as important landmarks. The tunnel is drilled from the lateral femoral cortex with a guide pin and reamer pointing 20 to 30° anteriorly and proximally while the arthroscope visualizes the femoral anterior cruciate ligament tunnel. The graft is routed under the fibular collateral ligament. The graft is fixed with a bioscrew while the knee is kept in 30° flexion and the tibia is kept in neutral rotation. We believe that lateral extra-articular tenodesis gives the anterior cruciate ligament graft a good chance for faster healing along with addressing anterolateral rotatory instability. Choosing a correct fixation point is very important to restore normal knee biomechanics.",1
Impact of the Anatomical Accelerometer Placement on Vertical Jump Performance Characteristics,2023-04-21,2023,MDPI AG,Sports,"Damjana V. Cabarkapa, Dimitrije Cabarkapa, Nicolas M. Philipp, Andrew C.

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of the anatomical placement of an accelerometer on biomechanical characteristics of countermovement vertical jump with and without an arm swing when compared to the force plate as a criterion measure. Seventeen recreationally active individuals (ten males and seven females) volunteered to participate in the present study. Four identical accelerometers sampling at 100 Hz were placed at the following anatomical locations: upper-back (UB), chest (CH), abdomen (AB), and hip (HP). While standing on a uni-axial force plate system sampling at 1000 Hz, each participant completed three non-sequential maximal countermovement vertical jumps with and without an arm swing. All devices recorded the data simultaneously. The following variables of interest were obtained from ground reaction force curves: peak concentric force (PCF), peak landing force (PLF), and vertical jump height (VJH). The findings of the present study reveal that the most appropriate anatomical locations to place the accelerometer device when attempting to estimate PCF, PLF, and VJH during a countermovement vertical jump with no arm swing are CH, AB, and UB, and during a countermovement vertical jump with an arm swing are UB, HP, and UB, respectively. Overall, these findings may help strength and conditioning professionals and sports scientists to select appropriate anatomical locations when using innovative accelerometer technology to monitor vertical jump performance characteristics.",1
ASPECTS OF TECHNICAL AND TACTICAL TRAINING OF YOUNG FOOTBALL PLAYERS,2023-04-21,2023,National Pedagogical Dragomanov University,Scientific Journal of National Pedagogical Dragomanov University. Series 15. Scientific and pedagogical problems of physical culture (physical culture and sports),"V. V. Nikolaienko, M. I. Vorobiov","Training of sports reserve for professional football has always attracted much attention. This is evidenced by a significant number of studies devoted to this issue, within which experts in professional children's and youth football emphasize the lack of necessary engagement in elite sport young athletes, well-prepared in terms of technical and tactical skills. One of adequate responses in the considered aspect is further improvement of efficient training of a prospective competitive sports reserve based on intensified improvement of quality of scientific and methodical support during training process. The aim of the research work is to substantiate scientific approaches to formation of a step-by-step management system within the long-term process of developing football players’ technical and tactical skills. We have carried out the analysis of program documents, literature sources and practical activities of children's coaches in the process of implementing long-term training programs for young football players in leading European football academies and national federations. A number of fundamental and systemic differences between traditional and progressive approaches to arrangement of educational and training process have been shown. It has been determined that the existing “organized” football, the system of conducting children's and youth competitions, as well as pedagogical approaches to training young talents, are aimed at speeding up training process, achieving instant results, team-group form of conducting classes, which do not contribute to individual development and training of a smart player, capable of creatively approaching the solution of tactical and technical tasks. We have substantiated approaches to making changes in the practice of long-term training for young football players based on application of situational game method, which is a key point for effective training, development of individual capabilities and formation of game intelligence. A strategy for managing training process has been determined based on the introduction of a phased (gradual) system of tactical and technical training for young football players, which will further determine player's potential at professional level. We have indicated the necessity of making changes to pedagogical approaches of managing sports activities for young football players and evaluating the effectiveness of children's coaches’ work.",1
Acute effects of the FIFA11+ and Football+ warm-ups on motor performance. A crossover randomized controlled trial,2023-04-20,2023,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Mojtaba Asgari, Marcus Schmidt, Benedikt Terschluse, Maximilian Sueck, Thomas Jaitner","Introduction Few studies including contradictory results have addressed the acute effects of the 11+ on motor performance, indicating a potentially reduced applicability of the program for warming up before competitions. This study aims to compare the acute effects of a soccer-specific warm-up (Football+) and the 11+ on motor performance. Materials and methods Thirty-eight volunteer collegiate players (22 males; age = 21.1±1.9 years, height = 1.81± 0.06 m, weight = 73.4± 9.5 kg; 16 females; age = 21.3±1.5 years; height = 1.71± 0.07 m, weight = 67.8± 8.5 kg) underwent the 11+ and the Football+ in a randomized crossover design with a one-week washout. The Football+ starts with a self-estimated 40–50 percent running, followed by dynamic stretching of the hip muscles, shoulder contact, controlled lunge, Copenhagen exercise, and modified Nordic hamstring exercise. The second part involves roughly intensive small-sided games, followed by plyometric and anaerobic exercises in the third part. The warm ups’ effects on performance were determined by a linear sprinting test (20 m), countermovement jump performance (CMJ), Illinois agility (IA), and dribbling speed (DS) tests. Within-subject differences were reported as the means and SD. Pairwise t tests at the significance level of p&lt;0.05 were used to calculate the significant differences. Results Overall, except for the CMJ (mean = -0.43±3.20 cm, p = 0.21, d = -0.13), significant differences for the 20 m sprint (mean = 0.04±0.10 s, p = 0.005, d = 0.42), IA (mean = 0.65±0.45 s, p = 0.01, d = 1.43), and DS (mean = 0.60±1.58 s, p = 0.012, d = 0.38) were observed. In females, significant differences observed only for IA (mean difference = 0.52±0.42 s, p&lt;0.001, d = 1.24) and DS (mean difference = 1.29±1,77 s, p = 0.005, d = 0.73), with the Football+ showing superiority. In males, significant differences were found only for 20 m sprinting (mean difference = 0.06±0.09, p = 0.005, d = 0.60) and IA (mean difference = 0.74±0.46, p&lt;0.001, d = 1.62), with the Football+ having superiority. Discussion Although practicable for injury prevention, the 11+ may not optimize acute performance and prepare players for high-intensity physical tasks as well as a well-structured, roughly intensive warm-up. Further gender-specific studies should evaluate the long-term effects of the Football+ on performance and injury prevention.",1
Neuromuscular Changes in Drop Jumps on Different Common Material Surfaces with Incremental Drop Heights,2023-04-20,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Hsien-Te Peng, Hsiu-Kuang Chang, Hung-Wen Chen, Tsung-I Huang, Hui Chen","The purpose of this study was to compare changes in muscle pre-activation and short-latency responses in the lower limbs during drop jumps performed on different common soft and hard surfaces and at various platform heights. The study aimed to collect electromyography data from the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus of the dominant leg during drop jumps on sand, turf, polyurethane, and wood surfaces from platform heights of 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm. Muscle pre-activation refers to muscle activity 100 ms before ground contact during a drop jump, while short-latency responses refer to muscle activation occurring 30–60 ms after ground contact. These definitions were used to measure and analyze neuromuscular responses in the lower limb muscles during drop jumps using various surfaces and platform heights. Sand as a ground material and platform heights of 50 and 60 cm significantly enhanced pre-activation and activation in short-latency responses of the lower limb muscles (all p &lt; 0.01). The difficulty of the drop jump task can enhance pre-activation and activation in the latency responses of lower limb muscles. It is recommended that athletes perform drop jumps on sandy surfaces or from platforms higher than 50 cm to induce muscle pre-activation of the lower limbs and to improve muscle activation levels in the latency responses after landing.",1
The Relationship between Functional Movement Screen Scores and Athlete Performance in Recreational Football Players,2023-04-18,2023,Informatics Publishing Limited,Journal of Ecophysiology and Occupational Health,"Mehnaz Khaleel, Sudhakar Subramanian","Introduction: Athletics is always accompanied by an inherent risk of injuries. It is very essential to determine the ability of a person to participate in sporting events. Functional mobility skills are important talents that should be assessed up to 10 years of age, as these skills are the foundation for a variety of sports. After the age of 10 years, it is essential to improve some athletic talents, such as agility, mobility, and flexibility. Therefore Functional movement screen scoring (FMS) has already been used as a test to make evaluating movement patterns in ordinary sports practice easier. Aim: This study aims to detect if there is a relationship between FMS and hamstring flexibility and agility. Materials Methods: Sixtysix subjects were chosen based on a set of eligibility criteria and were allotted to two distinct groups (group A FMS&gt;14, group B FMS&lt;14) using a convenient sampling technique. Group A (FMS&gt;14) is a correlation done between FMS that was assessed using the FMS kit along with hamstring flexibility using the AKE test and Agility using IAT. Group B (FMS&lt;14) is a correlation done between FMS that was assessed using the FMS kit along with hamstring flexibility using AKE and agility using IAT. The results were calculated using a coefficient correlation test. Outcome Measures: FMS, AKE, IAT. Results: There was a positive correlation between FMS and agility that is when FMS were high, the agility time was less and vice versa. The relationship of FMS with knee extension was positive, suggesting that when FMS were high, knee extension was more and vice versa. Conclusion: This study states that there is a positive correlation between FMS with athlete performance among recreational football players.",1
The Use of Neurofeedback in Sports Training: Systematic Review,2023-04-14,2023,MDPI AG,Brain Sciences,"Łukasz Rydzik, Wojciech Wąsacz, Tadeusz Ambroży, Norollah Javdaneh, Karolina Brydak, Marta Kopańska","Biofeedback training is a method commonly used in various fields of life, for example, in medicine, sports training or business. In recent studies, it has been shown that biofeedback, and neurofeedback, can affect the performance of professional athletes. Training based on the neurofeedback method includes exercising the brain waves. The aim of the article is to evaluate the influence of neurofeedback training on the physical fitness of professional athletes representing various sports disciplines, such as judo, volleyball and soccer. Based on 10 scientific papers from various sources, including PubMed, the latest research on neurofeedback and its impact on athletes has been reviewed. On the basis of the literature review from 2012 to 2022 on the neurofeedback method in sports training, it can be stated that this type of practice has a significant impact on physical fitness and sports performance. This review comprised 10 research studies with 491 participants in the neurofeedback groups, and 62 participants in the control group. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated the quality of the studies utilising the PEDro scale. Properly planned and conducted neurofeedback training affects stimulation and improvement of many variables (reducing stress levels, increasing the ability to self-control physiological factors, enhancing behavioural efficiency and meliorating the speed of reaction to a stimulus).",1
"Comparing the Effects of Differential and Visuo-Motor Training on Functional Performance, Biomechanical, and Psychological Factors in Athletes after ACL Reconstruction: A Randomized Controlled Trial",2023-04-13,2023,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Fatemeh Gholami, Amir Letafatkar, Yousef Moghadas Tabrizi, Alli Gokeler, Giacomo Rossettini, Hadi Abbaszadeh Ghanati, Wolfgang Immanuel Schöllhorn","Variation during practice is widely accepted to be advantageous for motor learning and is, therefore, a valuable strategy to effectively reduce high-risk landing mechanics and prevent primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Few attempts have examined the specific effects of variable training in athletes who have undergone ACL reconstruction. Thereby, it is still unclear to what extent the variations in different sensor areas lead to different effects. Accordingly, we compared the effects of versatile movement variations (DL) with variations of movements with emphasis on disrupting visual information (VMT) in athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction. Forty-five interceptive sports athletes after ACL reconstruction were randomly allocated to a DL group (n = 15), VT group (n = 15), or control group (n = 15). The primary outcome was functional performance (Triple Hop Test). The secondary outcomes included dynamic balance (Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)), biomechanics during single-leg drop-landing task hip flexion (HF), knee flexion (KF), ankle dorsiflexion (AD), knee valgus (KV), and vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), and kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK)) assessed before and after the 8 weeks of interventions. Data were analyzed by means of 3 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison (Bonferroni) at the significance level of p ≤ 0.05. Significant group × time interaction effects, main effect of time, and main effect of group were found for the triple hop test and all eight directions, SEBT, HF, KF, AD, KV, VGRF, and TSK. There was no significant main effect of group in the HF and triple hop test. Additionally, significant differences in the triple hop test and the seven directions of SEBT, HF, KF, KV, VGRF, and TSK were found between the control group and the DL and VMT groups. Between group differences in AD and the medial direction of SEBT were not significant. Additionally, there were no significant differences between VMT and the control group in the triple hop test and HF variables. Both motor learning (DL and VMT) programs improved outcomes in patients after ACL reconstruction. The findings suggest that DL and VMT training programs lead to comparable improvements in rehabilitation.",1
"A test battery for evaluation of muscle strength, balance and functional performance in subjects with chronic ankle instability: a cross-sectional study",2023-04-13,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Sofia Ryman Augustsson, Erik Sjöstedt","Studies investigating ankle condition in subjects with chronic ankle instability (CAI) using an on-the-field test battery are scarce. Understanding which tests that are most challenging for these subjects has the potential to set realistic goals in rehabilitation and return-to-sports criteria. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to investigate CAI subjects regarding strength, balance and functional performance with an easily used test battery that required minimal equipment. This study was conducted with a cross-sectional design. A total of 20 CAI subjects, engaged in sports, and 15 healthy subjects serving as a control group, were tested for assessment of strength, balance and functional performance. A test battery was developed accordingly; isometric strength in inversion and eversion, the single leg stance test (SLS), single leg hop for distance (SLHD) and side hop test. The limb symmetry index was calculated to determine whether a side-to-side lower limb difference could be classified as normal or abnormal. The sensitivity of the test battery was also calculated. The subjects were 20% weaker on the injured side compared with the non-injured side in eversion (p < 0.01) and 16% weaker in inversion (p < 0.01) (Table 2). For the SLS test, the mean score of the injured side was 8 points (67%) higher (more foot lifts) compared to the non-injured side (p < 0.01). The mean distance of the SLHD was 10 cm (9%) shorter for the injured side compare to the non-injured side (p = 0.03). The mean number of side hop was 11 repetitions (29%) fewer for the injured side compare to the non-injured side (p < 0.01). Six of the 20 subjects obtained abnormal LSI values in all five tests whereas none obtained normal values in all tests. The sensitivity of the test battery was 100%. Deficits in muscle strength, balance and functional performance appear to be present in CAI subjects with the largest impairments in balance and side hop performance, which stresses the need for return to sport criteria for this group of subjects.

VARIOUS METHODS OF EARLY REHABILITATION OF ATHLETES WITH ANKLE JOINT INJURIES,2023-04-13,2023,EPRA JOURNALS,EPRA International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research (IJMR),"Ravshanova Maftuna Zohidjonovna, Botirov Farxod Kodirovich","Among the emerging sports injuries, injuries of the upper and lower extremities deserve special attention. Most of the injuries of the lower extremities are injuries of the ankle joint. The main pathogenic link in the occurrence of an ankle joint injury is the level of impact of the traumatic moment. Further, the processes of damage to the soft tissue component, the ligamentous -muscular apparatus and bone-articular structures begin. Then it manifests itself mainly in the development of soft tissue edema in the area of the injury, followed by the launch and development of pathogenic changes. Blood and lymphatic vessels are damaged, which are the main trigger for the formation of edema. All these processes are associated with the occurrence of subsequent compression of the surrounding tissues, an increase in edema and the development of a severe pain syndrome. The search for literature sources made it possible to determine the existing problem and assess the relevance of the ongoing scientific research. The study is aimed at developing and searching for new modern methods, therapy regimens. The aim of the work is to improve the quality of therapy for ankle joint injuries in athletes and to achieve early recovery of lost functions with a return to full-fledged sports activity",1
Correlation between lumbopelvic stability and hamstring strain recurrence in sprinters,2023-04-12,2023,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Physiotherapy Quarterly,"Zeba Zeba, M.

Methods A retrospective case-control study with a sample of nineteen participants including seven healthy sprinters and twelve sprinters with strained hamstring (mean age: 19.42 ± 2.29 and 18.58 ± 1.62 years, respectively) were examined to assess the effect of altered lumbopelvic stability using factors such as hip flexor length, sacral mobility, internal rotation range, hamstring length and neuromuscular control of spine. Results Results revealed no significant correlation of neuromuscular control of spine with right (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.28, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.35) and left (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.09, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.71) side hamstring strain recurrence. A significant positive correlation was observed between: right side hamstring length and right-side internal rotation range (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), right side hamstring length and left side internal rotation range (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.81, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), left side hamstring length and right-side internal rotation range (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.67, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), left side hamstring length and left side internal rotation range (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.82, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The neuromuscular control of spine was not significantly correlated with lumbopelvic stability related factors. Also, no significant difference in sacral mobility between the groups was found. Conclusions The hip flexor length, internal rotation range and hamstring length can be considered as useful factors in order to assess the risk of injury of hamstring muscle in sprinters.",1
Differences in Body Composition between Playing Positions in Men’s Professional Soccer: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,2023-04-11,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Jaime Sebastiá-Rico, José Miguel Martínez-Sanz, Noelia González-Gálvez, Jose M. Soriano","The performance of male soccer players (MSPs) depends on multiple factors, such as body composition. It is understandable to think that, due to the physical demands and specific functions during play, body composition may vary depending on the playing position. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to describe the anthropometric, BC, and somatotype characteristics of professional MSPs and to compare the reported values according to playing position. We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science following the PRISMA statement. Random-effects meta-analysis, a pooled summary of means, and 95% CI (method or equation) were calculated. Random models were used with the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) method. Twenty-six articles were included in the systematic review and the meta-analysis. After comparing the groups according to the playing position (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward), significant differences were found in age, height, weight, the sum of skinfolds, kilograms of muscle mass, and kilograms of fat-free mass (p = 0.001; p &lt; 0.0001). No significant differences were observed in fat mass, percentage of fat-free mass, percentage of muscle mass, bone mass, and somatotype.

Plyometric-Jump Training Effects on Physical Fitness and Sport-Specific Performance According to Maturity: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis,2023-04-10,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Rodrigo Ramirez-Campillo, Andrew Sortwell, Jason Moran, José Afonso, Filipe Manuel Clemente, Rhodri S. Lloyd, Jon L. Oliver, Jason Pedley, Urs Granacher","Among youth, plyometric-jump training (PJT) may provide a safe, accessible, and time-efficient training method. Less is known on PJT effectiveness according to the maturity status.This systematic review with meta-analysis set out to analyse the body of peer-reviewed articles assessing the effects of PJT on measures of physical fitness [i.e., maximal dynamic strength; change of direction (COD) speed; linear sprint speed; horizontal and vertical jump performance; reactive strength index] and sport-specific performance (i.e., soccer ball kicking and dribbling velocity) according to the participants' maturity status.Systematic searches were conducted in three electronic databases using the following inclusion criteria: (i) Population: healthy participants aged < 18 years; (ii) Intervention: PJT program including unilateral and/or bilateral jumps; (iii) Comparator: groups of different maturity status with control groups; (iv) Outcomes: at least one measure of physical fitness and/or sport-specific performance before and after PJT; (v) experimental design with an active or passive control group, and two or more maturity groups exposed to the same PJT. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were used to compute the meta-analysis. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro checklist. GRADE was applied to assess certainty of evidence.From 11,028 initially identified studies across three electronic databases, 11 studies were finally eligible to be meta-analysed (n total = 744; seven studies recruited males; four studies recruited females). Three studies were rated as high quality (6 points), and eight studies were of moderate quality (5 points). Seven studies reported the maturity status using age at peak height velocity (PHV; pre-PHV values up to - 2.3; post-PHV up to 2.5). Another four studies used Tanner staging (from Tanner I to V). The training programmes ranged from 4 to 36 weeks, using 1-3 weekly training sessions. When compared to controls, pre-PHV and post-PHV participants obtained small-to-moderate improvements (ES = 0.35 - 0.80, all p < 0.05) in most outcomes (i.e., sport-specific performance; maximal dynamic strength; linear sprint; horizontal jump; reactive strength index) after PJT. The contrast of pre-PHV with post-PHV youth revealed that PJT was similarly effective in both maturity groups, in most outcome measures except for COD speed (in favour of pre-PHV). PJT induces similar physical fitness and sport-specific performance benefits in males and females, with a minimal exercise dosage of 4 weeks (8 intervention sessions), and 92 weekly jumps. Results of this meta-analysis are based on low study heterogeneity, and low to very low certainty of evidence (GRADE analysis) for all outcomes.Compared to control participants, PJT resulted in improved maximal dynamic strength, linear sprint speed, horizontal jump performance, reactive strength index, and sport-specific performance (i.e., soccer ball kicking and dribbling velocity). These effects seem to occur independently of the maturity status, as both pre-PHV and post-PHV participants achieved similar improvements after PJT interventions for most outcomes. However, several methodological issues (e.g., low sample sizes and the pooling of maturity categories) preclude the attainment of more robust recommendations at the current time. To address this issue, consistency in maturity status reporting strategies must be improved in future studies with the general youth population and youth athletes.",1

"The influence of athletic background, lower limb dominance and cutting angle on the center of mass kinematics during a sidestep cutting task",2023-04-10,2023,Brazilian Journal for Motor Behavior,Brazilian Journal of Motor Behavior,"Bruno L. S. Bedo, Guilherme M. Cesar, Wodyson T. E. Soares, Danilo S. Catelli, João B. Marques, Matheus M. Gomes, Paulo R. P. Santiago","BACKGROUND: Successful performance in futsal depends on athletes' ability to change direction efficiently. AIM: To investigate the effect of athletic background on COM kinematics during sidestep cutting maneuver performed at different cutting angles towards both sides. METHOD: Eighteen futsal athletes participated, comprised of nine high-level training (Group high-level) and nine recreational (Group Control, GC). Twenty reflective markers were placed on the participant's trunk and upper and lower limbs. Participants performed acceleration at maximum speed and in a straight line for 10 meters, followed by a change of direction (30º, 60º, and 90º). The whole body's COM trajectory was identified using a body model for each trial. Differences in angular error and COM speed were evaluated with a three-way analysis of variance [Group (GH vs. GC) X Cutting angle (30º vs. 60º vs. 90º) X Side (dominant and non-dominant), with repeated measures for the last two factors]. RESULTS: The main results indicated that the angular error increased as the cutting angle increased. The high-level futsal athletes performed a cutting task for the dominant side with greater speed and higher angular errors than the control group. These findings provided important information for understanding the trajectory of the center of mass at different angles and velocities and the possible repercussions on body dynamics. CONCLUSION: Athletic background affected the kinematic patterns of the center of mass during sidestep cutting maneuvers; when sidestep is performed with the dominant side, high-level futsal athletes changed direction faster with more significant angular error than recreational athletes.",1
Training for “Worst-Case” Scenarios in Sidestepping: Unifying Strength and Conditioning and Perception–Action Approaches,2023-04-05,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Daniel Kadlec, Matt Miller-Dicks, Sophia Nimphius","Abstract Sidesteps can impose high demands on the knee joint and lead to non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Understanding how different constraints shape an athlete’s movement strategy and the associated joint demands can help design training interventions to increase injury resilience. Motor capacities, such as muscular strength and power, act as boundaries for the safe execution of perceptual–motor skills and co-determine the emergence of unique movement strategies. Increasing single- and multi-joint strength enables a broader solution space for movement strategies and increases load tolerance. Manipulating task constraints during sidesteps can be used in the training process to systematically expose athletes to increasing demands (on the knee joint or any joint or structure) in preparation for “worst-case” scenarios. In particular, the type and timing of information available influence the preparation time, subsequently affecting the movement strategy and the associated magnitude of external knee joint loading (e.g., knee valgus moment). While an athlete’s perceptual–cognitive skills contribute to the preparation time during in situ scenarios, attempts to further improve those skills with the aim of increasing athlete preparation time prior to “worst-case” scenarios are yet to demonstrate conclusive evidence of transfer to on-field situations. Therefore, in the current article, we reflect on the impact of different interacting constraints that influence the execution of sidesteps during in situ scenarios and impose high demands on the knee joint. Subsequently, we discuss how an integrated perspective, drawing on knowledge and perspectives from strength and conditioning and perception–action, may enhance an athlete’s ability to withstand “worst-case” scenarios and adapt to perform varied movement executions when sidestepping.",1

Experimental and Finite Element Investigations on the Biomechanical Consequences of Meniscectomies in the Knee Joint: A Narrative Review,2023-04-05,2023,Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.,The Open Biomedical Engineering Journal,"Ashwin Kumar Devaraj, Kiran Kumar V. Acharya, Raviraja Adhikari","Background: The knowledge of the complex biomechanical behaviour of the meniscectomised knee joints is of paramount importance in various clinical situations. A combined review of experimental and finite element analysis studies examining the consequences of meniscectomies on the biomechanics of the knee joint has not been reported in the literature. Therefore, this paper presents a combined review of experimental and finite element analysis studies on the biomechanical consequences of medial and lateral meniscectomies in the knee joint. Methods: Experimental and FEA investigations on the association between meniscectomies and the biomechanical response of the knee joint are reviewed. The effects of partial and total meniscectomies in the medial and lateral compartments are included in this paper. Results: Subtotal/total medial meniscectomies cause a significant decrease in the contact area and a substantial increase in the contact stress in comparison with that in an intact knee joint. This could give rise to severe degeneration of the cartilage surface. Partial medial meniscectomy causes a modest reduction in the contact area associated with a moderate increase in contact stress. The resection of both leaflets of the meniscus results in a substantial increase in the contact pressure and a significant reduction in contact area compared with inferior leaflet resection. Conclusion: This review recommends partial medial meniscectomy over subtotal/ total medial meniscectomy. It also suggests performing resection of the inferior leaflet rather than resection of both the leaflets. Finally, some recommendations for future work are suggested to predict the realistic biomechanical behaviour of meniscectomised knee joints.",1

The experimental group performed the 11 + program for 8 weeks and the control group did their warm-up program. The kinematic variable in a cutting maneuver was measured using VICON motion analysis and ankle and knees’ proprioception by joint position sense (JPS) was measured using a digital inclinometer. For kinematic variables only significant differences in knee valgus among females 11 + compared with female and male control groups were found ( P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there were significant improvements in joint position sense variables in 11 + groups compared to control groups ( P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the 11 + program was proven to be a useful warm-up protocol in improving knee valgus and JPS among female and male adolescent soccer players. We suggest adding more training elements to the 11 + program that aimed to enhance the proper alignment of lower extremities which may consequently improve joint kinematics.",1
Effect of Heading a Soccer Ball as an External Focus During a Drop Vertical Jump Task,2023-04-01,2023,SAGE Publications,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,"Hadi Akbari, Satoshi Kuwano, Yohei Shimokochi","Research has demonstrated that performing a secondary task during a drop vertical jump (DVJ) may affect landing kinetics and kinematics.To examine the differences in the trunk and lower extremity biomechanics associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors between a standard DVJ and a DVJ while heading a soccer ball (header DVJ).Descriptive laboratory study.Participants comprised 24 college-level soccer players (18 female and 6 male; mean ± SD age, 20.04 ± 1.12 years; height, 165.75 ± 7.25 cm; weight, 60.95 ± 8.47 kg). Each participant completed a standard DVJ and a header DVJ, and biomechanics were recorded using an electromagnetic tracking system and force plate. The difference (Δ) in 3-dimensional trunk, hip, knee, and ankle biomechanics between the tasks was analyzed. In addition, for each biomechanical variable, the correlation between the data from the 2 tasks was calculated.Compared to the standard DVJ, performing the header DVJ led to significantly reduced peak knee flexion angle (Δ = 5.35°; P = .002), knee flexion displacement (Δ = 3.89°; P = .015), hip flexion angle at initial contact (Δ = -2.84°; P = .001), peak trunk flexion angle (Δ = 13.11°; P = .006), and center of mass vertical displacement (Δ = -0.02m; P = .010), and increased peak anterior tibial shear force (Δ = -0.72 N/kg; P = .020), trunk lateral flexion angle at initial contact (Δ = 1.55°; P < .0001), peak trunk lateral flexion angle (Δ = 1.34°; P = .003), knee joint stiffness (Δ = 0.002 N*m/kg/deg; P = .017), and leg stiffness (Δ = 8.46 N/kg/m; P = .046) compared to those in standard DVJs. In addition, individuals' data for these variables were highly and positively correlated between conditions (r = 0.632-0.908; P < .001).The header DVJ task showed kinetic and kinematic parameters that suggested increased risk of ACL injury as compared with the standard DVJ task.Athletes may benefit from acquiring the ability to safely perform header DVJs to prevent ACL injury. To simulate real-time competition situations, coaches and athletic trainers should incorporate such dual tasks in ACL injury prevention programs.",1
Association between internal load responses and recovery ability in U19 professional soccer players: A machine learning approach,2023-04-01,2023,Elsevier BV,Heliyon,"Guglielmo Pillitteri, Alessio Rossi, Carlo Simonelli, Ignazio Leale, Valerio Giustino, Giuseppe Battaglia","BackgroundThe objective of soccer training load (TL) is enhancing players' performance while minimizing the possible negative effects induced by fatigue. In this regard, monitoring workloads and recovery is necessary to avoid overload and injuries. Given the controversial results found in literature, this study aims to better understand the complex relationship between internal training load (IL) by using rating of perceived exertion (RPE), recovery, and availability (i.e., subjective players' readiness status).MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, twenty-two-professional soccer players (age: 18.5 ± 0.4 years, height: 177 ± 6 cm, weight: 67 ± 6.7 kg) competing in the U19 Italian Championship were monitored using RPE scale to assess IL, and TreS scale to detect information about recovery and training/match availability during an entire season (2021–2022).ResultsAutocorrelation analysis showed a repeated pattern with 7 days lag (weekly microcycle pattern) for all the variables considered (i.e., TL, recovery, and availability). For recovery (r = 0.64, p < 0.001) and availability (r = 0.63, p < 0.001) the best lag for both of them is 1 day. It indicates that recovery and availability are related to the past day value. Moreover, TL was found to be negatively affected by recovery and availability of the current day (lag = 0 day). Cross-correlation analysis indicates that TL is negatively affected by recovery (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and availability (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) of the current day (lag = 0 day). In particular, lower recovery and availability will result in following lower TL. Furthermore, we found that TL negatively affects recovery (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) and availability (r = 0.39, p < 0.01) of the next day (lag = 1 day). In fact, the higher the TL in a current day is, the lower the recovery and availability in the next day will be.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study highlights that there is a relationship between TL and recovery and that these components influence each other both on the same day and on the next one. The use of RPE and TreS scale to evaluate TL and recovery/availability of players allows practitioners to better adjust and schedule training within the microcycle to enhance performance while reducing injury risk.",1
Developmental stage and lower quadriceps flexibilities and decreased gastrocnemius flexibilities are predictive risk factors for developing Osgood–Schlatter disease in adolescent male soccer players,2023-03-31,2023,Wiley,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","Seira Takei, Suguru Torii, Shuji Taketomi, Satoshi Iizuka, Michio Tojima, Soichiro Iwanuma, Yukako Iida, Sakae Tanaka","This study aimed to elucidate the influential predictive risk factors of Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) on the support (non-kicking) leg among adolescent soccer players considering peak height velocity (PHV) age and investigate the cut-off values of the predictive variables.A cohort of 302 Japanese adolescent male soccer players aged 12-13 years were followed over 6 months. All players underwent physical examination, tibial tubercle ultrasonography, anthropometric and whole-body composition measurements, and muscle flexibility test of the support leg at the baseline. The developmental stage was evaluated from the PHV age. The OSD of the support leg was diagnosed 6 months later; players were divided into the OSD and control (CON) groups. The predictive risk factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.There were 42 players who had developed OSD at baseline and they were excluded from the study. Among the 209 players, 43 and 166 belonged to the OSD and CON groups, respectively. The predictive risk factors of OSD development were PHV age ± 6 months at baseline (p = 0.046), apophyseal stage of tibial tuberosity maturity at baseline (p < 0.001), quadriceps flexibility ≥ 35° at baseline (p = 0.017), and decrease in gastrocnemius flexibility in 6 months (p = 0.009).PHV age ± 6 months at baseline, apophyseal stage of the tibial tuberosity at baseline, quadriceps flexibility ≥ 35° at baseline, and decrease in gastrocnemius flexibility in 6 months are predictive risk factors of OSD development in the support leg among adolescent male soccer players. It is crucial to know the PHV age of each player, and not only the flexibility of quadriceps muscle but also the gastrocnemius should be monitored to predict OSD.II.",1

Machine Learning on Prediction of Relative Physical Activity Intensity Using Medical Radar Sensor and 3D Accelerometer,2023-03-30,2023,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Attila Biró, Sándor Miklós Szilágyi, László Szilágyi, Jaime Martín-Martín, Antonio Ignacio Cuesta-Vargas","One of the most critical topics in sports safety today is the reduction in injury risks through controlled fatigue using non-invasive athlete monitoring. Due to the risk of injuries, it is prohibited to use accelerometer-based smart trackers, activity measurement bracelets, and smart watches for recording health parameters during performance sports activities. This study analyzes the synergy feasibility of medical radar sensors and tri-axial acceleration sensor data to predict physical activity key performance indexes in performance sports by using machine learning (ML). The novelty of this method is that it uses a 24 GHz Doppler radar sensor to detect vital signs such as the heartbeat and breathing without touching the person and to predict the intensity of physical activity, combined with the acceleration data from 3D accelerometers.This study is based on the data collected from professional athletes and freely available datasets created for research purposes. A combination of sensor data management was used: a medical radar sensor with no-contact remote sensing to measure the heart rate (HR) and 3D acceleration to measure the velocity of the activity. Various advanced ML methods and models were employed on the top of sensors to analyze the vital parameters and predict the health activity key performance indexes. three-axial acceleration, heart rate data, age, as well as activity level variances.The ML models recognized the physical activity intensity and estimated the energy expenditure on a realistic level. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation (CV), as well as out-of-sample testing (OST) methods, have been used to evaluate the level of accuracy in activity intensity prediction. The energy expenditure prediction with three-axial accelerometer sensors by using linear regression provided 97-99% accuracy on selected sports (cycling, running, and soccer). The ML-based RPE results using medical radar sensors on a time-series heart rate (HR) dataset varied between 90 and 96% accuracy. The expected level of accuracy was examined with different models. The average accuracy for all the models (RPE and METs) and setups was higher than 90%.The ML models that classify the rating of the perceived exertion and the metabolic equivalent of tasks perform consistently.",1
Topical cannabidiol is well tolerated in individuals with a history of elite physical performance and chronic lower extremity pain,2023-03-30,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Cannabis Research,"Nicole Hall, Bradie James, Mohammad Alfrad Nobel Bhuiyan, Erin Crane, Carlie Falgout, Kevin Sean Murnane","Abstract Introduction Cannabidiol (CBD) is a potential therapeutic for pain management. Yet, there exists a dearth of studies of its tolerability and efficacy, especially in special populations. Former elite athletes are a special population both susceptible to chronic pain and also highly trained and attuned to assess medication tolerability concerns. The purpose of the present open-label pilot study was to assess the tolerability of CBD in this population. Materials and methods Retrospective analysis was conducted in deidentified data from 20 individuals who were all previously professional athletes in US/American football, track and field, or basketball, with careers ranging from 4 to 10 years. Participants received topical CBD (10 mg twice daily by controlled dispenser) for chronic pain resulting from acute lower extremity injuries. Assessments of tolerability and secondary analyses of pain, pain-related disability, and activities of daily living were collected by self-report over the 6-week study period. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, pairwise t -test, and linear regression. Results Seventy percent of participants completed the study. Of the individuals who completed the study, 50% reported minor adverse effects, none of which required medical attention, and 50% did not report any adverse effects. The mostly commonly reported effects were skin dryness (43% of study completers) and skin rash (21% of study completers), which rapidly resolved. There was a significant improvement in self-reported pain levels (intake mean 3.5 ± 0.29; exit mean 1.7 ± 0.23; P &lt; 0.001) and pain-related disability, including family and home responsibilities, life support activities, occupational activities, recreational activities, self-care, sexual function, and social activities (all P &lt; 0.001). Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess CBD treatment in elite athletes, who are disproportionally susceptible to disabling injuries. Topical administration of CBD was tolerated well by this population and resulted in only minor adverse effects. As elite athletes are trained and attuned to assess their own bodies due to their professional lives, this population is likely to detect tolerability concerns. However, this study was limited to a convenience sample and self-reported data. These pilot findings warrant further study of topical CBD in randomized and controlled studies of elite athletes.",1
Pathological Findings in Male and Female Semi-Professional Football Players from 11 to 14 Years—A Report of the Bavarian Football Association’s Pre-Participation Screening Program,2023-03-30,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Clemens Memmel, Lisa Lehner, Oliver Loose, Christian Gündisch, Volker Krutsch, Lorenz Huber, Volker Alt, Werner Krutsch, Stephan Gerling","Pre-participation screening (PPS) in professional junior football is common practice. However, football players (FP) from non-professional football clubs may also be exposed to health risks, both internal and musculoskeletal. Therefore, the Bavarian Football Association (BFV) implemented a cardiological and orthopedic screening program for semi-professional FP in 2014. The purpose of this study was to obtain and present epidemiological data of pre-adolescent and adolescent semi-professional FP, including cardiac pathologies, past injuries, and orthopedic disorders. This study represents a retrospective analysis of semi-professional FP aged 11 to 14 years participating in the PPS program from 2014 to 2018, including their medical history, cardiac risk profiles, and the results of undergoing orthopedic and sports cardiology examinations. Overall, 362 male and 162 female FP could be included. More than 20% of the FP indicated suffering from one or more medical conditions. Cardiac abnormalities were reported in 30 (5.7%) FP. Further cardiological diagnostics were recommended for 3% of the FP due to findings while undergoing the PPS. Orthopedic disorders could be detected in 51 (9.7%) FP. Of the reported injuries, 44.3% could be categorized as overuse injuries. In order to guarantee extensive preventive sports medical care for semi-professional junior FP, a PPS concept should include a basic orthopedic examination in addition to cardiological screening due to a high rate of overuse injuries and cardiac abnormalities among pre-adolescent and adolescent FP. Further studies are needed in junior football to gain epidemiological data on injury occurrence and cardiac abnormalities on an amateur level to evaluate possible PPS programs, even on an amateur level.",1

Video analysis of Achilles tendon ruptures in professional male football (soccer) reveals underlying injury patterns and provides strategies for injury prevention,2023-03-28,2023,Wiley,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","Tim Hoenig, Thomas Gronwald, Karsten Hollander, Christian Klein, Karl‐Heinz Frosch, Peter Ueblacker, Tim Rolvien","In professional football (soccer), Achilles tendon ruptures are severe injuries. Video analysis promotes a better understanding of the underlying situational and biomechanical patterns, and provides a roadmap for future research to improve the management and prevention of Achilles tendon ruptures. The purpose of this study was to identify injury patterns contributing to acute Achilles tendon ruptures in professional male football players.Professional male football players with an acute Achilles tendon rupture were identified using an online database. For every in-competition injury, the corresponding football match was detected. Video footage of the injury was accessed using Wyscout.com or publicly available video databases. Situational patterns and injury biomechanics of the injury frame were independently analysed by two reviewers using a standardised checklist and a motion analysis software. Finally, consensus was reached to describe the main injury patterns of Achilles tendon ruptures in professional male football players.The search identified video footage of 80 Achilles tendon ruptures in 78 players. Most injuries (94%) occurred through indirect or non-contact mechanisms. The kinematic analysis revealed characteristic joint positions at the time of injury consisting of hip extension, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, foot abduction, and foot pronation in most cases. The underlying direction of movement was from flexion to extension (knee) and from plantarflexion to dorsiflexion (ankle). Player actions identified as main injury patterns were stepping back (26%), landing (20%), running/sprinting (18%), jumping (13%), and starting (10%).Most Achilles tendon ruptures in professional male football players are closed-chain indirect or non-contact injuries. Sudden loading to the plantarflexor musculotendinous unit remains to be the main component for most cases. By achieving a better understanding of underlying injury mechanisms, this study provides new strategies for the prevention of Achilles tendon ruptures.Level IV.",1

The present study aimed at determining the prevalence of MSPs with regard to sport disciplines and athletic status.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 320 Senegalese professional and amateur athletes practicing football, basketball, rugby, tennis, athletics, and wrestling. Rates of MSPs in the past year (MSPs-12) and week (MSPs-7d) were assessed using standard questionnaires.Overall proportions of MSPs-12 and MSPs-7d were 70 and 74.2%, respectively. MSPs-12 were more frequently reported on shoulders (40.6%), neck (37.1%) and hips/thigh (34.4%), while MSPs-7d were predominant on hips/thigh (29.5%), shoulders (25.7%), and upper back (17.2%). Proportions of MSPs-12 and MSPs-7d varied significantly by sport disciplines, with highest values among basketball players. Again, highest MSPs-12 proportions on shoulders (29.7%, P = 0.02), wrists/hands (34.6%, P = 0.001), (40.2%, P = 0.0002), and knees (38.8%, P = 0.002) were seen among basketball players. High proportions of MSPs-7d were seen on shoulders (29.6%, P = 0.04) for tennis players, wrists/hands (29.4%, P = 0.03) for basketball and football players, and hips/thigh (38.8%, P < 0.00001) for basketball players. Football players had reduced risk of MSPs-12 by 75% on lower back (OR = 0.25; 95% CI. 0.10-0.63; P = 0.003) and by 72% on knees (OR = 0.28; 95% CI. 0.08-0. 95; P = 0.04).

Professionals were protected from MSPs-12 on neck pain with a significant reduction of risk by 61% (OR = 0.39, 95% CI. 0.21-0.75, P = 0.03).MSPs are a reality among athletes and their risk is modulated by sport disciplines, athletic status and gender.",1
Effect of IMU location on estimation of vertical ground reaction force during jumping,2023-03-20,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Jordan A. Kerns, Andrew S. Zwart, Pietro S. Perez, Reed D. Gurchiek, Jeffrey M. McBride","Introduction: Several investigations have examined utilizing inertial measurement units (IMU) to estimate ground reaction force (GRF) during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of inertial measurement units location on the estimation of ground reaction force during vertical jumping. Methods: Eight male subjects completed a series of ten countermovement jumps on a force plate (FP). The subjects had an inertial measurement units attached to the sacrum, back and chest. Ground reaction force was estimated from data from the individual inertial measurement units and by using a two-segment model and combined sensor approach. Results: The peak ground reaction force values for the sacrum, back, chest and combined inertial measurement units were 1,792 ± 278 N, 1,850 ± 341 N, 2,054 ± 346 N and 1,812 ± 323 N, respectively. The sacral inertial measurement units achieved the smallest differences for ground reaction force estimates providing a root mean square error (RMSE) between 88 N and 360 N. The inertial measurement units on the sacrum also showed significant correlations in peak ground reaction force ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) and average ground reaction force ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) using the Bland-Altman 95% Limits of Agreement (LOA) when in comparison to the force plate. Discussion: Based on assessment of bias, Limits of Agreement, and RMSE, the inertial measurement units located on the sacrum appears to be the best placement to estimate both peak and average ground reaction force during jumping.",1

Material and methods: Male collegiate athletes (n=24, age=18.46±1.14 years, weight=64.88±5.61 kg and height=1.72±0.07 metres)) from a physical training centre were randomly and equally assigned to three groups, each trained on different surfaces (synthetic, cinder and sand). The training intervention was implemented twice a week and lasted for 8 weeks. The athletes were tested before and after the intervention to assess changes in the performance of counter movement jump height (CMJHT), take-off force (CMJTOF) and maximum concentric power (CMJMCP). Results: Results showed that overall measurement of CMJHT, CMJTOF and CMJMCP improved significantly (p≤0.05, Δ %=10.50; p≤0.05, Δ%=11.11; p≤0.05, Δ%=11.41). However, training surfaces have no significant effect on the improvement of the selected variables (CMJHT:F(2,21)=2.37, p=0.118, ηp2=0.184; CMJTOF:F(2,21)=1.28, p=0.299, ηp2=0.109; CMJMCP:F(2,21)=0.061, p=0.941, ηp2=0.006). Further, for the synthetic track surface group CMJHT, CMJTOF and CMJMCP improved significantly (p≤0.05, Δ%=16.36; p≤0.05, Δ%=17.50; p≤0.05, Δ%=17.99); for the cinder track surface group CMJHT and CMJMCP improved significantly (p≤0.05, Δ%=9.15; p≤0.05, Δ%=10.33) and for the sand surface group only CMJHT improved significantly (p≤0.05, Δ%=5.68). Conclusions: The findings suggest that plyometric training on different surfaces can effectively improve athletic performance, but the specific surface type does not appear to impact the outcomes significantly. The study further suggested analysing the injury risk associated with plyometric training on various training surfaces and discovering the optimal training surface for minimising injury risk while maximising performance gains.",1
In-field assessment of change-of-direction ability with a single wearable sensor,2023-03-18,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Salil Apte, Hojjat Karami, Célestin Vallat, Vincent Gremeaux, Kamiar Aminian","The Agility T-test is a standardized method to measure the change-of-direction (COD) ability of athletes in the field. It is traditionally scored based on the total completion time, which does not provide information on the different CODs. Augmenting the T-test with wearable sensors provides the opportunity to explore new metrics. Towards this, data of 23 professional soccer players were recorded with a trunk-worn GNSS-IMU (Global Navigation Satellite System-Inertial Measurement Unit) device. A method for detecting the four CODs based on the wavelet-denoised antero-posterior acceleration signal was developed and validated using video data (60 Hz). Following this, completion time was estimated using GNSS ground speed and validated with the photocell data. The proposed method yields an error (mean ± standard deviation) of 0 ± 66 ms for the COD detection, - 0.16 ± 0.22 s for completion time, and a relative error for each COD duration and each sequential movement durations of less than 3.5 ± 16% and 7 ± 7%, respectively. The presented algorithm can highlight the asymmetric performance between the phases and CODs in the right and left direction. By providing a more comprehensive analysis in the field, this work can enable coaches to develop more personalized training and rehabilitation programs.",1

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a novel CKC supination-style ankle strengthening program to a traditional ankle strengthening program on common LAS indices. Methods: Thirty NCAA Division III collegiate football players (19.9±1.0yrs., 182.2±6.9cm, 98.8±18.0kg) were randomly assigned to a novel exercise (SUP, n = 16) or traditional exercise group (TRA, n = 14). The SUP group performed dynamic bodyweight exercises with controlled ankle supination while the TRA group performed traditional ankle strengthening exercise using elastic bands and stability exercises 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Right and left ankle inversion (InvR, InvL) and eversion (EvR, EvL) strength (kg), ankle inversion range of motion (romR, romL) (deg.), and figure-8 hop test (fig8R, fig8L) (s) performance were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in all outcome measures pre- to post-test (ΔInvR: TRA 4.5±4.3kg, SUP 5.0±4.4kg; ΔIvL: TRA 4.0±3.8kg, SUP 4.8±3.6kg; ΔEvR: TRA 5.7±4.3kg, SUP 4.7±3.3kg; ΔEvL: TRA 4.7±2.9kg, SUP 4.5±2.2kg; ΔromR: TRA 4.5±2.6°, SUP 4.9±3.0°; ΔromL: TRA 4.7±4.5°, SUP 4.6±5.1°; Δfig8R: TRA -0.43±0.20s, SUP -0.37±0.31s; Δfig8L: TRA -0.40±0.22s, SUP -0.34±0.30s; p’s&lt;0.001), with no difference between groups. Conclusions: A bodyweight, supination style ankle training program can improve physical qualities related to LAS to a similar extent as a traditional program, and therefore, could potentially be a viable alternative strategy for reducing LAS in Division III NCAA football players.",1
Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and landing postures during a soccer-specific task,2023-03-16,2023,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Hadi Akbari, Yohei Shimokochi, Bahram Sheikhi","Introduction Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (DF-ROM) has been shown to be associated with poor landing posture. However, previously used tasks have been controlled, and it is unclear whether clinical measurements of the ankle DF-ROM, are associated with landing positions during sport-specific task. This study sought to determine the relationship between ankle DF-ROM and landing positions. Methods Thirty male soccer players participated in this study. The ankle DF-ROM was measured by the weight bearing lunge test in degrees using a cell phone app (TiltMeter). Landing patterns were assessed during a soccer-specific task using landing error scoring system items using Kinovea software. Simple correlations were used to evaluate the relationships between ankle DF-ROM and landing error scores. Results Significant correlations were found between ankle DF-ROM and landing errors ( r = -0.450, P = 0.006). A decreased ankle DF-ROM was associated with greater landing errors in a soccer specific situation. Conclusion These results suggest that ankle DF-ROM may serve a useful clinical measure for identifying poor landing posture in the real-world environment. Therefore, assessment of ankle DF-ROM could be included in the screening process, which could help identify the cause of the faulty motion.",1
"Patellofemoral Pain, Q-Angle, and Performance in Female Chinese Collegiate Soccer Players",2023-03-16,2023,MDPI AG,Medicina,"Songhui You, Yinhao Shen, Qingguang Liu, Antonio Cicchella","Background and objective: Female sports injuries have been neglected by science, and few relevant studies have considered female subjects. Knee pain in female soccer players is more common than in male soccer players. The number of days of absence from training and competition has been shown to be higher in females than males. The reporting of knee pain is common in female soccer players, but whether knee pain is associated with morphological features is unclear. The Q-angle of the knee has been hypothesized to be a causal factor in knee pain. Asian females have shown higher levels of valgus than non-sporting Caucasian populations, but no data exist for female Chinese players. The aim of our study was to investigate whether there are associations between knee pain, the Q-angle of the lower limb, jump performance, play time, and perceived exertion in female Chinese collegiate soccer players. Materials and Methods: We measured the Q-angle, patellofemoral/anterior knee pain (SNAPPS questionnaire), and CMJ and SJ performance of 21 subjects (age: 20.09 ± 1.13 years, weight: 56.9 ± 6.26 kg, height: 164.24 ± 4.48 cm, and >10 years of practice) before and after a match; Borg scale and play time results were also recorded. Results: We found that our studied group had higher Q-angles in comparison to other ethnic groups reported in the literature, as well as an association of the Q-angle with the age, height, and weight of the players; however, contrary to other studies, we did not find any association between the Q-angle and knee pain, jumps, play time, or perceived exertion. Knee pain was not associated with any of the measured variables. Conclusions: Female Chinese soccer players showed higher Q-angles than players of other ethnic groups, a result that was associated with anthropometrics. The Q-angle was not found to be associated with knee pain, for which the sole determinant was body height.",1
Gluteal Muscle Forces during Hip-Focused Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Exercises,2023-03-15,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise,"TYLER J. COLLINGS, MATTHEW N. BOURNE, ROD S. BARRETT, EVY MEINDERS, BASíLIO A. M. GONçALVES, ANTHONY J. SHIELD, LAURA E. DIAMOND","This study aimed to compare and rank gluteal muscle forces in eight hip-focused exercises performed with and without external resistance and describe the underlying fiber lengths, velocities, and muscle activations.Motion capture, ground reaction forces, and electromyography (EMG) were used as input to an EMG-informed neuromusculoskeletal model to estimate gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus muscle forces. Participants were 14 female footballers (18-32 yr old) with at least 3 months of lower limb strength training experience. Each participant performed eight hip-focused exercises (single-leg squat, split squat, single-leg Romanian deadlift [RDL], single-leg hip thrust, banded side step, hip hike, side plank, and side-lying leg raise) with and without 12 repetition maximum (RM) resistance. For each muscle, exercises were ranked by peak muscle force, and k-means clustering separated exercises into four tiers.The tier 1 exercises for gluteus maximus were loaded split squat (95% confidence interval [CI] = 495-688 N), loaded single-leg RDL (95% CI = 500-655 N), and loaded single-leg hip thrust (95% CI = 505-640 N). The tier 1 exercises for gluteus medius were body weight side plank (95% CI = 338-483 N), loaded single-leg squat (95% CI = 278-422 N), and loaded single-leg RDL (95% CI = 283-405 N). The tier 1 exercises for gluteus minimus were loaded single-leg RDL (95% CI = 267-389 N) and body weight side plank (95% CI = 272-382 N). Peak gluteal muscle forces increased by 28-150 N when exercises were performed with 12RM external resistance compared with body weight only. Peak muscle force coincided with maximum fiber length for most exercises.Gluteal muscle forces were exercise specific, and peak muscle forces increased by varying amounts when adding a 12RM external resistance. These findings may inform exercise selection by facilitating the targeting of individual gluteal muscles and optimization of mechanical loads to match performance, injury prevention, or rehabilitation training goals.",1
Machine-learning-based head impact subtyping based on the spectral densities of the measurable head kinematics,2023-03-13,2023,Elsevier BV,Journal of Sport and Health Science,"Xianghao Zhan, Yiheng Li, Yuzhe Liu, Nicholas J. Cecchi, Samuel J. Raymond, Zhou Zhou, Hossein Vahid Alizadeh, Jesse Ruan, Saeed Barbat, Stephen Tiernan, Olivier Gevaert, Michael M. Zeineh, Gerald A. Grant, David B. Camarillo","Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head impacts, but many brain injury risk estimation models are not equally accurate across the variety of impacts that patients may undergo, and the characteristics of different types of impacts are not well studied. We investigated the spectral characteristics of different head impact types with kinematics classification.Data were analyzed from 3262 head impacts from lab reconstruction, American football, mixed martial arts, and publicly available car crash data. A random forest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angular velocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football, car crash, mixed martial arts). To test the classifier robustness, another 271 lab-reconstructed impacts were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards. Finally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models were built for brain strain.The classifier reached a median accuracy of 96% over 1000 random partitions of training and test sets. The most important features in the classification included both low- and high-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocity features. Different head impact types had different distributions of spectral densities in low- and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral densities of mixed martial arts impacts were higher in the high-frequency range than in the low-frequency range). The type-specific regression showed a generally higher R2 value than baseline models without classification.The machine-learning-based classifier enables a better understanding of the impact kinematics spectral density in different sports, and it can be applied to evaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems and on-field data augmentation.",1
Should We Use the Men Load–Velocity Profile for Women in Deadlift and Hip Thrust?,2023-03-10,2023,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Raúl Nieto-Acevedo, Blanca Romero-Moraleda, Almudena Montalvo-Pérez, Agustín Valdés-Álvarez, Carlos García-Sánchez, Daniel Mon-López","Injuries are common in team sports and can impact both team and individual performance. In particular, hamstring strain injuries are some of the most common injuries. Furthermore, hamstring injury ratios, in number of injuries and total absence days, have doubled in the last 21 seasons in professional soccer. Weakness in hip extensor strength has been identified as a risk factor in elite-level sprinters. In addition, strength imbalances of the hamstring muscle group seem to be a common cause of hamstring strain injuries. In this regard, velocity-based training has been proposed to analyze deficits in the force-velocity profile. Previous studies have shown differences between men and women, since there are biomechanical and neuromuscular differences in the lower limbs between sexes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the load-velocity profile between males and females during two of the most important hip extension exercises: the hip thrust and the deadlift. Sixteen men and sixteen women were measured in an incremental loading test following standard procedures for the hip thrust and deadlift exercises. Pearson's correlation (r) was used to measure the strength of the correlation between movement velocity and load (%1RM). The differences in the load-velocity relationship between the men and the women were assessed using a 2 (sex) × 15 (load) repeated-measures ANOVA. The main findings revealed that: (I) the load-velocity relationship was always strong and linear in both exercises (R2 range: 0.88-0.94), (II) men showed higher velocities for light loads (30-50%1RM; effect size: 0.9-0.96) than women for the deadlift, but no significant differences were found for the hip thrust. Based on the results of this study, the load-velocity equations seem to be sex-specific. Therefore, we suggest that using sex-specific equations to analyze deficits in the force-velocity profile would be more effective to control intensity in the deadlift exercise.",1
Secondary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Prevention Training in Athletes: What Is the Missing Link?,2023-03-09,2023,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Choi-Yan (Tiffany) Wong, Kam-Ming Mok, Shu-Hang (Patrick) Yung","After reconstruction, the return to full competition rate of athletes is low, while the re-injury rate remains high despite the completion of a rehabilitation programme. Primary ACL prevention programmes are well developed, yet few research papers focus on secondary ACL injury prevention. The aim of current review is to determine if current ACL secondary prevention training has a positive influence on the re-injury rate, the clinical or functional outcomes, or the risk of re-injury in athletes. Studies investigating secondary prevention of ACL were searched in PubMed and EBSCOhost, followed by a review of the references in the identified articles. The existing evidence suggests that neuromuscular training, eccentric strengthening, and plyometric exercises may have a potential impact on improving biomechanical, functional, and psychological outcomes in athletes; however, the studies on the prevention of second ACL injury in athletes is scarce and inconclusive. Future research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of secondary ACL prevention in reducing the re-injury rates. (PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42021291308).",1

Predictive simulation of single-leg landing scenarios for ACL injury risk factors evaluation,2023-03-09,2023,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Evgenia Moustridi, Konstantinos Risvas, Konstantinos Moustakas","The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rupture is a very common knee injury during sport activities. Landing after jump is one of the most prominent human body movements that can lead to such an injury. The landing-related ACL injury risk factors have been in the spotlight of research interest. Over the years, researchers and clinicians acquire knowledge about human movement during daily-life activities by organizing complex in vivo studies that feature high complexity, costs and technical and most importantly physical challenges. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a computational modeling and simulation pipeline that aims to predict and identify key parameters of interest that are related to ACL injury during single-leg landings. We examined the following conditions: a) landing height, b) hip internal and external rotation, c) lumbar forward and backward leaning, d) lumbar medial and lateral bending, e) muscle forces permutations and f) effort goal weight. Identified on related research studies, we evaluated the following risk factors: vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF), knee joint Anterior force (AF), Medial force (MF), Compressive force (CF), Abduction moment (AbdM), Internal rotation moment (IRM), quadricep and hamstring muscle forces and Quadriceps/Hamstrings force ratio (Q/H force ratio). Our study clearly demonstrated that ACL injury is a rather complicated mechanism with many associated risk factors which are evidently correlated. Nevertheless, the results were mostly in agreement with other research studies regarding the ACL risk factors. The presented pipeline showcased promising potential of predictive simulations to evaluate different aspects of complicated phenomena, such as the ACL injury.",1
Use of Fantasy Points in Evaluating Professional Athlete Performance After Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction,2023-03-07,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Marvin Kajy, Devan O Higginbotham, Ali Etemad-Rezaie, Guy R S Ball, Rahul Vaidya","Our aim in performing this study was to evaluate whether fantasy and wins above replacement (WAR) scores of athletes undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery in the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB) could be utilized in evaluating their performance post-surgery. We identified publicly accessible data on professional athletes from 1992 to 2015. Fantasy and WAR scores were calculated for each player. A total of 83 professional players met the inclusion criteria for this cross-sectional study. Decreased fantasy scores ranged from 33% to 42% across the four leagues after the index operation. NHL players had the lowest return-to-play (RTP) rate at 11/17 (82%), and MLB players had the highest RTP rate at 14/15 (93%). RTP rates of NBA and NFL players were comparable at 22/26 (85%) and 22/25 (88%), respectively. NFL players had the lowest average career length after surgery at 26 months, while NBA players had the longest average career length at 64 months. MLB players on average required the longest time to return to the pre-surgical level of performance (21 months). NHL players had the shortest average recovery time (eight months), and NBA players had the longest average recovery time (13 months). Approximately, more than half of all the studied players exhibited a decline in fantasy or WAR scores. In addition, NFL players had the lowest average career length, and NBA players enjoyed the longest average career length after surgery. NHL players had the lowest recovery time, while NBA players had the longest recovery time. The strength of this study is the utilization of fantasy points and WAR scores as a single unifying measure of a player's performance, which acts as an objective measure after ACL reconstruction. The average performance of a professional athlete, as evaluated through their fantasy score output, tends to decrease after undergoing ACL reconstruction. There is an overall long-term performance decline after initial spikes in their performance after surgery. Additional larger studies are needed to fully understand the effects of ACL reconstruction in professional athletes; however, the use of fantasy scores may be an objective tool in measuring the success rate of ACL reconstruction.",1

BIOLOGIC ACL REPAIR AUGMENTATION,2023-03-06,2023,"Dougmar Publishing Group, Inc.",Biologic Orthopedics Journal,"Tiago Lazzaretti Fernandes, Joao Vitor De Castro Fernandes, Sergio Ferreira Barbosa Junior, Teófilo Josué Alecrim da Costa Vieira, Arnaldo José Hernandez","The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is on the rise due to increased physical and sports activities. Thus, ACL reconstruction is a common surgical procedure to treat ACL ruptures, however, it has a failure rate of 0.7–21% and only 63% of the patients are able to recover to their pre-injury sport level. Orthobiologics, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), growth factors, and stem cells, are being explored as alternative treatment methods to maximize the results and reduce surgical morbidity and healing time. PRP is derived from a blood sample with high platelet concentration and containing growth factors and interleukins. Studies have shown that PRP can improve the maturation of ACL reconstruction but more research is required to support its use in ACL surgery. On one hand, growth factors play a crucial role in ligament healing and PRP, which contains high levels of growth factors, has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and encourage cell proliferation. On the other hand, stem cells have the ability to differentiate into other cell types and limit the inflammatory microenvironment during acute ligament injury. Ligament-derived stem cells show better potential for lineage-specific tendon/ligament differentiation when used with differentiation inducers. The use of stem cells in ACL reconstruction is still in the early stages of investigation. Therefore, cell therapy agents have shown promising results in preclinical models, but more research is required to determine the most effective biological agents for treatment.",1

E. Amzaleg, Stephen. D. Patterson, Sarah. L. Coakley","Background and aim: The study compared differences in derived critical velocity (CV) and maximal speed from the 3-Minute All-Out Shuttle Test (3MST), 7-Minute Intermittent Critical Velocity Shuttle Test (7MST) and 3-Minute All-Out Running Test (3MRT). We also determined test-retest reliability of the 3MST versus the 7MST. Methods: Eleven semi-professional football players completed 10 visits; 3 familiarisation and 7 testing sessions (3 trials for each of the 3MST and 7MST and 1 trial of the 3MRT). CV was calculated, and maximal speed was recorded via GPS. Results: CV via the 3MRT (14.17 ± 1.49 km.h-1) was faster than the 3MST (10.12 ± 0.97 km.h-1, p &lt; 0.001) and 7MST (9.03 ± 0.97 km.h-1, p &lt; 0.001), although minimal differences were observed between the 3MST and 7MST (p = 0.13). Maximal speed differed across all test modes; 3MRT (29.07 ± 2.19 km.h-1, p &lt; 0.001), 3MST (26.18 ± 1.71 km.h-1, p &lt; 0.001) and 7MST (23.14 ± 1.10 km.h-1, p &lt; 0.001). Intra-class correlation coefficient was larger for the 3MST (0.37) than the 7MST (0.05). Coefficient of variation was smaller for the 3MST (7.57%) compared to the 7MST (11.56%). Conclusions: Shuttle tests derive significantly slower CV and maximal speeds compared to linear tests and thus likely provide greater task specificity for CV modelling of team-sport athletes.",1
The Association of Trunk and Hip Kinematic With Knee Abduction Angle During Single-Leg Landing,2023-03-06,2023,Negah Scientific Publisher,Iranian Rehabilitation Journal,"Maedeh Taghizadeh Kerman, Ali Yalfani, Ahmad Ebrahimi Atri","Objectives: Children aged 10 to 12 years often show dangerous maneuvers during landing, which include increased knee valgus, placing them at higher risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The study aimed to investigate the relation of the trunk and hip kinematics with the peak knee abduction angle during single-leg landing among preadolescent female soccer players. Methods: Thirty-six preadolescent female soccer players aged 10 to 12 years attended the study. Participants did a static trial and after that performed landing trials. A single-leg landing was applied to assess the landing kinematics. A three-dimensional motion capture system was applied to analyze trunk, hip, and knee kinematics. Results: Pearson correlation coefficient demonstrated a significantly positive relationship between peak hip internal rotation angle (r=0.361) (P=0.03) and peak knee abduction angle. Furthermore, no significant relationship was identified between peak hip adduction (r=-0.102) (P=0.55), peak trunk rotation (r=0.239) (P=0.16), peak trunk lateral flexion (r=0.052) (P=0.76), and peak valgus knee. Discussion: Peak hip rotation angle was correlated with the valgus knee with a weak correlation value among preadolescent female soccer players. Future studies should consider kinematic risk factors related to ACL injuries in combination with neuromuscular control trunk and hip during more demanding tasks.",1
The Relationship between Lower Extremity Functional Performance and Balance after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Results of Patients Treated with the Modified All-Inside Technique,2023-03-02,2023,MDPI AG,Journal of Personalized Medicine,"Nizamettin Güzel, Ahmet Serhat Genç, Ali Kerim Yılmaz, Lokman Kehribar","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures are common injuries, and ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is among the most common surgical procedures in sports surgery. Our research aims to compare the 6-month post-operative results of the modified all-inside (MAI) ACLR technique, single leg hop tests (SLHT), and Y balance tests applied in different directions on the operated and non-operated sides.A retrospective cohort of 22 male recreational athletes who underwent MAI ACLR techniques performed by the same surgeon were evaluated. The functional knee strengths of the participants on the operated and non-operated sides were evaluated with five different tests of SLHTs: single hop for distance (SH), triple hop for distance (TH), crossover triple hop for distance (CH), medial side triple hop for distance (MSTH), and medial rotation (90°) with hop for distance (MRH). Their dynamic balance was evaluated with the Y balance Test.Compared to pre-operative levels, there was a significant improvement in the mean Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC scores during the post-operative period (p < 0.05). There was a difference between SH, THD, CHD, MSTH, and MRH on the operated and non-operative sides (p < 0.05). There was no difference between Y balance scores on the operated and non-operative sides, and there were no differences between LSI scores resulting from SLHTs (p > 0.05). There were no significant relationships between YBT (composite scores) and SH, TH, CH, MSTH, and MRH distances in the healthy leg (p > 0.05), but a significant correlation with only CH in the ACL leg (p < 0.05).Our research shows that sixth-month post-operative SLHT findings were lower on the ACL side compared to the healthy side in patients tested with the MAI ACLR technique. However, when these scores are evaluated in terms of balance, it can be seen that both sides reveal similar findings. The similarity of LSIs in SLHTs applied in different directions, and balance scores of ACL and healthy sides revealed that the MAI technique is also an ACLR technique that can be used in athletes from a functional point of view.",1
Diagnostics Using the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT) of the Biomechanical Patterns Associated with Knee Injury in Female Futsal Players: A Cross-Sectional Analytical Study,2023-03-01,2023,MDPI AG,Diagnostics,"Loreto Ferrández-Laliena, Lucía Vicente-Pina, Rocío Sánchez-Rodríguez, Eva Orantes-González, José Heredia-Jimenez, María Orosia Lucha-López, César Hidalgo-García, José Miguel Tricás-Moreno","The primary aim of this study was to identify kinematic differences at initial contact between female futsal players with and without previous knee injury, using a functional motor pattern test. The secondary aim was to determine kinematic differences between the dominant and non-dominant limb in the whole group, using the same test. A cross-sectional study was performed in 16 female futsal players allocated into two groups: eight females with a previous knee injury, i.e., affected by the valgus collapse mechanism without surgical intervention, and eight with no previous injury. The evaluation protocol included the change-of-direction and acceleration test (CODAT). One registration was made for each lower limb, i.e., the dominant (the preferred kicking limb) and non-dominant limb. A 3D motion capture system (Qualisys AB, Göteborg, Sweden) was used to analyze the kinematics. The Cohen’s d effect sizes between the groups demonstrated a strong effect size towards more physiological positions in the non-injured group in the following kinematics in the dominant limb: hip adduction (Cohen’s d = 0.82), hip internal rotation (Cohen’s d = 0.88), and ipsilateral pelvis rotation (Cohen’s d = 1.06). The t-test for the dominant and non-dominant limb in the whole group showed the following differences in knee valgus: dominant limb (9.02 ± 7.31 degrees) and non-dominant limb (1.27 ± 9.05 degrees) (p = 0.049). Conclusions: The players with no previous history of knee injury had a more physiological position for avoiding the valgus collapse mechanism in the hip adduction and internal rotation, and in the pelvis rotation in the dominant limb. All the players showed more knee valgus in the dominant limb, which is the limb at greater risk of injury.",1
The effect of using exercises with auxiliary tools for unstable jumping on the balance of strength and explosive ability of the muscles of the two legs of football players under 19 years old,2023-03-01,2023,AkiNik Publications,"International Journal of Physical Education, Sports and Health","Arkan Hasan Jabar, Ali Naeem Ajeel","The purpose of this paper was to preparing exercises with auxiliary tools for unstable jumping in the balance of strength and explosive ability of the muscles of the two legs for football players under 19 years old, and to identify the effect of exercises with auxiliary tools for unstable jumping on the balance of strength and explosive ability of the muscles of the two legs of football players under 19 years old. The researchers used the experimental method in a single interrelated sample method, due to its suitability to the nature of the problem and the objectives of the research. The researchers selected the research community from the players of the second-class clubs in Wasit Governorate, and the research sample was deliberately chosen from the research community, which is the players of Al-Kut Sports Club, and 10 players from the club were chosen to apply the research procedures to them as well as the experiment, and the goalkeepers were excluded from participating in the training. One of the most important results reached by the researcher is that: Strength training with unbalanced tools contributed to the development of the variables of force balance and explosive power, unbalanced strength training has a significant impact on strengthening the neuromuscular reflexes of the muscles surrounding the ankle joint, and training with unbalanced jumping exercises mobilizes the largest amount of muscle fibers to give a high explosive character. One of the most important recommendations recommended by the researchers is that: Emphasis on the use of these exercises to give the players an explosive and effective character, use of these exercises as strength exercises and preventive injuries of the ankle joint, and work on the inclusion of exercises similar to non-sports games that use the explosive character in their movements.",1

Design: Descriptive case series study of consecutive RF injuries from November 2017 to July 2022. Setting: Two specialized sports medicine hospitals. Participants: Professional male soccer players aged between 18 and 40 years, referred for injury assessment within 7 days after a RF injury, with an available video footage of the injury and a positive finding on an MRI. Independent Variables: Rectus femoris injury mechanisms (specific scoring based on standardized models) in relation to RF muscle injury MRI findings. Main Outcome Measures: Rectus femoris injury mechanism (playing situation, player/opponent behavior, movement, and biomechanics), location of injury in MRI. Results: Twenty videos of RF injuries in 19 professional male soccer players were analyzed. Three different injury mechanisms were seen: kicking (80%), sprinting (10%), and change of direction (10%). Isolated single-tendon injuries were found in 60% of the injuries. Of the kicking injuries, 62.5% included complete tendon ruptures, whereas both running injuries and none of the change of direction injuries were complete ruptures. The direct tendon was involved in 33% of the isolated injuries, and the common tendon was affected in all combined injuries. Conclusions: Rectus femoris injuries typically occur during kicking among football players. Most of the RF injuries involve a complete rupture of at least one tendon. Kicking injuries can also affect the supporting leg, and sprinting can cause a complete tendon rupture, whereas change of direction seems not to lead to complete ruptures.",1

One key finding is the specific and sensitive role of reactance (Xc), measured at 50 kHz with a phase-sensitive BI instrument, to identify objective degrees of muscle injury, localized structural damage and fluid accretion, determined using magnetic resonance imaging. The predominant effect of Xc as an indicator of severity of muscle injury is highlighted in phase angle (PhA) measurements. Novel experimental models utilizing cooking-induced cell disruption, saline injection into meat specimens, and measurements of changing amounts of cells in a constant volume provide empirical evidence of the physiological correlates of series Xc as cells in water. Findings of strong associations of capacitance, computed from parallel Xc (X CP ), with whole body counting of 40-potassium and resting metabolic rate support the hypothesis that parallel Xc is a biomarker of body cell mass. These observations provide a theoretical and practical basis for a significant role of Xc, and hence PhA, to identify objectively graded muscle injury and to reliably monitor progress of treatment and return of muscle function.",1
Body Composition of Male Professional Soccer Players Using Different Measurement Methods: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2023-02-25,2023,MDPI AG,Nutrients,"Jaime Sebastiá-Rico, Jose M. Soriano, Noelia González-Gálvez, José Miguel Martínez-Sanz","The performance of male soccer players (MSP) depends on multiple factors such as body composition. The physical demands of modern soccer have changed, so the ideal body composition (BC) requirements must be adapted to the present. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to describe the anthropometric, BC, and somatotype characteristics of professional MSP and to compare the values reported according to the methods and equations used. We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science following the PRISMA statement. Random-effects meta-analysis, a pooled summary of means, and 95% CI (method or equation) were calculated. Random models were used with the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method. Seventy-four articles were included in the systematic review and seventy-three in the meta-analysis. After comparing the groups according to the assessment method (kinanthropometry, bioimpedance, and densitometry), significant differences were found in height, fat mass in kilograms, fat mass percentage, and fat-free mass in kilograms (p = 0.001; p < 0.0001). Taking into account the equation used to calculate the fat mass percentage and ∑skinfolds, significant differences were observed in the data reported according to groups (p < 0.001). Despite the limitations, this study provides useful information that could help medical technical staff to properly assess the BC of professional MSP, providing a range of guidance values for the different BC.",1
External load profile during different sport-specific activities in semi-professional soccer players,2023-02-22,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Guglielmo Pillitteri, Valerio Giustino, Marco Petrucci, Alessio Rossi, Marianna Bellafiore, Ewan Thomas, Angelo Iovane, Antonino Bianco, Antonio Palma, Giuseppe Battaglia","Abstract Background Global Positioning System (GPS) devices are widely used in soccer for monitoring external load (EL) indicators with the aim of maximizing sports performance.The aim of this study was to investigate the EL indicators differences in players of different playing positions (i.e., central backs, external strikers, fullbacks, midfielders, strikers, wide midfielder) between and within different sport-specific tasks and official matches. Methods 1932 observations from 28 semi-professional soccer players (age: 25 ± 6 years, height: 183 ± 6 cm, weight: 75.2 ± 7 kg) were collected through GPS devices (Qstarz BT-Q1000EX, 10 Hz) during the season 2019–2020. Participants were monitored during Official Match (OM), Friendly Matches (FM), Small Sided Games (SSG), and Match-Based Exercises (MBE). Metabolic (i.e., metabolic power, percentage of metabolic power &gt; 35w, number of intense actions per minute , distance per minute, passive recovery time per minute) and neuromuscular indicators (i.e., percentage of intense accelerations, percentage of intense decelerations, change of direction per min &gt; 30°) were recorded during each task. Results Statistically significant differences were detected in EL indicators between playing positions within each task and between tasks. In particular, results from the two-way ANOVA tests showed significant interaction, but with small effect size, in all the EL indicators between playing positions for each task and within tasks. Moreover, statistical differences, but with small effect size, between playing positions were detected in each task and for each EL indicator. Finally, the strongest statistical differences (with large effect size) were detected between tasks for each EL indicator. Details of the Tukey post-hoc analysis reporting the pairwise comparisons within and between tasks with playing positions are also provided. Conclusion In semi-professional soccer players, different metabolic and neuromuscular performance were detected in different playing position between and within different tasks and official matches. Coaches should consider the different physical responses related to different physical tasks and playing position to design the most appropriate training program.",1
"Boys demonstrate greater knee frontal moments than girls during the impact phase of cutting maneuvers, despite age-related increases in girls",2023-02-22,2023,Wiley,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","Mohammadhossein Ghasemi, Haraldur Björn Sigurðsson, Þórarinn Sveinsson, Kristín Briem","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rate is low among children, but increases during adolescence, especially in girls. Increases in the knee valgus moment within 70 ms of contact with the ground (KFM0-70) may explain the sex-specific increase in the risk of ACL injury. The purpose of the study was to investigate sex-dependent changes in the KFM0-70 from pre-adolescence to adolescence during a cutting maneuver (CM).Kinematic and kinetic data during the CM task, performed before and after physical exertion, were recorded using a motion capture system and a force plate. A total of 293 team handball and soccer players, aged 9-12 years, were recruited. A number of those who continued sports participation (n = 103) returned five years later to repeat the test procedure. Three mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures tests were used to determine the effects of sex and age period on the KFM0-70 (1: with no adjustment, 2: adjusted for repeated measurements, and 3: additionally adjusted with hip and knee joint frontal plane kinematics).Boys had significantly higher KFM0-70 than girls at both age periods (p < 0.01 for all models). Girls, not boys, demonstrated significantly increased KFM0-70 from pre-adolescence to adolescence. Importantly, this was fully explained by kinematic variables.Although the marked increase in KFM0-70 seen in girls may play a role in their risk of ACL rupture, the higher values demonstrated by boys during CM reflect the complexity of multifactorial biomechanical risk factor analysis. The role of kinematics in mediating the KFM0-70 provides means for modification of this risk factor, but as boys had higher joint moments, continued investigation into sex-dependent biomechanical risk factors is warranted.II.",1
Biomechanical characteristics of walking in representatives of women’s soccer at the age of 18 to 25 years,2023-02-21,2023,Saratov State University,Physical Education and University Sport,"Svetlana A. Banyova, Stanislav N. Kondratyev, Evgeny M. Kabaev, Olcha B. Sagdy","The peculiarities of biomechanical parameters of walking of two groups of women were studied in a comparative analysis. The first group consisted of female soccer players of 18–25 years old, having the first sports category or the category of Candidate Master of Sports; the second group included people engaged in cyclic sports (skating, cross-country skiing). At the first stage we took measurements of the test subjects, which were then entered into a computer program. At the second stage, marker sensors were attached to the head, upper and lower extremities of the subjects so that the parameters could be read by Vicon devices in different planes (XYZ). In the third stage, the markers were tracked during the dynamic tests. Comparative analysis of the results and conclusions of the work were made.",1
Heads Up! A Biomechanical Pilot Investigation of Soccer Heading Using Instrumented Mouthguards (iMGs),2023-02-18,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Darek Sokol-Randell, Oscar W. Stelzer-Hiller, David Allan, Gregory Tierney","Soccer players purposefully head the ball, raising concerns about reduced tolerance to concussion and potential long-term brain health. By combining qualitative video analysis with custom-fit instrumented mouthguards (iMGs), we aimed to categorize header kinematics (peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak angular acceleration (PAA)) by header type and ball delivery method. iMGs were fitted to 10 male collegiate players for twelve matches. A total of 133 headers were verified and contextualized via video review. The most common header type (38.7%), as well as the preceding ball delivery method (47.4%), was found to be a pass. Approximately one-quarter of header impacts (27.0%) occurred below 10 g. For header type, there were no significant differences in kinematics, with shot attempts having the highest median PLA and PAA. For ball delivery methods, goal kicks had significantly greater PAA than long balls and pass attempts. The current study highlights the utility of qualitative video analysis in combination with real-time head kinematic data from iMGs to understand the mechanism and severity of header impacts. The pilot findings indicate that high-speed ball delivery methods result in higher head kinematics and should be a focus of future mitigation strategies.",1
Using Raw Accelerometer Data to Predict High-Impact Mechanical Loading,2023-02-16,2023,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Lucas Veras, Florêncio Diniz-Sousa, Giorjines Boppre, Vítor Devezas, Hugo Santos-Sousa, John Preto, João Paulo Vilas-Boas, Leandro Machado, José Oliveira, Hélder Fonseca","The purpose of this study was to develop peak ground reaction force (pGRF) and peak loading rate (pLR) prediction equations for high-impact activities in adult subjects with a broad range of body masses, from normal weight to severe obesity. A total of 78 participants (27 males; 82.4 ± 20.6 kg) completed a series of trials involving jumps of different types and heights on force plates while wearing accelerometers at the ankle, lower back, and hip. Regression equations were developed to predict pGRF and pLR from accelerometry data. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to calculate prediction accuracy and Bland–Altman plots. Body mass was a predictor in all models, along with peak acceleration in the pGRF models and peak acceleration rate in the pLR models. The equations to predict pGRF had a coefficient of determination (R2) of at least 0.83, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) below 14.5%, while the R2 for the pLR prediction equations was at least 0.87 and the highest MAPE was 24.7%. Jumping pGRF can be accurately predicted through accelerometry data, enabling the continuous assessment of mechanical loading in clinical settings. The pLR prediction equations yielded a lower accuracy when compared to the pGRF equations.",1
Think outside the box: Incorporating secondary cognitive tasks into return to sport testing after ACL reconstruction,2023-02-15,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Courtney R. Chaaban, Jeffrey A. Turner, Darin A. Padua","The optimal set of return to sport (RTS) tests after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and ACL reconstruction (ACLR) remains elusive. Many athletes fail to pass current RTS test batteries, fail to RTS, or sustain secondary ACL injuries if they do RTS. The purpose of this review is to summarize current literature regarding functional RTS testing after ACLR and to encourage clinicians to have patients “think” (add a secondary cognitive task) outside the “box” (in reference to the box used during the drop vertical jump task) when performing functional RTS tests. We review important criteria for functional tests in RTS testing, including task-specificity and measurability. Firstly, tests should replicate the sport-specific demands the athlete will encounter when they RTS. Many ACL injuries occur when the athlete is performing a dual cognitive-motor task (e.g., attending to an opponent while performing a cutting maneuver). However, most functional RTS tests do not incorporate a secondary cognitive load. Secondly, tests should be measurable, both through the athlete’s ability to complete the task safely (through biomechanical analyses) and efficiently (through measures of performance). We highlight and critically examine three examples of functional tests that are commonly used for RTS testing: the drop vertical jump, single-leg hop tests, and cutting tasks. We discuss how biomechanics and performance can be measured during these tasks, including the relationship these variables may have with injury. We then discuss how cognitive demands can be added to these tasks, and how these demands influence both biomechanics and performance. Lastly, we provide clinicians with practical recommendations on how to implement secondary cognitive tasks into functional testing and how to assess athletes’ biomechanics and performance.",1
Definition of High-Risk Motion Patterns for Female ACL Injury Based on Football-Specific Field Data: A Wearable Sensors Plus Data Mining Approach,2023-02-15,2023,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Stefano Di Paolo, Eline M. Nijmeijer, Laura Bragonzoni, Alli Gokeler, Anne Benjaminse","The aim of the present study was to investigate if the presence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors depicted in the laboratory would reflect at-risk patterns in football-specific field data. Twenty-four female footballers (14.9 ± 0.9 year) performed unanticipated cutting maneuvers in a laboratory setting and on the football pitch during football-specific exercises (F-EX) and games (F-GAME). Knee joint moments were collected in the laboratory and grouped using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The clusters were used to investigate the kinematics collected on field through wearable sensors. Three clusters emerged: Cluster 1 presented the lowest knee moments; Cluster 2 presented high knee extension but low knee abduction and rotation moments; Cluster 3 presented the highest knee abduction, extension, and external rotation moments. In F-EX, greater knee abduction angles were found in Cluster 2 and 3 compared to Cluster 1 (p = 0.007). Cluster 2 showed the lowest knee and hip flexion angles (p &lt; 0.013). Cluster 3 showed the greatest hip external rotation angles (p = 0.006). In F-GAME, Cluster 3 presented the greatest knee external rotation and lowest knee flexion angles (p = 0.003). Clinically relevant differences towards ACL injury identified in the laboratory reflected at-risk patterns only in part when cutting on the field: in the field, low-risk players exhibited similar kinematic patterns as the high-risk players. Therefore, in-lab injury risk screening may lack ecological validity.",1
A qualitative examination of injury prevention strategy and education in Ladies Gaelic football: Understanding the preferences of players and coaches,2023-02-15,2023,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"John Corrigan, Sinéad O’Keeffe, Enda Whyte, Siobhán O’Connor","The high rates of injury in Ladies Gaelic football impact the wellbeing of players and are a major financial burden for the Ladies Gaelic Football Association. Effective injury prevention programmes have been developed for Gaelic games, but these are not currently widely adopted. The aim of this study was to qualitatively investigate adult Ladies Gaelic football players and coaches’ preferences for injury prevention strategies and injury prevention education using a constructivist grounded-theory approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 currently active Ladies Gaelic football coaches and adult players. The core strategy preferences discussed by participants were the properties of an injury prevention programme, the role of stakeholders, strategy logistics and the need for guidance and support. If the uptake and long-term adoption of an injury prevention programme is to be maximised, the preferences of the players and coaches who will ultimately utilise the programme must be understood and integrated into a wider implementation strategy developed around their needs. For education preferences, the core categories identified were the focus of education, who needs education, the format, educator, roll-out strategy, and time required. Future educational strategies must incorporate the preferences of stakeholders into their design if they are to be successful in spreading injury prevention knowledge and achieving change. To give injury prevention strategies, programmes, and education the best chances at successful adoption, it is crucial that the preferences of end-users are addressed and implemented.",1
Sex-specific differences in neuromuscular activation of the knee stabilizing muscles in adults - a systematic review,2023-02-15,2023,Aboutscience Srl,Archives of Physiotherapy,"Martina Steiner, Heiner Baur, Angela Blasimann","Abstract Introduction The rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common injuries of the knee. Women have a higher injury rate for ACL ruptures than men. Various indicators for this sex-specific difference are controversially discussed. Aim A systematic review of the literature that compares surface electromyography (EMG) values of adult female and male subjects to find out if there is a difference in neuromuscular activation of the knee stabilizing muscles. Methods This systematic review has been guided and informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies which examined sex-specific differences with surface EMG measurements (integral, root mean squares, mean values, analysis of time and amplitude) of the knee stabilizing muscles were retrieved via searches from the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, CENTRAL and SPORTDiscus. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) study quality assessment tool. A synthesis of results was performed for relevant outcomes. Results Fifteen studies with 462 healthy participants, 233 women (mean age 21.9 (± 2.29) years) and 299 men (mean age 22.6 (± 2.43) years), were included in the systematic review. The methodological quality of the studies was mostly rated “fair” (40%). A significantly higher activity of the muscles vastus lateralis and vastus medialis was found in females, in three studies. Two studies found significantly lower neuromuscular activity in the muscles biceps femoris and semitendinosus in females. All other included studies found no significant differences or reported even contradicting results. Conclusion The controversial findings do not allow for a concluding answer to the question of a sex-specific neuromuscular activation. Further research with higher statistical power and a more homogeneous methodical procedure (tasks and data normalisation) of the included studies may provide insight into possibly existing sex-specific differences in neuromuscular activation. This systematic review could help to improve the methodical design of future studies to get a more valid conclusion of the issue. Trial registration CRD42020189504.",1
Conditioning Strategy for Previous Injured Players,2023-02-15,2023,IntechOpen,Innovations in Football Science [Working Title],Tomonori Kawai,"Football players are prone to sports injuries such as ankle sprain, groin pain, ACL injury, and so on. Muscle strain injury also frequently occurs in football games or practice. As previous studies show, previously injured players have altered muscle and neural functions as well as tissue properties associated with muscle strain injury. They have altered vibration sense, tissue stiffness, and increases in micro-muscle damage. However, training load or conditioning programs are provided the same as those for uninjured players in most cases. In this chapter, the conditioning strategies for players who have previous muscle injuries will be suggested according to the phenomenon after muscle strain injury.",1
Menstrual Cycle and Sport Injuries: A Systematic Review,2023-02-13,2023,MDPI AG,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Núria Martínez-Fortuny, Alejandra Alonso-Calvete, Iria Da Cuña-Carrera, Rocío Abalo-Núñez","The presence of female athletes has only increased in recent years, as has the incidence of injuries in female sports activities. These injuries are conditioned by multiple factors, including hormonal agents. It is estimated that the menstrual cycle may be related to the predisposition to suffer an injury. However, a causal relationship has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between the menstrual cycle and injuries in female sports practice. A systematic search of the scientific literature available in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Sport Discus was carried out in January 2022. With 138 articles, only eight studies were found that met the selection criteria for this study. Peak estradiol is associated with increased laxity, strength, and poor use of neuromuscular control. Thus, the ovulatory phase is associated with an increased risk of injury. In conclusion, it seems that hormonal fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle alter values such as laxity, strength, body temperature, and neuromuscular control, among others. This fact causes women to constantly adapt to hormonal variations, which exposes them to a higher risk of injury.",1
Validity and reliability of the physiological and perceptual responses elicited during a novel treadmill-based Soccer Referee Simulation (SRS),2023-02-12,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sport Sciences for Health,"Gary P. McEwan, Viswanath B. Unnithan, Chris Easton, Andrew J. Glover, Rosie Arthur","Abstract Purpose This study explored the validity and reliability of the physiological and perceptual responses elicited during a novel treadmill-based Soccer Referee Simulation (SRS). Methods Following the collection of baseline measures and habituation procedures, eight sub-elite soccer referees completed a single trial of the SRS whereby measures of heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 ), blood lactate concentrations ([La − ] b ), and differential ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained. Referees’ HR responses were also monitored during a series of competitive matches (5 match observations per referee). For the reliability aspect of the investigation, eight well-trained males with soccer playing experience and a comparable physiological profile were initially habituated, and thereafter completed three separate trials of the SRS during which the reliability of the selected outcome variables were ascertained. Trials were separated by 3–7 days and performed under standardised conditions. Results No differences were evidenced between the SRS and match play in relation to measures of mean HR ( P = 0.444; ES = 0.29), peak HR ( P = 0.074; ES = 0.74), or HR-based training impulse ( P = 0.498; ES = 0.25). Additionally, no systematic differences were detected between reliability trials for any of the measured outcome variables ( P ≥ 0.293), whilst good levels of reliability were observed for measures of mean HR (ICC = 0.94; CV = 3.1%), peak HR (ICC = 0.93; CV = 2.2%), HR-based training impulse (ICC = 0.95; CV = 10.0%), mean V̇O 2 (ICC = 0.95; CV = 2.6%); [La − ] b (ICC ≥ 0.89; CV ≤ 11.5%), and differential RPE (ICC ≥ 0.94; CV ≤ 15.1%). Conclusion The SRS represents a valid and reliable protocol that closely replicates the physiological and decision-making demands of soccer refereeing.",1

Measuring direct and indirect tendon parameters to characterize the proximal tendinous complex of the rectus femoris in football and futsal players,2023-02-07,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Sandra Mechó, Raquel Lisbona Ortega, Ricard Pruna, Lexa Nescolarde Selva, Jordi Morillas Pérez, Alfonso Rodríguez-Baeza, Javier Martínez Agea, Ricard Pérez-Andrés","Objective: To present unprecedented radiological parameters that characterize the angle between the direct and indirect tendons of the proximal rectus femoris (RF) and its inclinations and to evaluate the population variability according to demographic variables. Materials and methods: From September 2019 to July 2021, using MRI multiplanar reconstructions of the proximal thigh/hip, two blinded radiologists measured the direct and indirect tendon angle and the inclination of each tendon in different planes. The intra- and inter-observer agreements were assessed with Bland–Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The correlations between radiological parameters and demographic variables were evaluated using linear regression, Student’s t- test, and analysis of variance. Results: We performed 112 thigh/hip MRI scans on 91 football players of different age, gender, and disciplines (football and futsal). For observer 1 (the reference), the mean direct and indirect tendon angle was 56.74° ± 9.37, the mean indirect tendon slope was −7.90° ± 7.49, and the mean direct tendon slope was 22.16° ± 5.88. The three measurements showed inter- and intra-observer agreement (mean differences ∼0). No correlation was observed between age and the parameters. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were found for gender, dominant limb, examined limb, and sport. Conclusion: There is an inter- and intra-observer agreement in the measurements of the direct and indirect tendon angle and the inclination of each tendon. There is population variability in the proximal tendinous complex unrelated to demographic factors. These results allow further detection of morphological patterns that represent a risk factor for lesions in the RF in professional football and futsal players and other sports.",1

A Multidimensional Assessment of a Novel Adaptive Versus Traditional Passive Ankle Sprain Protection Systems,2023-02-03,2023,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Steffen Willwacher, Anna Bruder, Johanna Robbin, Jakob Kruppa, Patrick Mai","Background: Ankle braces aim to reduce lateral ankle sprains. Next to protection, factors influencing user compliance, such as sports performance, motion restriction, and users’ perceptions, are relevant for user compliance and thus injury prevention. Novel adaptive protection systems claim to change their mechanical behavior based on the intensity of motion (eg, the inversion velocity), unlike traditional passive concepts of ankle bracing. Purpose: To compare the performance of a novel adaptive brace with 2 passive ankle braces while considering protection, sports performance, freedom of motion, and subjective perception. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The authors analyzed 1 adaptive and 2 passive (one lace-up and one rigid brace) ankle braces, worn in a low-cut, indoor sports shoe, which was also the no-brace reference condition. We performed material testing using an artificial ankle joint system at high and low inversion velocities. Further, 20 male, young, healthy team sports athletes were analyzed using 3-dimensional motion analysis in sports-related movements to address protection, sports performance, and active range of motion dimensions. Participants rated subjective comfort, stability, and restriction experienced when using the products. Results: Subjective stability rating was not different between the adaptive and passive systems. The rigid brace was superior in restricting peak inversion during the biomechanical testing compared with the passive braces. However, in the material test, the adaptive brace increased its stiffness by approximately 400% during the fast compared with the slow inversion velocities, demonstrating its adaptive behavior and similar stiffness values to passive braces. We identified minor differences in sports performance tasks. The adaptive brace improved active ankle range of motion and subjective comfort and restriction ratings. Conclusion: The adaptive brace offered similar protective effects in high-velocity inversion situations to those of the passive braces while improving range of motion, comfort, and restriction rating during noninjurious motions. Clinical Relevance: Protection systems are only effective when used. Compared with traditional passive ankle brace technologies, the novel adaptive brace might increase user compliance by improving comfort and freedom of movement while offering similar protection in injurious situations.",1
A need for speed: Objectively identifying full-body kinematic and neuromuscular features associated with faster sprint velocities,2023-02-03,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Chris L. Vellucci, Shawn M. Beaudette","Sprinting is multifactorial and dependent on a variety of kinematic, kinetic, and neuromuscular features. A key objective in sprinting is covering a set amount of distance in the shortest amount of time. To achieve this, sprinters are required to coordinate their entire body to achieve a fast sprint velocity. This suggests that a whole-body kinematic and neuromuscular coordinative strategy exists which is associated with improved sprint performance. The purpose of this study was to leverage inertial measurement units (IMUs) and wireless surface electromyography (sEMG) to find coordinative strategies associated with peak over-ground sprint velocity using machine learning. We recruited 40 healthy university age sprint-based athletes from a variety of athletic backgrounds. IMU and sEMG data were used as inputs into a principal components analysis (PCA) to observe major modes of variation (i.e., PC scores). PC scores were then used as inputs into a stepwise multivariate linear regression model to derive associations of each mode of variation with peak sprint velocity. Both the kinematic (R2 = 0.795) and sEMG data (R2 = 0.586) produced significant multivariate linear regression models. The PCs that were selected as inputs into the multivariate linear regression model were reconstructed using multi-component reconstruction to produce a representation of the whole-body movement pattern and changes in the sEMG waveform associated with faster sprint velocities. The findings of this work suggest that distinct features are associated with faster sprint velocity. These include the timing of the contralateral arm and leg swing, stance leg kinematics, dynamic trunk extension at toe-off, asymmetry between the right and left swing side leg and a phase shift feature of the posterior chain musculature. These results demonstrate the utility of data-driven frameworks in identifying different coordinative features that are associated with a movement outcome. Using our framework, coaches and biomechanists can make decisions based on objective movement information, which can ultimately improve an athlete's performance.",1
Differences in Thigh Muscle Activation Between Standing and Landing Exercises for Knee Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation,2023-02-01,2023,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,"Jesper Bencke, Mark Strøm, Derek J. Curtis, Thomas Bandholm, Mette K. Zebis","In injury prevention or rehabilitation programs, exercises that facilitate enhanced hamstring activity may be beneficial when aiming to enhance knee joint stability during movements in sports with higher risk of acute knee injury. Information about neuromuscular activation of the hamstring muscles in commonly used exercises may improve exercise selection and progression in programs for knee injury prevention or rehabilitation. To investigate (1) how balance devices with progressing degrees of instability influence the activity of muscles controlling the knee joint in typical balance exercises with different demands on postural control, and (2) if any between-sex differences exist. Cross-sectional study. Twenty habitually active healthy adults (11 males) participated in this cross-sectional study. Single-leg stance, single-leg squat and single-leg landing were performed on the floor and two different balance devices imposing various levels of challenge to postural control. Three-dimensional motion analysis was used to obtain hip and knee joint angles, and as primary outcomes, and peak normalized EMG activity from the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles was measured for comparison between exercises. The more challenging in terms of maintaining stable balance the devices were, the higher hamstring muscle activity levels were observed. There was a clear progression across balance devices from single-leg stance to single-leg squat and further to single-leg landing displaying increasing hamstring activity levels. The change in medial hamstring activity across all devices when changing from single-leg squat to single-leg landing was significantly higher for the female participants than for the males reaching a higher level of activity. The muscle activity of the hamstrings and quadriceps increased when the motor task was more dynamic. Specifically, single-leg landings were effective in increasing the hamstring muscle activity over the single-leg stance to single-leg squat exercises, and muscle activity was significantly increased with the most unstable device. Increases in hamstring muscle activation was greater in female subjects than males with increasing instability of the balance devices. Not registered. 3.",1
Risk factors of lower extremity injuries in youth athletes,2023-02-01,2023,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Tomoaki Kamiya, Atsushi Teramoto, Hidenori Otsubo, Takashi Matsumura, Yasutoshi Ikeda, Kota Watanabe, Toshihiko Yamashita","Lower extremity sports injuries frequently occur during an individual's growth period. The object of the current study was to analyse the risk factors for lower extremity sports injuries for youth athletes. The secondary objective was to clarify the factors related to new injuries after a lower extremity injury.We extracted information on youth athletes (aged 10-15 years) with sports-related disorders. Background data and injury situations were collected via a specific application. During the follow-up period, new injuries were also recorded. The athletes were divided into two groups according to injury location (lower extremity or other). We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to clarify the association between injury location and background data.1575 complaints of lower extremity disorders and 328 complaints in other body parts were registered. According to the multiple regression analysis, practice time per week was significantly shorter for the lower extremity group than the other locations group (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.963 to 0.999). Athletes whose future goal was at the recreational level had a significantly low incidence of new injuries after experiencing lower extremity disorders.The practice environments and psychological factors should receive more attention to prevent lower extremity injuries.",1
Adding A Structured Educational Session to the Rehabilitation Program of Soccer Players Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Feasibility Study,2023-02-01,2023,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,"ABDULLAH ALMUHAYA, ALI ALBARRATI, AHMED ALHOWIMEL, FARIS ALODAIBI","While a lack of psychological preparedness and fear of movement may be linked with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) re-injury, these variables are rarely addressed throughout the therapy stages via educational sessions. Unfortunately, in terms of reducing fear, increasing function, and returning to play, no research has been done yet on the efficacy of adding organized educational sessions to the rehabilitation programs of soccer players post-ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Therefore, the study's aim was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of adding organized educational sessions to the rehabilitation programs post-ACLR.",1
Analogical and Diversification of Anthropometric and Motor Performance Characteristics among Female Universities Soccer Players in Ghana,2023-02-01,2023,"Horizon Research Publishing Co., Ltd.",International Journal of Human Movement and Sports Sciences,"Mensah Kwabena Timothy, Moses Monday Omoniyi, Deku Prince De-Gualle","There are uneven academic sports policies and sociocultural diversities in Ghana.While academic sports policies and sociocultural diversities often call for acclimatization of athletes, scarce research on the analogical and diversification anthropometric and motor performance characteristics restricts decision-making policy on female soccer participation.This study presents the analogical and diversifications of the anthropometric and motor performance characteristics among the university female soccer athletes.The cross-sectional study had 44 female athletes from topmost universities with mean age of 21.54±1.79years and playing experience of 6.75±1.51years.Leg length, thigh girth, calf girth, upper arm length, forearm length, upper arm girth, chest girth, finger span, speed, leg power, abdominal strength, agility, flexibility, upper body strength, distant kick, dribbling, and accuracy were measured, compared among institutions, and with international normative values (INV).There was no significant difference in all characteristics except abdominal strength (P = .000),distant kick (P = .009),thigh girth (P = .003),and calf girth (P = .002).When compared to INV, there was significant difference in all characteristics except the upper arm length (p= .587),forearm length (p= .734),and agility (p= .479).This study suggests that female soccer players in all the topmost universities in Ghana are equally good sports potentials for national recruitment.",1
THE INFLUENCE OF FOOTBALL CLASSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPATIAL-TEMPORAL ACCURACY OF MOVEMENTS STUDENTS HIGHER EDUCATION,2023-01-30,2023,National Pedagogical Dragomanov University,Scientific Journal of National Pedagogical Dragomanov University. Series 15. Scientific and pedagogical problems of physical culture (physical culture and sports),"L. Anikеіenko, V. Bilokon","In the article, the impact of football on the development of space-time accuracy of movements in students of higher education institutions. It is established that physical education in higher education institutions is an integral part of the education and upbringing of modern youth. When solving a problem that is associated with health promotion, development of motor qualities, formation of students' motor skills, the physical education system should be improved in line with the modern concept of general education. The current trends of organization of physical education in educational institutions, features of development of motor qualities of students and the possibility of using technical equipment during football classes are analyzed.&#x0D; Football classes can be conducted in various forms of organization of exercise in higher education institutions, do not require special conditions of organization and are implemented both in the gym and on the open playground, with a contingent of different ages, gender, level of technical and physical fitness. The quality of the educational process in football depends on its proper planning (formation of content, means and methods of training of technique and development of physical qualities, selection of parameters of physical activity and their rational regulation), as well as on the objective assessment of motor skills and skills of student youth. The need to improve the efficiency of exercise in educational institutions requires the search for new or improving traditional approaches to students' motor training. The introduction of technical equipment in the educational process of physical culture increases the developmental effect of physical exercises due to the possibility of purposeful influence on motor qualities in unity with training of technique, accurate dosage of parameters of physical activity and increased motor density of classes.",1
Predictive modeling of lower extremity injury risk in male elite youth soccer players using <scp>LASSO</scp> Regression,2023-01-27,2023,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Mathias Kolodziej, Andreas Groll, Kevin Nolte, Steffen Willwacher, Tobias Alt, Marcus Schmidt, Thomas Jaitner","To (1) identify neuromuscular and biomechanical injury risk factors in elite youth soccer players and (2) assess the predictive ability of a machine learning approach.Fifty-six elite male youth soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.1 years; height: 179 ± 8 cm; mass: 70.4 ± 9.2 kg) performed a 3D motion analysis, postural control testing, and strength testing. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to identify the most important injury predictors. Predictive performance of the LASSO model was determined in a leave-one-out (LOO) prediction competition.Twenty-three non-contact injuries were registered. The LASSO model identified concentric knee extensor peak torque, hip transversal plane moment in the single-leg drop landing task and center of pressure sway in the single-leg stance test as the three most important predictors for injury in that order. The LASSO model was able to predict injury outcomes with a likelihood of 58% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.63 (sensitivity = 35%; specificity = 79%).The three most important variables for predicting the injury outcome suggest the importance of neuromuscular and biomechanical performance measures in elite youth soccer. These preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and planning, as well as for the development of customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors. However, the poor predictive performance of the final model confirms the challenge of predicting sports injuries, and the model must therefore be evaluated in larger samples.",1
The Mechanism of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in the National Football League: A Systematic Video Review,2023-01-27,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Samuel Schick, Colin K Cantrell, Bradley Young, Zachary Mosher, Michael Ewing, Joseph W Elphingstone, Eugene Brabston, Brent A Ponce, Amit M Momaya","Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common among American football athletes, although few studies have performed video analyses of ACL injuries to better understand the injury mechanism. This work aims to characterize the mechanism of ACL injury during professional football competitions using video analysis. We hypothesize that football-specific injury trends will emerge, including high rates of contact injuries and associations with shallow knee and hip flexion angles (0°-30°). Methods Videos of professional football players suffering ACL injuries from 2007 to 2016 were analyzed. Injured players were identified using the injured reserve (IR) lists of the National Football League (NFL), and videos were discovered via a systematic Google search. Descriptive statistics and frequency analyses were performed on all variables using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA). Results Of the 429 ACL injuries identified, 53 (12%) videos were available. Deceleration was the most common injury maneuver, present in 32 (60%) athletes. Thirty-one (58%) players suffered contact injuries. Twenty-eight (53%) injuries demonstrated valgus collapse of the knee, and 26 (49%) had neutral knee rotation. Defensive backs (26%) and wide receivers (23%) were the most frequently injured positions. Conclusion Overall, we found that most ACL injuries had preceding contact, deceleration, shallow hip and knee flexion, and heel strike, and subsequent valgus collapse and neutral knee rotation. This understanding of American football-specific ACL tear mechanisms could help direct the focus of future injury prevention training modalities.",1
50 The association between the Sprint Mechanics Assessment Score (S-MAS) to retrospective and prospective Hamstring Strain Injuries in elite football players,2023-01-25,2023,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Abstracts,"Chris Bramah, Thomas Dos’Santos","<h3>Introduction</h3> Sprint running mechanics are thought to be a risk factor for Hamstring Strain Injuries (HSI). However, there is limited evidence to support this association, which may be explained by the lack of in-field assessment methods to evaluate sprint running mechanics. This study aimed to investigate whether a new qualitative screening tool, the Sprint Mechanics Assessment Score (S-MAS), can identify differences in running mechanics between players who have sustained a HSI in the last 12 months (Prior HSI), those prospectively sustaining a new HSI, and controls. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> Maximal velocity sprint running videos (240fps) were collected from 79 elite football players (18 female, 61 male) in the English Football League. A blinded assessor scored all videos using the S-MAS (12-point qualitative screening tool for sprint mechanics). Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare S-MAS between injured groups (Prior HSI, n=12 and New HSI, n=3) to sex-matched controls (n=41). <h3>Results</h3> Mean S-MAS for the Prior HSI group (6.2, SD 1.9) were significantly greater than controls (4.4, SD 2.4) (p &lt;.05, Effect size (ES) = 0.76). Players sustaining a new HSI also displayed greater S-MAS scores compared to controls (mean 6.3, SD 0.6, ES = 0.8), however this was non-significant (p = .187). <h3>Conclusion</h3> S-MAS scores are higher in footballers with HSI's compared to controls, suggesting sub-optimal sprint mechanics are associated with previous and possibly future HSI. The easy-to-use nature of the S-MAS means screening sprint running mechanics can be simply integrated into routine practice, potentially identifying footballers at HSI risk.",1
111 Using biomechanics to assess the countermovement jump as a tool to measure male and female adolescents with ACL injury,2023-01-25,2023,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Abstracts,"Joana Hornestam, Blake Miller, Sasha Carsen, Daniel Benoit","<h3>Introduction</h3> Adolescent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have increased substantially over the last two decades and some 25% will experience a re-injury following surgery, with injury rates highest among females. As such, improved return to activity metrics are imperative. Vertical jump performance is a one commonly used tool, however performance standards and the role of the injured or non-injured limb in achieving jump height is unknown for adolescent males and females. As such, the purpose of this study was to (1) assess performance in ACL injured and uninjured adolescents, and (2) assess limb contributions to this performance. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> Thirty-one ACL injured and thirty-eight control female adolescents, and fifteen ACL injured and twenty-five control male adolescents performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) task while whole body 3D kinematics were recorded. Maximum jump height and the maximum sagittal hip, knee, and ankle velocities were calculated. Females and males were analysed separately, while contrasts were made between limbs and injury status. <h3>Results</h3> Jump height was 13% lower in the ACLi compared to CON, while the ACLi contralateral limb also produced greater hip, knee and ankle angular velocities compared to their injured limb in females. No difference was found in jump height between ACLi and CON, however the contralateral limb of the ACLi males had greater hip and knee extension angular velocities. Neither male nor female controls had inter-limb differences. <h3>Conclusion</h3> ACLi adolescents shielded the injured limb to achieve similar jump performance. This leads to asymmetrical joint loading and may explain injury risk.",1

The team physical therapist (PT) classified the athlete-reported injuries using a standardized examination form. Injuries with more than 3 days' time-loss or reported in 2 consecutive weeks were eligible for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), applied to describe the injury characteristics. <h3>Results</h3> The PTs examined 66 of 126 athlete-reported groin injuries (52%). Thirty-nine (59%) of the PT-examined injuries were classified as adductor-related, 10 (15%) iliopsoas-related, 6 (9%) in rectus femoris, 4 (6%) pubic-related, 4 (6%) hip-related, 2 (3%) inguinal-related, and one (2%) other. Rectus femoris injuries caused the greatest time-loss (median: 15 days, IQR: 6–26), followed by pubic-related injuries (median: 14 days, IQR: 1–91). Of the 55 injuries meeting MRI criteria, 42 (76%) were investigated with MRI. Of the injuries examined by MRI we found no findings in 8 cases (19%), acute injury findings in 6 cases (14%) and chronic findings in 29 cases (69%). The most common acute and chronic findings were in the proximal rectus femoris (n=4) and symphyseal joint surface irregularities or subchondral cysts (n=7), respectively. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Adductor-related groin injuries were the most common, and injuries to the rectus femoris caused the greatest time-loss. The majority of MRI examinations demonstrated chronic findings.",1
"18 Is my ACLR strong enough? Graft type, activity level influence knee strength in 392 athletes across five time points",2023-01-25,2023,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Abstracts,"Vasileios Korakakis, Roula Kotsifaki, Rod Whiteley","<h3>Introduction</h3> An essential priority in rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is the restoration of knee muscle strength. We aimed to describe quadriceps and hamstrings strength after ACLR of an uncomplicated rehabilitation course, categorized into level of activity and graft type (patellar-tendon – BPTBG, hamstring – HSG). <h3>Methods</h3> Isokinetic concentric strength (body weight – BW-adjusted) was measured in 392 athletes (26.2±6.7y) at five time-points (3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, and 9m) following ACLR. Data was analyzed using mixed-effects models and participant specific random effects. Fixed effects included graft type, athlete categorization, and assessment time. We applied Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. <h3>Results</h3> Professional athletes (HSG) displayed greater quadriceps strength than recreational (BPTBG) at all time-points (except 7.5m). No other significant differences were noted. Professional and recreational athletes' quadriceps strength significantly increased through time (irrespective of graft type). Professionals (HSG) reached &gt;2.5 BW quadriceps strength at 6-months, and recreationals &gt;2.3 BW at 7.5-months. Professional athletes showed significantly greater hamstring strength through time (irrespective of graft type). Both athletic categories reached maximum hamstring strength at 6-months post operatively (&gt;1.7 BPTB and &gt;1.5 HS, BW). Recreational athletes (BPTBG) displayed a significant increase in hamstring strength (1.4 BW, 4.5m), while for recreational athletes (HSG) strength was consistently improving up to 7.5m. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Knee strength increases during rehabilitation but at the initial phase of ACLR rehabilitation is influenced by the graft type, while at the end of rehabilitation it is affected by the activity level. The maximum achieved strength is affected mostly by activity level.",1
48 Hamstring muscle activation during single leg jump after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a semitendinosus graft,2023-01-25,2023,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Abstracts,"Kristin Briem, Páll Steinar Sigurbjörnsson, Hilmir Kristjánsson, Árni Árnason","<h3>Introduction</h3> Few studies have used electromyography (EMG) to assess hamstrings function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to identify inter-limb differences in muscle activity of the semitendinosus (ST) and the long head of the biceps femoris (BFLH) after ACLR while accounting for the muscles' mass, as measured with ultrasound. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> Twenty athletes (age 18–28) who had undergone ACLR with a graft harvested from ST partook in the study. Electrodes were placed over the midbelly of ST and BFLH bilaterally. Peak muscle activity was measured during three good trials of a single leg jump and normalized to the signal obtained during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Ultrasound was used to measure muscle mass. Processing was conducted in Visual 3D, while mixed model statistical analysis was performed with Jamovi. <h3>Results</h3> Peak activation of BFLH was higher than ST across both sides (p&lt;0.001) and activation of both muscles was generally higher on the injured vs. uninjured side (p&lt;0.001). Muscle mass of ST on the injured side was negatively correlated with muscle activity, while the correlation was positive on the uninjured side (interaction; p&lt;0.001). No correlation was found between muscle mass and BFLH muscle activation (n.s.). <h3>Conclusion</h3> The use of ST for ACLR not only has a significant effect on the muscle's mass but also influences muscle contraction levels of the injured limb. Prospective intervention studies are needed to determine whether specific post-surgical intervention may positively influence long-term muscle mass and activation, and lower limb function.",1
49 The Sprint Mechanics Assessment Score (S-MAS): a reliable tool assessing in-field sprint running mechanics associated with hamstring strain injuries,2023-01-25,2023,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Abstracts,"Chris Bramah, Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo, Joshua Elliott, Thomas Dos’Santos","<h3>Introduction</h3> Qualitative movement screening tools have been developed across several activities, aiming to identify mechanical patterns associated with potential injury risk. Although sprint running mechanics are thought to influence hamstring strain injuries (HSI), there are currently no field-based screening tools available allowing quick assessment. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the intra- and inter-tester reliability of a novel, easy-to-use qualitative screening tool assessing sprint running mechanics (The Sprint Mechanics Assessment Score [S-MAS]). <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> The S-MAS is a 12-item scoring tool, developed following a literature review of biomechanical parameters associated with HSI and consultation with sprint coaches. Slow-motion videos were collected from 36 elite football players (18 female, 18 male) performing maximal velocity sprints. Two assessors, blinded to each other's results, independently scored all videos. One assessor (blinded to testing session one scores) scored the same videos in a randomised order 1 week later. <h3>Results</h3> Interclass correlation coefficients showed good intra-tester (ICC = .828, 95%CI = .688-.908) and inter-tester (ICC = .799, 95%CI = .642-.892) reliability for overall S-MAS with a standard error of 1 point. Intra-tester and inter-tester percentage agreements for individual items ranged from 75–88% and 66–89% respectively. No significant sex (p = .597) or inter-limb (p = .094) differences were observed for overall score. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The S-MAS is a reliable tool assessing sprint running mechanics in both male and female footballers. The easy-to-use nature of the S-MAS means it can be integrated into practice, providing an in-field method of screening sprint mechanics commonly associated with HSI.",1

The aim of this study was to describe the injury and illness patterns in women's premier league football. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> During the 2020 and 2021 seasons players in the women's premier football league in Norway reported all health problems (acute injuries, overuse injuries and illnesses) weekly, using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre Questionnaire on Health Problems. We calculated incidence, average weekly prevalence, and burden (the cross-product of incidence and severity) of all health problems reported. <h3>Results</h3> We included 294 female football players (22±4 years, range: 16–37) in the study. The average response rate to the weekly questionnaire was 79% (SD: ±9%). On average, 32% (95% CI, 31% to 33%) of the players reported at least one health problem at any time and 22% (95% CI, 21% to 23%) reported a health problem negatively affecting their training volume or performance. Acute injuries caused the greatest burden of all health problems (68% of the total burden), followed by overuse injuries (25%) and illness (8%). Thigh was the most common injury location (n=143, 26% of all cases), but knee injuries caused the greatest time-loss (42% of total time-loss). <h3>Conclusion</h3> One in five players in the women's premier league in Norway had a health problem negatively affecting their training volume or performance at any time. Acute injuries represented the most burdensome health problem. Thigh injuries were most frequent while knee injuries caused the greatest time-loss.",1
19 Sex-dependent differences on knee frontal moment in pre-adolescent and adolescent ages during a cutting maneuver task,2023-01-25,2023,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Abstracts,"Mohammadhossein Ghasemi, Haraldur Björn Sigurðsson, Þórarinn Sveinsson, Kristín Briem","<h3>Introduction</h3> Although the rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is low among children, it increases during adolescence, especially in girls. The injury typically occurs immediately after foot-ground contact during sports activities such as a cutting maneuver (CM). The knee frontal plane moment (KFM) has been implicated as a biomechanical risk factor, but it has not been extensively studied within the injury timeframe. The present study aimed to prospectively investigate sex-dependent changes in the KFM from pre-adolescence to adolescence during the first 70 ms of a CM task. <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 293 handball and soccer players, aged 9–12 years, were recruited to perform a CM, where kinematic and kinetic data were obtained using marker-based motion capture and force plates. Those who continued sports participation (n=105) returned five years later to repeat the test procedure. A mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used for statistical analysis of the KFM during the first 70 ms after foot-ground contact. <h3>Results</h3> Overall, boys had significantly higher valgus KFM values than girls across both data collections (P=0.001). Also, a significant interaction between sex and age was observed, where girls and boys demonstrated respectively an increase and decrease in the valgus KFM values from pre-adolescence to adolescence age (13.8% increase vs. 10.6% decrease: P=0.001). <h3>Conclusion</h3> The remarkable increase of KFM in adolescent athlete girls may, in part, play a role in their risk of ACL injury, although future studies need to assess the relationship between this increase and rate of ACL injuries.",1
Return to sports after arthroscopic Bankart repair in teenage athletes: a retrospective cohort study,2023-01-24,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Yohei Harada, Yusuke Iwahori, Yukihiro Kajita, Ryosuke Takahashi, Shin Yokoya, Yasuhiko Sumimoto, Masataka Deie, Nobuo Adachi","Abstract Background Anterior shoulder instability is frequent among young athletes. Surgical treatment for this injury aims to facilitate an early return to sports (RTS). However, the rate of recurrent instability after surgery is reportedly high among young patients, and it is unclear whether surgery ensures satisfactory RTS. The purpose of this study was to verify the clinical outcomes and RTS after arthroscopic Bankart repair in competitive teenage athletes without critical bone loss in the glenoid. Methods We retrospectively reviewed competitive teenage athletes who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair. Patients with large bony defects in the glenoid, larger than 20% of the healthy side, were excluded. Clinical outcomes, recurrent instability, the final level of RTS, and the time needed for RTS were analyzed. Results In total, 50 patients with a mean follow-up period of 44.5 ± 19.6 (range, 24–85 months) months were included. The mean age at surgery was 16.8 ± 1.7 (range, 13–19 years) years. Two patients (4.0%) experienced recurrent instability. All patients returned to sports, 96% of patients participated competitively, and 76% achieved a complete return to the pre-injury level without any complaints. The time for RTS was 6.6 ± 2.7 months (range, 3–18 months), to competitions was 9.3 ± 4.0 (range, 6–24 months) months, and to complete return was 10.6 ± 4.3 (range, 8–24 months) months. The complete return rates varied by sports type, with 82% in contact athletes, 59% in dominant-hand overhead athletes, and 100% in other athletes ( P = 0.026). Other preoperative factors or concomitant lesion such as bony Bankart, superior labrum tear, or humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligament lesion did not affect the complete RTS. Conclusion Arthroscopic Bankart repair is an effective surgical procedure for anterior shoulder instability, even among competitive teenage athletes. Sports type was the only factor associated with complete RTS after surgery.",1
Comparison of agility between the flat foot and normal foot in East Java Puslatda athletes,2023-01-24,2023,"DiscoverSys, Inc.",Bali Medical Journal,"Bobby Kennedy, Damayanti Tinduh, Ditaruni Asrina Utami, I Putu Alit Pawana, Soenarnatalina Melaniani","Background: Flat foot, also known as pes planus, is a postural deformity characterized by the fall of the foot's arch, with all or almost all of the soles of the foot in contact with a flat surface. A flat foot is related to the function of the lower leg, increases the likelihood of sports injuries, and affects the motor abilities of the lower limbs. This study aims to compare the agility of the athletes of the East Java Puslatda with flat feet and normal feet. Method: This study is an observational retrospective study using the medical records of athletes who underwent sports injury risk screening at the Sports Clinic RSUD dr. Soetomo Surabaya. Subjects were divided into the flat foot and normal foot groups. The agility of both groups was measured using Agility T-drill test tools and compared between the two groups. Results: There were 46 subjects divided into 23 subjects in the flat foot group (14 males and 9 females aged 17-33 years) and 23 subjects in the normal foot group (12 males and 11 females aged 16-31 years). The average agility in the flat foot group was 11.23 ± 0.19 seconds (9.62 seconds - 12.74 seconds), while in the normal foot group, it was 11.12 ± 0.21 seconds (9.16 seconds - 13.38 seconds). There was no significant difference in agility between the two study groups. Analysis of each sport showed no significant difference in agility between the flat foot and normal foot groups. Analysis according to intrinsic factors showed a significant positive correlation with moderate strength between agility and gender. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in agility between athletes with flat foot and normal foot.",1
Acute Pelvic and Hip Apophyseal Avulsion Fractures in Adolescents: A Summary of 719 Cases,2023-01-23,2023,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics,"Samantha L. Ferraro, Miles Batty, Benton E. Heyworth, Danielle L. Cook, Patricia E. Miller, Eduardo N. Novais","Apophyseal avulsion fractures of the pelvis and hip are common injuries in adolescent athletes. However, high volume comparative studies elucidating the spectrum of injuries are largely absent from the literature. The current study provides a comprehensive analysis of demographic, anatomic, pathophysiological, clinical, and athletic-related variables associated with such injuries in an extensive population of affected adolescents.A retrospective review was performed of records of patients presenting to a single tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 1, 2005, and July 31, 2020, collecting variables including patient sex, age, body mass index, fracture location, injury mechanism, sport at the time of injury, and duration of prodromal symptoms.Seven hundred nineteen fractures were identified in 709 patients. The average patient age was 14.6, and 78% of the fractures occurred in male patients. The anterior inferior iliac spine (33.4%), anterior superior iliac spine (30.5%), and ischial tuberosity (19.4%) were the most common fracture sites. The most common injury mechanisms were running (27.8%), kicking (26.7%), and falls (8.8%). The most common sports at the time of injury were soccer (38.1%), football (11.2%), and baseball (10.5%). Fracture site was significantly associated with patient sex, age, body mass index, laterality, mechanism, sport, time from injury, and presence of prodromal symptoms. The annual volume of pelvic avulsion fractures treated at the institution increased significantly from n=17 in 2005 to n=75 in 2019.Adolescent pelvic and hip avulsion fractures occur during a narrow window of age and skeletal maturation and are frequently sustained during sporting activities. Each fracture location is associated with certain demographic, mechanistic, and patient-specific characteristics. The associations between fracture site and patient-specific or injury-specific variables offer insights into the pathophysiology and possible underlying biomechanical risk factors that contribute to these injuries.This is a level III retrospective study.",1
Gym-Based Training Interventions for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Reduction in American Football Players,2023-01-23,2023,SAGE Publications,HSS Journal®: The Musculoskeletal Journal of Hospital for Special Surgery,Cameron M.

One primary aim of training to reduce injury risk is to provide exercises for players on attaining the highest athletic performance with the least orthopedic stress. This review article on ACL injury reduction protocols focuses on the protective and performance-enhancing biomechanical patterns during simple exercises used in a gym-based setting, in the following areas: single-leg balance and trunk stability, single-leg jumping/plyometrics, and reflexive strength training. This supplementary training, as part of a sports performance program, might include training to develop maximum strength, explosive power, acceleration, maximum velocity, bioenergetic endurance qualities, mobility/flexibility, agility, and sport skill acquisition.",1
Composite Score of Readiness (CSR) as a Data Reduction Technique for Monitoring the RTS Process in Footballers following ACL Reconstruction,2023-01-21,2023,MDPI AG,Symmetry,"Łukasz Oleksy, Anna Mika, Renata Kielnar, Miłosz Szczudło, Henryk Racheniuk, Olga Adamska, Marian Rzepko, Aleksandra Królikowska, Paweł Reichert, Robert Prill, Artur Stolarczyk","In recent years, many studies on the safe return to sport (RTS) have been published, but there are still no clear and validated guidelines. After ACL reconstruction between limbs, asymmetry of muscle strength affects knee mechanics during walking and running, and asymmetrical joint kinematics and kinetics are considered as a strong risk factor of musculoskeletal injury. Therefore, proper diagnosis of any motor deficits remaining after ACL reconstruction seems particularly important. The aim of this study was to analyze how many tests should be included in the RTS test battery and which of them are most indicative for functional deficits related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Sixty-five male football players (age 18–25 years) were divided into three groups: ACL group—after ACL rupture and reconstruction, mild injury group—post mild lower limb injuries, and the control group—without injuries. They performed five tests: Functional Movement Screen, Tuck Jump Assessment, Y-balance Test, Hop Test for Distance, and Isokinetic Test. The Composite Score of Readiness (CSR) index was calculated and expressed as the sum of z-scores. The multiple regression model for all tests was calculated, and then redundant variables were excluded. We observed that all tests significantly influenced the final CSR index. The Y-balance Test, Tuck Jump Assessment, and Isokinetic Test for knee flexion influenced the final CSR index the most, which means that these tests are greatly indicative of functional deficits related to ACL reconstruction. The strength of the extensor (quadriceps) muscle and the quadriceps/hamstring ratio appeared to be non-sensitive for testing functional deficits related to ACL reconstruction. If the test battery includes 4–5 tests, it better differentiates the athletes following ACL reconstruction from those after mild injuries, even if they all were cleared to play.",1
The Effect of Fatigue on Trunk and Pelvic Jump-Landing Biomechanics in View of Lower Extremity Loading: A Systematic Review,2023-01-20,2023,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Vermeulen Stefan, De Bleecker Camilla, De Blaiser Cedric, Onursal Kilinc Özge, Willems Tine, Vanrenterghem Jos, Roosen Philip, De Ridder Roel","Fatigue has often been considered a risk factor for developing sports injuries, modulating lower extremity jump-landing biomechanics. The impact of fatigue on proximal trunk and pelvic biomechanics has been suggested to play an important role in lower extremity loading and injury risk, yet the available evidence remains ambiguous as the trunk and pelvis were often not the primary focus of research. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to determine how fatigue affects trunk and pelvic three-dimensional jump-landing biomechanics. PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were consulted up to and including April 2022 for potential studies investigating the effect of fatigue on trunk and pelvic kinematics, kinetics and/or muscular activity during jump-landing tasks in healthy, physically active populations. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed by the modified Downs and Black checklist. Twenty-one studies were included and methodological quality was moderate to high among these studies. The results indicate prevailing evidence for more trunk flexion during standardized jump-landing tasks after lower extremity muscle fatigue. Otherwise, lumbo-pelvic-hip muscle fatigue does not seem to elicit major detrimental changes to these jump-landing biomechanics. Although a wide variability of trunk and pelvic jump-landing strategies was observed, the results provide evidence for increased trunk flexion after lower extremity muscle fatigue. This proximal strategy is suggested to help unload fatigued lower extremity structures and lack of this compensation might increase knee injury risk.",1
Concurrent and Angle-Trajectory Validity and Intra-Trial Reliability of a Novel Multi-View Image-Based Motion Analysis System,2023-01-20,2023,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Journal of Human Kinetics,"Namgo Lee, Junghoon Ahn, Wootaek Lim","Sports-related injuries are the most common in the lower extremities among physical regions. To evaluate impaired functional performance in sports training facilities and sports, a marker-less motion analysis system that can measure joint kinematics in bright indoor and outdoor environments is required. The aim of this study was to establish the concurrent and angle-trajectory validity and intra-trial reliability of a novel multi-view image-based motion analysis system with marker-less pose estimation during lower extremity tasks in healthy young men. Ten healthy young men participated voluntarily in this study. The hip and knee joint angles were collected using a multi-view image-based motion analysis system (marker-less) and a Vicon motion capture system (with markers) during the lower extremity tasks. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses were used to identify the concurrent and angle-trajectory validity and intra-trial reliability of the multi-view image-based motion analysis system. In the concurrent validity, the correlation analysis revealed that the ICC3, k values on the hip and knee flexions during knee bending in sitting, standing, and squat movements were from 0.747 to 0.936 between the two systems. In particular, the angle-trajectory validity was very high (ICC3, 1 = 0.859-0.998), indicating a high agreement between the two systems. The intra-trial reliability of each system was excellent (ICC3, 1 = 0.773-0.974), reflecting high reproducibility. We suggest that this novel marker-less motion analysis system is highly accurate and reliable for measuring joint kinematics of the lower extremities during the rehabilitation process and monitoring sports performance of athletes in training facilities.",1
Does fatigue influence joint‐specific work and ground force production during the first steps of maximal acceleration?,2023-01-18,2023,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Shayne Vial, Jodie Cochrane Wilkie, Mitchell Turner, Mark Scanlan, Anthony J. Blazevich","During initial acceleration, the first steps of a maximal-effort (sprint) run often determine success or failure in the capture and evasion of an opponent, and is therefore a vital factor of success in many modern sports. However, accelerative events are commonly performed after having already run considerable distances, and the associated fatigue should impair muscle force production and thus reduce acceleration. Despite this, the effects of running-induced fatigue on our ability to accelerate as well as the running technique used to achieve it have received little attention. We recorded 3-D kinematics and ground reaction forces during the first three steps of the acceleration phase from a standing start before and after performing a high-speed, multi-directional, fatiguing run-walk protocol in well-trained running athletes who were habituated to accelerative sprinting. We found that the athletes were able to maintain their acceleration despite changing running technique, which was associated with use of a more upright posture, longer ground contact time, increased vertical ground reaction impulse, decreased hip flexion and extension velocities, and a shift in peak joint moments, power, and positive work from the hip to the knee joint; no changes were detected in ankle joint function. Thus, a compensatory increase in knee joint function alleviated the reduction in hip flexor-extensor capacity. These acute adaptations may indicate that the hip extensors (gluteal and hamstring muscle groups) were more susceptible to fatigue than the ankle and knee musculature, and may thus be a primary target for interventions promoting fatigue resistance.",1

HSI often recur and many areas are lacking evidence and guidance for optimal rehabilitation. This study aimed to develop an international expert consensus for the management of HSI. A modified Delphi methodology and consensus process was used with an international expert panel, involving two rounds of online questionnaires and an intermediate round involving a consensus meeting. The initial information gathering round questionnaire was sent to 46 international experts, which comprised open-ended questions covering decision-making domains in HSI. Thematic analysis of responses outlined key domains, which were evaluated by a smaller international subgroup (n=15), comprising clinical academic sports medicine physicians, physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons in a consensus meeting. After group discussion around each domain, a series of consensus statements were prepared, debated and refined. A round 2 questionnaire was sent to 112 international hamstring experts to vote on these statements and determine level of agreement. Consensus threshold was set a priori at 70%. Expert response rates were 35/46 (76%) (first round), 15/35 (attendees/invitees to meeting day) and 99/112 (88.2%) for final survey round. Statements on rehabilitation reaching consensus centred around: exercise selection and dosage (78.8%-96.3% agreement), impact of the kinetic chain (95%), criteria to progress exercise (73%-92.7%), running and sprinting (83%-100%) in rehabilitation and criteria for return to sport (RTS) (78.3%-98.3%). Benchmarks for flexibility (40%) and strength (66.1%) and adjuncts to rehabilitation (68.9%) did not reach agreement. This consensus panel recommends individualised rehabilitation based on the athlete, sporting demands, involved muscle(s) and injury type and severity (89.8%). Early-stage rehab should avoid high strain loads and rates. Loading is important but with less consensus on optimum progression and dosage. This panel recommends rehabilitation progress based on capacity and symptoms, with pain thresholds dependent on activity, except pain-free criteria supported for sprinting (85.5%). Experts focus on the demands and capacity required for match play when deciding the rehabilitation end goal and timing of RTS (89.8%). The expert panellists in this study followed evidence on aspects of rehabilitation after HSI, suggesting rehabilitation prescription should be individualised, but clarified areas where evidence was lacking. Additional research is required to determine the optimal load dose, timing and criteria for HSI rehabilitation and the monitoring and testing metrics to determine safe rapid progression in rehabilitation and safe RTS. Further research would benefit optimising: prescription of running and sprinting, the application of adjuncts in rehabilitation and treatment of kinetic chain HSI factors.",1

However, classification systems lack reliability and validity data and are not specific to individual hamstring muscles, potentially missing parameters vital for sport-specific and activity-specific decision making. A narrative evidence review was conducted followed by a modified Delphi study to build an international consensus on best-practice decision-making for the classification of hamstring injuries. This comprised a digital information gathering survey to a cohort of 46 international hamstring experts (sports medicine physicians, physiotherapists, surgeons, trainers and sports scientists) who were also invited to a face-to-face consensus group meeting in London . Fifteen of these expert clinicians attended to synthesise and refine statements around the management of hamstring injury. A second digital survey was sent to a wider group of 112 international experts. Acceptance was set at 70% agreement. Rounds 1 and 2 survey response rates were 35/46 (76%) and 99/112 (88.4%) of experts responding. Most commonly, experts used the British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification (BAMIC) (58%), Munich (12%) and Barcelona (6%) classification systems for hamstring injury. Issues identified to advance imaging classifications systems include: detailing individual hamstring muscles, establishing optimal use of imaging in diagnosis and classification, and testing the validity and reliability of classification systems. The most used hamstring injury classification system is the BAMIC. This consensus panel recommends hamstring injury classification systems evolve to integrate imaging and clinical parameters around: individual muscles, injury mechanism, sporting demand, functional criteria and patient-reported outcome measures. More research is needed on surgical referral and effectiveness criteria, and validity and reliability of classification systems to guide management.",1

Rupture of the ACL usually occurs in active and young people. For a correct diagnosis it is necessary a good clinical history, examination and a complementary study. The literature recommends surgical treatment in athletes and young people. Objective: to detail current information related to anterior cruciate ligament injury, embryology, anatomy, biomechanics, incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, management, approach and treatment of the disease. Methodology: a total of 72 articles were analyzed in this review, including review and original articles, as well as clinical cases, of which 46 bibliographies were used because the other articles were not relevant to this study. The sources of information were PubMed, Google Scholar, SciELO and Cochrane; the terms used to search for information in Spanish, Portuguese, German and English were: ACL, anterior cruciate ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, Vordere Kreuzband. Results: ACL deficiency not only causes instability episodes but also changes in joint mechanics that may lead to degenerative changes. Meniscal lesions are linked to 50% of these injuries. The Lachman test is the most accurate clinical diagnostic test, with a reported combined sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 94%. The anterior drawer test has high sensitivity and specificity for chronic ACL tears (92% sensitivity and 91% specificity), but lower accuracy for acute cases. In MRI, the following statistics were found in patients with acute ACL injuries in several studies: specificity 98-100% and sensitivity 94%. Conclusions: The ACL is a specialized band of connective tissue located in the knee joint that joins the tibia and femur. It consists primarily of collagen fibers, making up 70% of its dry weight.Variation in the anatomy of the intercondylar groove of the distal femur is a factor that appears to be related to an increased risk of ACL injury. ACL injuries are rarely diagnosed with an MRI, but in some circumstances, such as a meniscal tear or bone contusion, this test may be useful. The decision on the course of treatment for a patient with an ACL injury depends on a number of variables. Surgical reconstruction in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears has proven to be a very effective technique that usually provides satisfactory results. Patients with ACL insufficiency may receive conservative treatment, which may involve activity modification, rehabilitation, and sometimes bracing. Proprioception and strength deficits should be taken into account when designing rehabilitation programs for knees with ACL insufficiency. KEY WORDS: ligament, anterior cruciate, ACL, rupture.",1
Comparison of player perceptions to mechanical measurements of third generation synthetic turf football surfaces,2023-01-15,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"David Cole, Paul Fleming, Jon Roberts, David James, Mickael Benetti, Katharina Wistel, Johsan Billingham, Steph Forrester","Abstract Mechanical testing of synthetic turf football surfaces is considered essential to ensure player performance and safety. However, it remains unknown how well the mechanical outputs reflect player perceptions of these surfaces. The first objective of this study was to investigate the agreement between the outputs from the Rotational Traction Tester and the Advanced Artificial Athlete with player perceptions across a range of controlled third generation turf football surfaces. The second objective was to identify the modifications to the Rotational Traction Tester and the Advanced Artificial Athlete configurations and output variables that give the strongest agreement with player perceptions. An indoor test area containing ten third generation turf surfaces with controlled hardness and traction properties was constructed. Each surface was tested using the Advanced Artificial Athlete and Rotational Traction Tester in their current configuration and in several modified configurations aimed at better replicating the player–surface interaction. Using a trained panel paired comparisons technique, 18 University footballers (11 males and 7 females) identified differences in the surfaces based on four sensory attributes Movement Speed , Slip , Leg Shock and Give . Results indicated strong agreement (correlation coefficients between 0.7 and 1.0) across several Rotational Traction Tester and Advanced Artificial Athlete testing configurations and output variables with player perceptions. It is recommended that the current Rotational Traction Tester is improved through added instrumentation to allow surface stiffness to be evaluated (the rate of generation of traction resistance). It is further recommended that the Advanced Artificial Athlete adopts a new algorithm to improve the accuracy of the surface’s Vertical Deformation and Energy Restitution, and the number of drops is reduced from three to one.",1
Predicting injury risk using machine learning in male youth soccer players,2023-01-14,2023,Elsevier BV,"Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals","Francisco Javier Robles-Palazón, José M. Puerta-Callejón, José A. Gámez, Mark De Ste Croix, Antonio Cejudo, Fernando Santonja, Pilar Sainz de Baranda, Francisco Ayala","The aim of this study was twofold: a) to build models using machine learning techniques on data from an extensive screening battery to prospectively predict lower extremity soft tissue (LE-ST) injuries in non-elite male youth soccer players, and b) to compare models' performance scores (i.e., predictive accuracy) to select the best fit. A sample of 260 male youth soccer players from the academies of five different Spanish non-professional clubs completed the follow-up. Players were engaged in a pre-season assessment that covered several personal characteristics (e.g., anthropometric measures), psychological constructs (e.g., trait-anxiety), and physical fitness and neuromuscular measures (e.g., range of motion [ROM], landing kinematics). Afterwards, all LE-ST injuries were monitored over one competitive season. The predictive ability (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] and F-score) of several screening models was analysed and compared to select the one with the highest scores. A total of 45 LE-ST injuries were recorded over the season. The best fit screening model developed (AUC = 0.700, F-score = 0.380) allowed to successfully identify one in two (True Positive rate = 53.7 %) and three in four (True Negative rate = 73.9 %) players at high or low risk of suffering a LE-ST injury throughout the in-season phase, respectively, using a subset of six field-based measures (knee medial displacement in the drop jump, asymmetry in the peak vertical ground reaction force during landing, body mass index, asymmetry in the frontal plane projection angle assessed through the tuck jump, asymmetry in the passive hip internal rotation ROM, and ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended ROM). Given that these measures require little equipment to be recorded and can be employed quickly (approximately 5–10 min) and easily by trained staff in a single player, the model developed might be included in the injury management strategy for youth soccer.",1

However, the evidence is not well-known regarding the in-season effects of biological age (peak height velocity—PHV) on the motor adaptive processes following combined plyometric and COD with ball training (P-CODBT) in youth soccer players. This study aimed to examine the in-season effects of P-CODBT (8 weeks and twice a week) on the athletic performances of male youth soccer players, circa- and post-PHV. In a randomized controlled training study with pre-to-post measurements, forty-eight male players were assigned into two experimental (performing P-CODBT; n = 12 × circa-PHV and n = 12 × post-PHV) and two control groups (CONG; n = 12 × circa-PHV and n = 12 × post-PHV). The pre- and post-training participants were assessed for their anthropometric, linear sprinting with and without a ball, COD speed with and without a ball, vertical jump, dynamic balance, and endurance-intensive performances. After the intervention, the experimental condition induced significant (all p < 0.0001) and small to large effect size (ES = 0.263−3.471) additional gains only on explosive measures compared to CONG. Both the experimental (all p < 0.0001; ES = 0.338−1.908) and control (p = 0.011−0.0001; ES = 0.2−1.8) groups improved their athletic performances over the training period. The improvements generated by p-CODBT were not affected by biological age. In-season short-term P-CODBT (twice a week) could be safe way to generate benefits in explosive performances in youth soccer players, which are relevant components of match-winning actions in soccer.",1

Methods The data in this study were presented based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Using scientific databases and web search engines including Scopus, Ebscohost, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar, researchers collected studies from the published literature. Only 26 of the 84 articles satisfied all the inclusion criteria and were thus included in the systematic review. The quality of each study was determined using the PEDro scale. The scores for 26 studies range between three and six. Results Core training can improve soccer players' skill-related physical fitness, including their power, speed, balance, and agility. Conclusion The core is the anatomic and functional center of the body as well as its “engine.” All movements emanate from the center of the body and are transmitted to the extremities. The core muscles differ from the limb muscles because they frequently cocontract, thus making the torso hard to the point whereby all the muscles work together to become synergists. Theoretically, a strong core permits the passage of force from the lower body to the upper body with minimal energy loss in the torso. Based on the 26 studies, this review suggests that core training should be incorporated into the daily training sessions of soccer players, with a minimum frequency and length of 15 min per training session, twice per week, for 4 weeks.

The Assessment of Ankle Range-of-Motion and Its Relationship with Overall Muscle Strength in a Cross-Section of Soccer Players,2023-01-05,2023,MDPI AG,Sports,"Piergiorgio Francia, Carlo Ferri Marini, Leonardo Bocchi, Barbara Piccini, Giuseppe Seghieri, Ario Federici, Sonia Toni, Francesco Lucertini","Soccer (football) practice can induce a limitation of ankle range of motion (ROM) that is a possible risk factor for injury and other negative consequences over time. The main objective of this research was to investigate the effects of soccer practice on ankle ROM throughout the entire period of a sports career of soccer players (SP). Furthermore, the relationship between ankle ROM and muscle strength in SP of different ages was studied. A total of 204 SP (range 6.7–45.1 years) and 87 controls (range: 7.5–45.2 years) matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and gender, were assessed. Ankle ROM in both plantar flexion (APF) and dorsiflexion (ADF) in addition to handgrip strength (HGS) were evaluated using an inclinometer and the Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer, respectively. The comparison between SP and control groups showed a significant reduction in ankle ROM of both APF (26.3 ± 7.2° vs. 32.6 ± 7.4°; d = −0.90; p &lt; 0.001) and ADF (95.5 ± 15.6° vs. 105.5 ± 15.8°; d = −0.66; p &lt; 0.001). In SP, the results of the ANOVAs test indicate that age had a significant effect on ADF (F = 4.352, p = 0.038, partial eta-squared (ηp2) = 0.015) but not on APF (F = 0.430, p = 0.746, ηp2 = 0.001). Moreover, considering only the SP, a weak inverse correlation between ADF and HGS group ADF was found (rs = −0.27; p &lt; 0.001). Factors such as the non-linear trend of growth in young SP could hinder the definition of the relationship between ankle ROM, age, and muscle strength. However, the appropriate consideration of age and muscle strength could facilitate the management of ankle ROM in PF of different ages.",1
Biomechanics and lower limb function are altered in athletes and runners with achilles tendinopathy compared with healthy controls: A systematic review,2023-01-04,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Andrew Quarmby, Jamal Mönnig, Hendrik Mugele, Jakob Henschke, MyoungHwee Kim, Michael Cassel, Tilman Engel","Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a debilitating injury in athletes, especially for those engaged in repetitive stretch-shortening cycle activities. Clinical risk factors are numerous, but it has been suggested that altered biomechanics might be associated with AT. No systematic review has been conducted investigating these biomechanical alterations in specifically athletic populations. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to compare the lower-limb biomechanics of athletes with AT to athletically matched asymptomatic controls. Databases were searched for relevant studies investigating biomechanics during gait activities and other motor tasks such as hopping, isolated strength tasks, and reflex responses. Inclusion criteria for studies were an AT diagnosis in at least one group, cross-sectional or prospective data, at least one outcome comparing biomechanical data between an AT and healthy group, and athletic populations. Studies were excluded if patients had Achilles tendon rupture/surgery, participants reported injuries other than AT, and when only within-subject data was available.. Effect sizes (Cohen's d ) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for relevant outcomes. The initial search yielded 4,442 studies. After screening, twenty studies (775 total participants) were synthesised, reporting on a wide range of biomechanical outcomes. Females were under-represented and patients in the AT group were three years older on average. Biomechanical alterations were identified in some studies during running, hopping, jumping, strength tasks and reflex activity. Equally, several biomechanical variables studied were not associated with AT in included studies, indicating a conflicting picture. Kinematics in AT patients appeared to be altered in the lower limb, potentially indicating a pattern of “medial collapse”. Muscular activity of the calf and hips was different between groups, whereby AT patients exhibited greater calf electromyographic amplitudes despite lower plantar flexor strength. Overall, dynamic maximal strength of the plantar flexors, and isometric strength of the hips might be reduced in the AT group. This systematic review reports on several biomechanical alterations in athletes with AT. With further research, these factors could potentially form treatment targets for clinicians, although clinical approaches should take other contributing health factors into account. The studies included were of low quality, and currently no solid conclusions can be drawn.",1
"Correlations between linear sprint with the ball, linear sprint without the ball, and change-of-direction without the ball in professional female soccer players",2023-01-02,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Artur Avelino Birk Preissler, Pedro Schons, Filipe Manuel Clemente, Guilherme Droescher de Vargas, Lucas Moraes Klein, Ana Filipa Silva, Hadi Nobari, Luiz Fernando Martins Kruel","Abstract The evolution of female soccer is related to the increase in high-intensity actions and choosing the abilities that best characterize the players' performance. Determining the capabilities that best describe the players' performance becomes essential for coaches and technical staff to obtain the results more efficiently within the competitive calendar. Thus, the study aimed to analyze the correlations between performance in the 20-m sprint tests with and without the ball and the Zigzag 20-m change-of-direction (COD) test without the ball in professional female soccer players. Thirty-three high-level professional female soccer players performed the 20-m sprint tests without a ball, 20-m sprint tests with the ball, and the Zigzag 20-m COD test without the ball. The shortest time obtained in the three trials was used for each test. The fastest time in the three trials was used for each test to calculate the average test speed. The Pearson product–moment correlation test was applied to analyze the correlation between the performance in the tests. Pearson's product–moment correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the performance in the trials, with a significance level of α &lt; 0.05. The average speed in the 20-m sprint tests with ball showed very large and significant correlations with the speed in the Zigzag 20-m COD test (r = 0.822; p &lt; 0.001; 95% CI = 0.666 to 0.909). The 20-m sprint tests with ball and 20-m sprint tests without ball showed moderate, positive and significant correlation (r = 0.363; p = 0.038; 95% CI = 0.023–0.628). The tests of 20-m sprint tests without ball and Zigzag 20-m COD test also showed moderate, positive and significant correlation (r = 0.415; p = 0.016; 95% CI = 0.084–0.664). The female–female soccer players with a better ability to change direction may also have a better technical ability to drive the ball at high speed. However, they will not necessarily be the fastest in the linear sprint without the ball. Coaches and technical staff may choose to perform tests seeking efficiency and practicality, especially in a congested competitive period.",1

Hughes, Volker Musahl","Abstract Postoperative patient satisfaction after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL‐R) is influenced mainly by the degree of pain, the need for reoperation, and functional performance in daily activities and sports. Graft choice has shown to have an influence on postoperative outcomes after ACL‐R. While patient reported outcomes measurements do not differ between graft options, evidence shows that normal knee kinematics is not fully restored after ACL‐R with an increase in postoperative anterior tibial translation (ATT). Postoperative graft rupture rates seem to favor bone‐patella‐tendon‐bone (BPTB) and quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts over HT or allografts. While return to sports rates seem comparable between different graft types, postoperative extensor strength is reduced in patients with BPTB and QT whereas flexion strength is weakened in patients with HT. Postoperative donor site morbidity is highest in BPTB but comparable between HT and QT. With all graft options having advantages and drawbacks, graft choice must be individualized and chosen in accordance with the patient.",1

Spontaneous healing of a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament: a case series and literature review,2023-01-01,2023,Wiley,Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics,"Leonardo Previ, Edoardo Monaco, Alessandro Carrozzo, Gianluca Fedeli, Alessandro Annibaldi, Matteo Romano Cantagalli, Giorgio Rossi, Andrea Ferretti","The anterior cruciate ligament is probably one of the ligaments with the lowest healing potential. Many authors have reported cases of spontaneous healing but nowadays it is difficult to predict successful healing of an anterior cruciate ligament rupture and, even more, residual functionality and capability to return to sport. The aim of this study was to investigate cases of spontaneous healing in a population that received non-surgical treatment after anterior cruciate ligament rupture and to perform an updated review of contemporary literature.The authors retrospectively reviewed patients who suffered from an acute complete anterior cruciate ligament rupture and underwent non-surgical treatment. No specific rehabilitation protocol was prescribed. A new magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted 6 months after the injury for all patients. A literature review was conducted regarding spontaneous healing of the anterior cruciate ligament. The papers included in the analysis were reports of any level of evidence, written in English, Italian, or French languages; articles were excluded if they reported non-human studies, histological studies, studies conducted without magnetic resonance imaging or arthroscopic second look, or partial anterior cruciate ligament tear.Case series: Six patients were enrolled in the study. All patients had a proximal anterior cruciate ligament lesion. The minimum follow-up was 13 months (range 6-20 months). At the last follow-up the mean score on the Lysholm scale was 97, the mean IKDC score was 94, and the mean KOOS score was 96. All patients returned to their own sport activities; no one reported significant differences. The magnetic resonance imaging study at 6 months revealed an end-to-end continuous anterior cruciate ligament with homogeneous signal. No one had any new knee injury at last follow-up.A search of comprehensive databases retrieved 1057 articles; 8 full-text articles met the eligibility criteria. The studies were heterogeneous regarding the populations analysed, sport activity level, treatment applied, healing definition, and follow-up. The failure rate of non-surgical management ranged among the papers from 0 to 73%.The study findings show that spontaneous anterior cruciate ligament healing is possible and there are chances of clinical recovery for patients not suitable for surgery. However, there is still a lack of evidence about predictors, clinical outcomes, and adequate rehabilitation protocols.",1

MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases were searched from 2000 to May, 2022 using a combination of keywords and their variations: ""anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction"" OR ""ACLR"", ""electromyography"" OR ""EMG"", ""running"", ""jumping"" OR ""landing"", ""cutting"" OR ""change-of-direction"" OR ""CoD"". The search identified studies comparing EMG data during running, landing and cutting/(CoD) between the involved limb and contralateral or control limbs. Risk of bias was assessed and quantitative analyses using effect sizes were performed.Thirty two studies met the inclusion criteria. Seventy five percent (24/32) of the studies reported altered EMG activity pattern of the ACLR leg during running, jumping/landing and cutting/(CoD) when compared with either the healthy control leg or the contra-lateral leg. Twelve studies showed decreased, delayed or earlier onset and delayed peak in quadriceps EMG activity with small to large effect sizes and 9 studies showed increased, delayed or earlier onset and delayed peak in hamstrings EMG activity with small to large effect sizes. Four studies showed a ""hamstrings-dominant"" strategy i.e. decreased quadriceps coupled with increased hamstrings EMG activity in both running and jumping/landing irrespective of graft type. One study reported that on the grounds of decreased quadriceps activity, lower hamstrings EMG activity was predictive of ipsilateral re-injury in ACLR patients.This systematic review of Level III evidence showed that the ACLR leg displays decreased quadriceps or increased hamstrings EMG activity or both despite RTS. Simultaneous decreased quadriceps and increased hamstrings EMG activity was shown for both running and jumping/landing. From a clinical perspective this ""hamstrings dominant"" strategy can serve as a protective mechanism against graft re-injury.III.",1
The Risk Factors and Preventive Strategies of Poor Knee Functions and Osteoarthritis after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Narrative Review,2023-01-01,2023,Japanese Physical Therapy Association,Physical Therapy Research,"I Putu Gde Surya ADHITYA, Ida KURNIAWATI, Ryuichi SAWA, Tabita Febyola WIJAYA, Ni Putu Aprilia Chintya DEWI","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is the standard surgical treatment for ACL injury, which typically uses a graft to replace the torn ligament in the knee that uses small incisions with minimally invasive surgery. The optimal knee functions following ACLR depend on rehabilitation processes before and after the surgery. Knee function is the ability of the knee to perform various types of functional movements like walking, squatting, running, jumping, and pivoting where patients expect to achieve maximum knee function or at least more than 80% of its initial condition before the injury to avoid being categorized as poor knee function after ACLR. Patients use patient-reported outcome measures to collect data on their health status and quality of life after ACLR. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a type of OA that manifests in local cartilage injury caused by chondrocyte death, and matrix dispersion occurs following a joint injury like ACL injury. Gender, time from injury to surgery, and graft type were considered as risk factors for poor knee function after ACLR, while overweight, meniscus tear, and cartilage defect as risk factors for PTOA. However, age is an internal risk factor for both poor knee function and PTOA following ACLR. This review suggests several strategies to prevent both conditions, including a pre-operative program, comprehensive rehabilitation, body weight control, and return to sport (RTS) consideration based on physical capacity, proper time, and psychological readiness.",1
Influences of trunk stability on exercise performance of closed kinetic chain of upper and lower limbs,2023-01-01,2023,Society of Physical Therapy Science,Journal of Physical Therapy Science,"Obu Horii, Makoto Sasaki","[Purpose] This study aimed to examine whether trunk stability is related to closed kinetic chain motor performance of the upper and lower limbs. [Participants and Methods] In this study, 27 healthy male university students participated. Trunk stability was measured under two conditions, with and without rhythmic stabilization, as a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation procedure. The shortest time required to perform 20 push-ups and lateral step-up/-downs (closed kinetic chain motor performances) immediately after rhythmic stabilization or sitting rest (without rhythmic stabilization) was measured. [Results] Left and right trunk stabilities were significantly higher, and the time required to perform the closed kinetic chain motor task was significantly shorter under the rhythmic stabilization condition than that of the non-rhythmic stabilization condition. Regarding the relationship between the difference between the two trunk stability conditions and difference between upper/lower limbs closed kinetic chain exercise capacity conditions, left trunk stability correlated with each closed kinetic chain movement, whereas right trunk stability did not correlate with either movement. [Conclusion] Trunk stability was shown to improve closed kinetic chain exercise capacity in the upper and lower limbs, and stability of the trunk's dominant side (here, left side) seemed to regulate.",1

Muscle inertial contributions to ankle kinetics during the swing phase of running,2023-01-01,2023,Elsevier BV,Journal of Biomechanics,"Jasper Verheul, Shinjiro Sueda, Sang-Hoon Yeo","Skeletal muscles have inertia that leads to inertial forces acting around joints. Although these inertial muscle forces contribute to joint kinetics, they are not typically accounted for in musculoskeletal models used for human movement biomechanics research. Ignoring inertial forces can lead to errors in joint kinetics, but how large these errors are in inverse dynamics calculations of common movements is yet unclear. We, therefore, examined the role of shank muscle inertia on ankle joint moments during the swing phase of running at different speeds. A custom musculoskeletal modelling and simulation platform was used to perform inverse dynamics with a model that either combined muscle mass in the total shank mass, or considered the gastrocnemius lateralis/medialis, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles as separate masses from the shank. Ankle moments were considerably affected when muscles were modelled as separate masses, with a general shift towards reduced dorsiflexion and higher plantarflexion moments. Differences between both modelling conditions increased with running speed and ranged between 0.8 and 1.6 Nm (ankle moment profile root mean square error), 8–18 % (peak dorsiflexion moment difference) and 24–42 % (peak plantarflexion moment difference). Moreover, we observed a complex combination of inertial forces, especially those due to rotation and translation of the shank, in which the direction of inertial force changed during the swing phase. These results show that ignoring muscle inertia in musculoskeletal models can lead to under- or overestimations of structure-specific loads and thus erroneous study conclusions. Our results suggest that muscle inertial forces should be carefully considered when using musculoskeletal models.",1

Effect of foot strike patterns and cutting angles on knee kinematics and kinetics during side-cutting maneuvers,2023-01-01,2023,Politechnika Wroclawska Oficyna Wydawnicza,Acta of Bioengineering and Biomechanics,"Wenxing Zhou, Yujie Qi, Mengjun Liu, Chengpang Hsiao, Lin Wang","Purpose Cutting maneuvers are important actions in multidirectional sports but associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different foot strike patterns and cutting angles on knee kinematics and kinetics. Methods Twenty healthy male team sports athletes performed cuts with maximum speed at three angles (45°, 90°, and 135°) with different foot strike patterns (rearfoot strike [RFS] and forefoot strike [FFS]). A three-dimensional motion capture system combined with a force plate was used to collect makers trajectory and ground reaction force (GRF). Vertical GRF, and knee joint angles and moments were compared among these cutting tasks. Results Regardless of foot strike patterns, increased knee flexion angle, knee valgus moment, and knee internal rotation moment were observed during cutting to sharper angles (p &lt; 0.001). At 90° and 135°, the FFS condition remained in a varus position and showed lower knee flexion moment than the RFS condition (p ≤ 0.004). However, no significant differences in knee kinematic and kinetic variables were found between foot strike patterns during cutting to 45°. Conclusions These findings suggest that sharper cutting angles potentially increase the risk of ACL injury. Compared with the RFS pattern, the FFS pattern induces a slight knee varus angle and a lower knee flexion moment at sharper angles, which might further reduce the load placed on the knee.",1

Biomechanical factors play a significant role in determining ball speed. However, further investigation is needed to understand the specific relationships between the biomechanical factors and post-strike ball velocity in football players. Aim: To identify the key biomechanical factors contributing to post-strike ball velocity and provide insights for enhancing performance in league-level football players. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine at the Sri Ramachandra Centre for Sports Science, Tamil Nadu, India. The duration of the study was five months, from January 2022 to May 2022. The study included 25 professional male football players from national-level league teams. Participants performed maximal instep kicks while various kinematic variables were measured using Vicon cameras, Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., (AMTI) force footplates, and a radar speed gun. Data processing was performed using Vicon Nexus software version 2.7. The data were analysed using R statistical software version 4.0.2. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc tests, were used to compare the various kick matrices across the players. Pearson’s r correlation analysis was used to check for a correlation between post-strike ball velocity and other kick matrices. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative effects of various kick matrices on post-strike ball velocity, with significance set at a p-value &lt;0.05. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 18.8 years. A significant positive correlation was observed between prestrike foot velocity (r=0.58) and training experience (r=0.48) with post-strike ball velocity. Step-wise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that 39% of the variance in post-strike ball velocity could be attributed to training experience and prestrike foot velocity. Conclusion: Training experience and prestrike foot velocity could be the most important factors to consider in order to maximise post-strike ball velocity among league-level football players.",1
Understanding the impact of hamstring injuries on match performance in Spanish professional soccer players<b> </b>,2023-01-01,2023,"Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb",Kinesiology,"Javier Raya-González, Tomás García-Calvo, Daniel Rojas-Valverde, Roberto López del Campo, Ricardo Resta, Jesus Diaz-García","This study aimed to analyze the changes in match physical demands in professional soccer players after sustaining a hamstring injury, which was categorized based on injury severity. Seventy-two hamstring injuries involving sixty-four professional soccer players from the Spanish LaLiga™ were considered for this study. All injuries were classified according to their severity as moderate (resulting in eight to 28 missed days) and major (resulting in more than 28 missed days). Mediacoach video-tracking system collected time and external load variables and subsequently compared them between the pre-injury and return-to-play periods. The analyzed variables included distance covered at different velocities (i.e., total distance, at 18-21 km.h−1, at 21-24 km.h−1, and at more than 24 km.h-1), the number of sprints, accelerations, decelerations, and high metabolic load distance (HMLD). The results showed that players with both moderate and major injuries played fewer minutes after injury (p&amp;lt;.001 to p&amp;lt;.05) and experienced a decrease in maximum speed (p&amp;lt;.01 to p&amp;lt;.05), covering less total distance (p&amp;lt;.05) and exhibiting a decrease (p&amp;lt;.05) in average speed (only observed in players with major injuries). Additionally, moderately injured players experienced a reduction in the number of maximum accelerations (p&amp;lt;.05) and decelerations (p&amp;lt;.05), high metabolic load distance/min (p&amp;lt;.05), and average accelerations (p&amp;lt;.05). Furthermore, a significant reduction in the magnitude of maximum decelerations was observed in players with major injuries (p&amp;lt;.05). These findings highlight the importance of implementing strategies that enable the attainment of initial levels of high-intensity actions and maximum speed in reconditioning programs following hamstring injuries.",1
Mimicking Gait Dynamics: A Step Toward Precision Learning of Human Activities,2023-01-01,2023,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Access,"Xi Yang, Fushing Hsieh","We develop a computational protocol for mimicking personal gait dynamics with 12-dimensional time series derived from 4 accelerometer sensors found in the MAREA database and then explore its utilities in line with precision learning of human activities. The foundation of mimicking high dimensional rhythmic dynamics is explicitly established upon deterministic and stochastic structures found on structural representations of evolving biomechanical states hidden within all computed gait cycles. Such a technique enables practitioners to detect and confirm minute structural changes that could last for only a few cycles with high precision. Our computational developments are step-by-step illustrated via one subject's data, while the other 8 subjects' data are also analyzed and compared accordingly. A common cyclic composition of evolving biomechanical states of various temporal scales emerges from the 9 subjects' comparisons. We conclude that mimicking an individual's gait dynamics offers precise detections of potential multiscale minute differences against gait dynamics of different time periods or of different persons, and further offers clues of efficiency on personal walking activity. This mimicking-based capability is a cornerstone for the proof of concept: dynamics mimicking enables precision learning by improving the efficiency of learning and performing human activities in competitive sports, social dancing, and physical rehabilitation, among many others.",1
EVALUATION OF ANKLE MOVEMENTS ON A SUDDEN INVERSION PLATFORM,2023-01-01,2023,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte,"Leandro Dias dos Santos, César Augusto Martins Pereira, Raul Bolligner Neto, Angélica Castilho Alonso, Júlia Maria D'Andrea Greve","ABSTRACT Introduction: Ankle sprains are frequent in sports activities and can lead to joint instability with clinical and performance consequences. Sudden ankle inversion platforms have been used to study the mechanism of ankle sprain. Objectives: To test a static platform that simulates the movement of ankle sprain (sudden inversion) in soccer players. Methods: A platform was developed to perform the sudden movement of an ankle sprain dissociated in three axes: inversion, plantar flexion, and medial rotation. A computer program was also created to read the angular velocity and the time to reach the maximum amplitude of the three axes of movement, synchronized with the platform movements. Thirty soccer players without ankle sprains were evaluated on the sudden inversion platform. Each athlete performed 10 randomly initiated tests, with five per leg. Results: There was no statistical difference in angular velocity or time to reach maximum range of motion of plantar flexion and medial rotation between the tests. During the tests, the angular velocity of the inversion increased. Conclusion: The sudden static platform evaluated the movements performed by the ankle during the sprain reliably in the 10 tests with no difference in the mechanical behavior.

VERTICAL JUMPING CAPACITY AND CARDIAC ADAPTATIONS: IS THERE A LINK IN SOCCER PLAYERS?,2023-01-01,2023,Clinical Exercise Physiology Association,Journal of Clinical Exercise Physiology,"Vassilios Panoutsakopoulos, Nikolaos Koutlianos, Zacharias Papadakis, Evangelia Kouidi","https://youtu.be/OpSY8X_Nlf0 BACKGROUND Athletes' cardiac screening is challenging. The distinction between abnormal and normal is further hindered by the fact that cardiac adaptations differ between endurance and power athletes. Soccer performance depends on both cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. Most of the studies are focused on cardiac and aerobic adaptations related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but there is lack of studies examining musculoskeletal and anaerobic adaptations that elicit cardiac remodeling. The aim of this study was to examine whether the anaerobic jumping performance, as evaluated by vertical jump parameters achieved at a repetitive jump test (RVJ), was related to the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in Greek soccer players. METHODS/DESIGN Elite male professional players (N = 19, age = 25.7 ± 4.6 yrs) participated in this study as part of their annual physical and physiological performance screening. The participants performed a RVJ test consisted of 15 continuous maximal effort countermovement jumps. Echocardiography measurements of left ventricular mass (LVM) and body surface area (BSA) were used to calculate the LVMI as LVM/BSA in g/m2. LVMI value of 115 g/m2 is considered to be a cut-off value for LVH and two groups were additionally formed: group A with LVMI ≥ 115 g/m2 (n = 11) and group B with LVMI &amp;lt; 115 g/m2 (n = 8). Independent samples T-test was used to examine the maximum jump height (JHmax) difference between the groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was run to check the relationship between LVMI raw values and JHmax. Statistical analysis was performed using the R-based Jamovi software (version: 2.3.3.0), with the level of significance set at a = 0.05. RESULTS LVMI raw values were 143.14 ± 18.06 g/m2 and 108.22 ± 9.66 g/m2 in groups A and B, respectively. Group A had significantly lower JHmax compared to Group B (0.29 ± 0.04 m vs 0.35 ± 0.04 m, respectively; t17 =−3.39, p = 0.003, Hedges' g = 1.43: large effect size). In the total sample, LVMI raw values correlated significantly with JHmax (r = −0.53, p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS Soccer players with LVMI ≥ 115 g/m2 values had lower RVJ performance compared to those with LVMI &amp;lt; 115 g/m2. Resistance training, which is common in soccer, leads to cardiac anatomic adaptations such as LVH. The utility of the RVJ performance as a prognostic component for cardiac remodeling is weak. Even though soccer is a mixed type sport, aerobic adaptations are still the key prognostic elements for LVH.",1
Classification of Football Technique – Literature Review,2023-01-01,2023,"University of Maribor, University Press",42nd International Conference on Organizational Science Development,"Rok Vrban, Seamus Kelly, Mirjana Kljajić Borštnar","In this literature review we focus on classification of football technique elements and skills through successful practices and conducted studies. Football technique is one of the pillars of modern football player and team analysis and is defined as sport skill that has a certain way of solving a movement task (sport skill content) in accordance with the rules of the respective sport, the athlete’s biomechanical conditions and movement possibilities. Authors consider various features of football technique classification, such as difficulty of player movement, structure of player movement, type of player movement and playing position. Some of the fundamental techniques include kicking, dribbling and for goalkeepers catching the ball. Advanced technical skills include pendulum passing, leg scissor interception, etc. Based on game tactics, it also depends for players whether they are in possession of the ball or not. However, football technique can relate to various skills and attributes which are differently interpreted by authors. The aim of the review is to present key elements, skills and attributes observed in the previous research focusing technical skills in football. Moreover, the review focuses on comparative analysis of small-sided games technique evaluation, which serves as a cornerstone for football coaches in understanding the quality of the players. The results show that different sizes of the field, number of players on the pitch and overall quality of the players play an important role in successfully evaluating skill development.",1
A study on the diagnostic support system of the repetitive brain concussion based on the reconstruction analysis of the accident,2023-01-01,2023,University of Tokushima Faculty of Medicine,The Journal of Medical Investigation,"Shigeru Aomura, Hiromichi Nakadate, Yuelin Zhang, Takahiro Ueno, Akiyoshi Nishimura","In this paper the effectiveness of the support system which predicts the risk of the repetitive brain concussion is studied biomechanically. In the risk prediction system, the accident that caused the concussion is reconstructed by analyzing the game video via multibody dynamics and the resulting brain injury is calculated in detail by the finite element method. In order to calculate the aggravation of the brain injury by the repeated brain concussion, the following two methods are examined. In the first method, the material properties of the part of the brain damaged by the1st impact are changed in the simulation of the 2nd impact. In the second method, each brain damage caused by the repeated impacts is accumulated. The system was applied to the real-life accidents that occurred during Judo and American football games. As a result of the simulations, the aggravation of the brain damage due to repetitive concussion was determined numerically in terms of the maximum strain of the brain and the brain damage rate of the whole brain. The biomechanical process of the collision accidents and the resulting brain damage were reconstructed based on the video and the results are effective to prevent the future repeated concussion accidents.

Impact of Novel Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Device on Competitive Athlete Performance,2023-01-01,2023,"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.",Open Journal of Biophysics,"Dale C. Gledhill, Kade Huntsman, Gregory S. Anderson","The interaction of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) with the human body may result in a variety of positive outcomes including analgesia, enhanced healing, chondroprotection, cognitive improvement and better quality of life. Previous human studies have also revealed the potential of PEMF to enhance muscle function and athletic performance. To further evaluate this potential, an open label pilot study was conducted with 19 competitive cyclists who repeatedly participated in 63 training routes. Cyclist performance was tracked before and during use of a novel and portable PEMF device that is worn as a wristband. Comparison of performance before and during use of the wristband revealed a significant association with improved muscle power. The odds ratio was 3.02 (P < 0.01) for experiencing increased muscle power while wearing the PEMF device. Among the cycling routes in which an increase was observed, the average increase in power was about 9.8%. The data suggests the novel PEMF technology may be a safe and effective therapeutic approach for improved physical performance and likely involves improved oxygen delivery due to reduced rouleaux (erythrocyte aggregation).

A 5‐year follow‐up of Achilles tendon reconstruction using a full‐thickness graft processed with the clearant method and retrograde fixation in the calcaneus: a case study of an amateur soccer player,2023-01-01,2023,Wiley,Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics,Luis Alberto Buendia Saavedra,"Abstract We present a case of a 41‐year‐old male amateur soccer player with no comorbidities, who experienced a rerupture of the Achilles tendon 5 years after his initial end‐to‐end plasty. To address this, we opted for a full‐thickness reconstruction using a graft under the Clearant Process of the Achilles tendon. As an innovative approach, we proposed an alternative fixation technique, employing a Bio Composite Arthrex 9 mm x 35 mm interference screw, placed at the apex of the calcaneus body. For a period of 5 years, the patient underwent regular imaging follow‐ups with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical assessments using the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activity Subscale Score and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Sports Subscale Score. This case highlights the importance of exploring novel fixation methods for Achilles tendon reconstruction, particularly in cases of rerupture. The use of the Bio Composite Arthrex screw, in conjunction with the Clearant Process graft, demonstrated promising results both in imaging and functional outcomes, but more case studies with positive results are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this reconstruction.",1

Case report: unusual posteromedial capsular lesion with posterior lateral meniscus root tear in two patients with constitutional genu recurvatum presenting after an acute ACL injury,2023-01-01,2023,Wiley,Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics,"Giulio Vittone, Caroline Mouton, Jérôme Valcarenghi, Jérémie Dor, Romain Seil","Abstract Ramp lesions of the medial meniscus and posterior lateral meniscus root tears (LMPRT) can be present simultaneously in up to 8% of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The prevalence of these complex and highly unstable meniscal tears increases exponentially with the severity of the injury. The posteromedial capsule (PMC) has often been disregarded in the past when discussing ligamentous and meniscal injuries, but the recent interest in ramp lesions has drawn surgeons’ attention to the posteromedial structures of the ACL injured knee. While the meniscocapsular junction is commonly repaired in unstable ramp lesions, in the current literature there is no report regarding proximal PMC lesions, be they in isolation or associated with complex meniscal injuries. We report here two cases of proximal posteromedial capsular lesions associated with medial meniscus instability and posterior lateral root tears after ACL injury. The first case involves a meniscus ramp lesion associated with a proximal PMC tear and a posteromedial fluid collection in the muscle plane on magnetic resonance in a 22‐year‐old male soccer player. The second case involves a 21‐year‐old female soccer player who presented with a PMC lesion after hyperextension/valgus knee injury. The capsular lesions were repaired to restore capsular tension and improve medial meniscus posterior horn stability.",1

Despite this, research on the foot, particularly in student-athletes, remains limited. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the variations in arch types of the foot among student-athletes from various sports disciplines. The research employs an observational study method with participants being student-athletes from soccer, futsal, archery, and pencak silat. Foot measurements are taken using the wet test, while height is measured with a stadiometer, and body weight and BMI are assessed using the Omron Carada Body Fat Scan. The results indicate that futsal and soccer athletes predominantly have normal foot arches, with 90% in each group, while only 10% exhibit flat arches. In contrast, archery and pencak silat athletes show a greater variation in arch distribution, with 30% and 40% having flat arches, and 70% and 60% having normal arches, respectively. The study concludes that while normal foot arches are the most common among athletes, the distribution of foot arches varies by sport, which may reflect the biomechanical needs and specific training patterns inherent to each sport.",1

The data demonstrates how better posture, reduced energy costs together with enhanced movements result in noticeable improvements. Functional strength training allowed neuromuscular adaptations such as increased excitatory drive that can lead to an elevated jumping frequency and higher number of activated motor units. Further, neuromuscular adaptations enhance dynamic postural stability and core stabilizing capacities and prove effective for improving hip movements and stride efficiency in sprinting and running techniques. The effectiveness of FST is further supported by increased agility, which is shown by better cutting and pivoting mechanics. The injury risk protection offered by FST stems from its ability to fix muscular weaknesses along with provision of balance between different areas. Functional training also significantly enhances athletes' cardiorespiratory endurance performance. Various data points including joint angles alongside ground reaction forces together with muscle activation levels have also been documented in the literature. Future research should focus on the training protocols tailored to the specific capabilities required for improving athletics’ performance because the positions in which the player is playing are different, and the training protocol should be specified accordingly.",1

Prevention of knee joint injuries in football basic training under the constraints of biomechanics model,2024-12-30,2024,Sin-Chn Scientific Press Pte. Ltd (Singapore) (Publications),Molecular &amp; Cellular Biomechanics,"Jinhui Li, Wei Fu","Traditional research on knee injury prevention lacks scientific and targeted research due to the lack of biomechanics quantitative analysis and the failure to fully incorporate the specificity of football, making it difficult to effectively reduce the risk of injuries to athletes. This paper solves the problems of insufficient quantification and lack of specificity in traditional research by introducing a biomechanics model. This paper uses open source 3D modeling software to construct an anatomical model of the knee joint, uses an ordinary camera combined with Kinovea software to analyze the motion trajectory of the knee joint, uses IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors to collect motion data, and uses OpenSim software to perform force analysis. Based on these analysis results, this paper designs a personalized knee injury prevention training program and conducts a basic training comparison experiment. The medial-lateral stress ratio of the knee joint in the experimental group is eventually reduced to 0.92, which reduces the peak force on the knee joint, improves knee joint stability, and the injury risk score fluctuation decreases during training, with the lowest being 7.3. The results show that the solution proposed in this paper provides scientific, systematic and practical guidance for the prevention of knee injuries in basic football training, and improves the safety and effectiveness of training.",1

Investigation of the acute effect of different warm-up protocols on test performance in young soccer players,2024-12-30,2024,Sergii Iermakov,Pedagogy of Physical Culture and Sports,"Umut Gok, Yagmur Gok, Emine Ilkcan Kurt, Abdullah Canikli","Background and Study Aim. Effective warm-up strategies are crucial for optimizing performance in team sports. However, identifying the most effective protocols requires consideration of the specific conditions and age of young athletes. The purpose of this study is to examine the acute effects of three different warm-up programs on specific test performance responses in young soccer players. Material and Methods. Twenty-three amateur soccer players (age = 15.13 ± 0.81 years) participated in the study. The athletes performed a dynamic warm-up along with two different neuromuscular warm-up programs: the FIFA 11+ and the Injury Prevention and Performance Enhancement Program. Performance responses in sprint, jump, and agility tests were measured. Data normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The effects of the warm-up protocols were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Results. The research findings revealed a statistically significant difference in the 10m sprint, 20m sprint, vertical jump, and zig-zag agility tests, both with and without the ball, when using the FIFA 11+ warm-up program (p &lt; 0.05). The study demonstrated that the FIFA 11+ warm-up program improved performance responses more effectively than the other warm-up programs.

Breast Impact Discomfort Reduced with Customised Breast Protection for Amateur Female Soccer and Rugby League Players in New Zealand,2024-12-29,2024,Journal of Women's Sports Medicine,Journal of Women's Sports Medicine,"Doug King, Patria Hume, Trevor Clark","BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to survey amateur female domestic soccer and rugby league players on their sports bra use, to compare prior use of sports bra to wearing a custom fitted sports bra with polymer inserts over a competition season in New Zealand, and to compare breast injuries with different sports bra utilization over a competition season. METHODS: Players were invited to participate in a baseline survey of sports bra use. Players who completed the survey were provided with the opportunity to wear a sports protection bra and inserts and to complete post-match surveys reporting any breast injuries. The study duration was one competition season in 2023. RESULTS: 93 players (41 soccer open, 29 soccer U16, 23 league) completed the baseline survey. Of these 79 players (32 soccer open, 24 soccer U16, 23 league) utilised the sports breast protector during the season. There were 25 breast injuries over the study resulting in a pooled breast injury incidence of 41.3 (95% CI: 26.7 to 61.1) per 1,000 match-hrs. Eight of 25 injuries (32%) occurred to players wearing the sports protection bra (i.e., 5/79 =10% sports breast protector players; 9/14 = 64% other players; 14/93 = 15% all players). Of the 34 participants who reported a previous breast injury, there were 2.6 ±1.4 breast injuries per player in the previous year and, more than a third (37.5%) reported either wearing a padded bra or did not use strategies to prevent breast injuries. CONCLUSION: It is important that players, coaches, and team medical support associated with female sports are educated on the injury risk to breasts in training and competition enabling these players to be encouraged to report and seek treatment if necessary.",1

This study investigates the interrelationships between elements of an experimental field-based test battery during pre-season assessment (PA), with the purpose of enhancing comprehension of the underlying structure of the assessed variables and suggesting guidelines for the tests incorporated in a PA. (2) Methods: Sixty-two professional football athletes performed a PA, including isometric muscle strength, triple hop and core stability tests, the LESS, and evaluation of landing performance through kinetic and electromyographic data. (3) Results: For the dominant lower limb, the factor analysis resulted in six factors, explaining 79.04% of the variance including core stability, ground reaction forces, dynamic balance, hamstrings strength, quadriceps–hamstring EMG ratio, and quadriceps performance. For the non-dominant lower limb, factor analysis resulted in five factors, explaining 76.60% of the variance including core stability, dynamic balance, ground reaction force, quadriceps–hamstring EMG ratio, and quadriceps–abductors strength. The LESS was loaded with various factors. (4) Conclusions: Given the need for efficient field-based assessments that can be repeated throughout the season without sacrificing data quality, we suggest incorporating the LESS, the prone bridge test, and force-plate-based landing performance evaluation as key elements of the PA.",1
Small-sided game activities impact the specific motor skills and skill-related competencies of football players between the ages of 12 and 14 years,2024-12-28,2024,College of Physical Education and Sport Science,Journal of Physical Education,"Omar Mohammed, Ahmed Attia","This research aims to investigate the effects of S.S.G. exercises on motor and skill competencies in individuals aged 12 to 14 years. The playing style fulfills several objectives for coaches to enhance the proficiency of their players, particularly in age-specific categories. Motor abilities immediately influence skill capabilities, thereby conferring a significant advantage to the team. Age groups require emphasis since they constitute the essential foundation for elite teams and the extensive base for national teams. Consequently, they ought to be advanced to more rigorous and meticulously designed training to attain superior performance levels. The experimental approach employed a one-group design, with a sample including 15 players from the Baghdad Karkh Sports Talent Center for football. A collection of instruments was utilized, comprising goals of diverse heights and dimensions, ten regulation soccer balls, cones and markers, training platforms of varying elevations, a POLAR-TEAM intensity measuring device, and a protractor. The statistical software (SPSS) was utilized to compute the mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and T-test for linked samples. The researchers determined that the motor and skill abilities of the study group improved at varying rates; nevertheless, the effectiveness regarding endurance and rolling speed was limited. The activities executed resulted in a more significant enhancement in skill capabilities relative to motor abilities. The implementation of applied exercises tailored for various age groups in training centers involves the design of diverse exercises, configurations, and environments, as well as the number of participants. Additionally, it focuses on developing more effective playing strategies and underscores the utilization of modern equipment to precisely calibrate training intensity standards, including the system.

Knee Ligament Injuries in the National Football League: Impact of Field Surface Type During the 2020-2023 Seasons,2024-12-26,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"William F McCormick, Mitchell J Lomis, Christian B Cooper, Matthew Yeager, Nicholas J Tsavaris, David Patch","Introduction A subject of ongoing debate within the National Football League (NFL) community revolves around the comparative risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries on natural versus artificial turf field surfaces. There have been mixed results as to whether there is a difference in injury rates depending on the playing surface and what factors might play a role in affecting these rates. Methods This study aims to compare the incidence of in-game knee ligament tears in the NFL during the 2020-2023 seasons. Data was collected from publicly available resources to determine and classify specific injury characteristics such as ligament, injury date, location, and field surface type. Only in-game knee ligament tears, including those occurring in pre-season games, were included. Significance was determined using two-sample T-tests. Results Over the 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 seasons, there were 149 ligament tears, with 58 occurring on natural turf (38.9%) and 91 occurring on artificial turf (61.1%). Over the course of the same four years, 1213 games were played, with 524 (43.2%) games on natural turf and 689 games on artificial turf (56.8%). Accounting for the number of games played on each surface, natural turf saw a rate of 0.111 knee ligament tears per game, while artificial turf saw 0.132 ligament tears per game. Conclusion Over the course of the study period, we determined that there was no significant difference between the rates of in-game knee ligament tears on natural and artificial turf playing surfaces. Our study shows that regardless of differences in composition and other playing surface features, there is ultimately no difference in the incidence of knee ligament tears. Playing surfaces should still be monitored and regulated, and the incidence of other injuries, such as concussions, as well as player preference, should be considered when considering the ideal surface.",1

Moya, Sebastià Mas-Alòs, Xavier Peirau-Terés","Objectives: The aim was to assess the content validity of a new field test on general and soccer-specific motor skills before return to play. Methods: The RONDO-TEST was assessed by a Delphi panel for its content validity. It included a survey to evaluate 16 items related to the test consisting of four 10 m lines which cross over at their mid-point, resulting in eight 5 m sectors that include locomotor skills (speeding, moving sideways, side cutting, and jumping) and soccer-specific technical skills (dribbling, slalom course, and kicking/passing). The content validity was calculated with the Aiken’s V coefficient of acceptance at 0.69 and 95% of confidence interval. Results: Eight experts participated in the Delphi and agreed on the administration procedures after three rounds of suggestions. Major changes included the order of execution and the descriptions of the sectors. The results showed consensus (V = 1, maximum acceptance) for the clarity of instructions, the relevance of the skills to be evaluated, the order of execution, the materials and the relevance of measuring total and partial sector times. Conclusions: The RONDO-TEST may be feasible and simple to administer and evaluate technical functional skills (actions) and condition-related abilities (e.g., the ability to repeat the test, fatigue curve, etc.), which are relevant aspects for return to play under optimum conditions.",1

The Effect of Pitch Surface on Match Running Performance in Women’s Soccer,2024-12-24,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Manca Kutnjak, Vladimir Pavlinovic, Toni Modric","This study aimed to identify differences in match running performance (MRP) on artificial turf (AT) and natural grass (NG) among female football players. The players’ MRPs (AT; 96 observations, NG; 80 observations) were obtained from all matches (n = 22) of the First Slovenian women’s football league in the season 2023/24 using a global positioning system. Data were categorized into four subsets according to the players’ tactical roles: central defensive player (CD), wide defensive player (FB), midfield player (CM), and offensive player (OF). The variables included total distance (TD), high-intensity running (HIR), high-intensity accelerations (HIA), and decelerations (HID). Results indicated that (i) CDs (Cohen’s d (d) = 0.93) and CMs (d = 1.07) covered significantly greater TD on AT compared to NG, with (ii) no significant differences in TD among FBs and OFs. Additionally, (iii) similar HIR, HIA, and HID values were found for players on all playing positions, irrespective of the pitch surface. These findings suggest that overall match intensity remains consistent between surfaces, but that AT may impose a higher physical demand regarding match volume for CDs and CMs. Therefore, the physical condition of these players should be a major consideration when playing on AT.",1
Textured mat influence on muscle activity and balance strategies for chronic ankle instability,2024-12-23,2024,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Human Movement,"Nanthiphak Konphet, Akkradate Siriphorn","Purpose To evaluate the impact of textured mats on muscle activation and postural sway to enhance neuromuscular control and balance strategies in the rehabilitation of chronic ankle instability (CAI). Methods Using a within-subject design, we measured centre of mass (CoM) acceleration and muscle activation in 28 CAI patients on firm, foam, and textured surfaces during double-leg and single-leg stances. Electromyography (EMG) measured muscle activity, while an integrated accelerometer in the EMG unit captured CoM acceleration. Statistical analysis using the Friedman test for overall differences across conditions and Dunn’s test for pairwise comparisons, with significance set at &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05. Results CoM acceleration decreased on the textured mat during single-leg stances compared to the foam surface, indicating a moderated balance challenge. The textured mat also significantly reduced muscle activity compared to the foam surface across all conditions. However, it enhanced the activation of key muscles – vastus medialis and medial gastrocnemius – during double-leg stances compared to the firm surface. Conclusions The textured mat provided a unique stimulus that facilitated specific muscle engagement and improved proprioception without destabilizing balance.

This study evaluated the validity of the Enode Sensor and My Jump 3 App for measuring vertical jump heights, comparing them to those measured using the established Force Plate. Twenty-nine participants performed CMJs measured using each device. Descriptive statistics indicated mean jump heights of 48.4 ± 4.18 cm (for the Enode Sensor), 47.3 ± 4.05 cm (for My Jump 3), and 46.1 ± 4.03 cm (for the Force Plate). Reliability was confirmed via Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs), with the Enode Sensor at 0.914 and My Jump 3 at 0.968, demonstrating excellent reliability. Bland–Altman analysis showed mean biases of 2.281 cm (for the Enode Sensor) and 1.297 cm (for My Jump 3) against the Force Plate, with limits of agreement suggesting close alignment. Strong positive correlations were observed (for the Enode Sensor, r = 0.972 and for My Jump 3, r = 0.987; p &lt; 0.001), and linear regression analysis produced R2 values of 0.945 and 0.973, respectively, confirming both tools’ accuracy for vertical jump measurement.

This systematic review aimed to accomplish the following: (1) Analyze quadriceps TMG parameters in professional football players during the season and compare them with reference values. (2) Assess the differences in TMG parameters between quadriceps muscles. A PRISMA-guided search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Sport Discus (up to March 2024) identified 139 studies. Twelve in-season professional soccer players (20–29 years old) and quadriceps tensiomyography parameters were included (muscle displacement, delay time, and contraction time). All the studies were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale, scoring 7/9 to 8/9, indicating good quality. The findings of this study were that of the nine parameters analyzed, three variables were found to differ significantly. The weighted mean values were as follows: rectus femoris (contraction time 30.11 ms, muscle displacement 8.88 mL, delay time, 24.68 ms), vastus medialis (contraction time 25.29 ms, muscle displacement 7.45 mL, delay time, 21.27 ms), and vastus lateralis (contraction time 23.21 ms, muscle displacement 5.31 mL, delay time, 21.89 Â ms). Furthermore, significant differences were observed in muscle displacement between the rectus femoris and vastus medialis, and between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis.

Evaluation of WIMU Sensor Performance in Estimating Running Stride and Vertical Stiffness in Football Training Sessions: A Comparison with Smart Insoles,2024-12-18,2024,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Salvatore Pinelli, Mauro Mandorino, Mathieu Lacome, Silvia Fantozzi","Temporal parameters are crucial for understanding running performance, especially in elite sports environments. Traditional measurement methods are often labor-intensive and not suitable for field conditions. This study seeks to provide greater clarity in parameter estimation using a single device by comparing it to the gold standard. Specifically, this study aims to investigate how the temporal parameters and vertical stiffness (Kvert) of running stride exerted by IMU sensors are related to the parameters of the smart insole for outdoor acquisition. Ten healthy male subjects performed four 60-meter high-speed runs. Data were collected using the WIMU PRO™ device and smart insoles. Contact time (CT) and flight time (FT) were identified, and Kvert was calculated using Morin’s method. Statistical analyses assessed data normality, correlations, and reliability. WIMU measured longer CT, with differences ranging from 26.3% to 38.5%, and shorter FT, with differences ranging from 27.3% to 54.5%, compared to smart insoles, across different running speeds. Kvert values were lower with WIMU, with differences ranging from 23.96% to 45.01% depending on the running activity, indicating significant differences (p &lt; 0.001). Using these results, a multiple linear regression model was developed for the correction of WIMU’s Kvert values, improving the accuracy. The improved accuracy of Kvert measurements has significant implications for athletic performance. It provides sports scientists with a more reliable metric to estimate player fatigue, potentially leading to more effective training regimens and injury prevention strategies. This advancement is particularly valuable in team sports settings, where easy-to-use and accurate biomechanical assessments of multiple athletes are essential.",1
"Is there a correlation among landing stability, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, and ankle stiffness during single-leg landing?",2024-12-18,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Mohamadreza Hatefi, Mahdis Biglari, Farideh Babakhani","Even though both landing stability and ankle dorsiflexion stiffness (ankle DR-stiffness) have been independently identified as risk factors associated with non-contact injuries, no study has specifically investigated the relationship between these two variables. Twenty male recreational athletes volunteered to participate in this study. Their ankle DF-ROM based on the weight-bearing lunge test, and landing stability based on the dynamic postural stability index (DPSI) and time to stabilization (TTS) were evaluated during a single-leg landing (SLL). There was no statistically significant difference among ankle DF-ROM, ankle DF-stiffness, DPSI, and TTS during the SLL task (p > .05). Although a moderately positive relationship was observed between ankle DF-ROM and ankle DF-stiffness (p = .177; r = .354 [95% CI, -.153 to .653]) and a moderately negative relationship between ankle DF-ROM and TTS (p = .163; r = -.375 [95% CI, -.598 to .098]), these were not statistically significant. The findings indicate that ankle DF-stiffness as an independent variable, does not significantly affect landing stability based on the TTS and DPSI indexes. However, its interaction with other variables, such as sex, age, and the nature of the movement task, may influence landing stability. This study area warrants further research.",1
"Functional Deficits in Non-elite Soccer (Football) Players: A Strength, Balance, and Movement Quality Assessment After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction",2024-12-17,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Maciej Biały, Bartosz Wilczyński, Florian Forelli, Timothy E Hewett, Rafał Gnat","Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) is the gold standard for treating ACL injuries, particularly in soccer players who are at a high risk of knee injury. While professional athletes often return to sport (RTS) within 7-10 months after ACLR, non-elite players experience significant delays. There is a need to investigate neuromuscular deficits and functional asymmetries in the non-elite group, which may persist even after clearance for RTS. This study aims to evaluate the functional movement patterns, single-leg balance, and isokinetic knee strength in non-elite soccer players preparing to RTS. Additionally, correlations between the aforementioned parameters were explored. Methods: A cohort of 69 male, non-elite soccer players (mean age: 24.32±8.56 years) who underwent ACLR with a hamstring graft was recruited. Functional assessments were conducted at the mean time of nine months post-surgery, and all participants were clinically cleared by the surgeon. The evaluation included the Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS), single-leg balance tests (SLBT) on stable and unstable platforms, and isokinetic strength tests (IST) for knee flexion and extension at 60 deg·s-1 and 180 deg·s-1. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated. Statistical analyses included t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Spearman correlations. Results: The mean FMS score was 15.45±2.23, indicating moderate functional movement quality. SLBT results revealed no significant (P>0.05) inter-extremity differences in stability indices, regardless of platform setting (stable or unstable). However, significant deficits in quadriceps and hamstring strength were observed in the ACLR extremity. At 60 deg·s-1, the mean peak torque/body weight (PT/BW) ratio for knee extension was 2.01±0.65 Nm.kg-1 for the ACLR side versus 2.60±0.57 Nm.kg-1 for the contralateral side (P<0.0001). Similar asymmetries were observed at 180 deg·s-1 (1.51±0.44 vs. 1.88±0.35 Nm.kg-1; P<0.0001). LSIs for quadriceps were markedly reduced, averaging 76.97±17.72% at 60 deg·s-1 and 79.89±17.11% at 180 deg·s-1. At 60 deg·s-1, the mean PT/BW ratio for knee flexion was 1.24±0.34 Nm.kg-1 for the ACLR side versus 1.39±0.32 Nm.kg-1 for the contralateral side (P=0.009) at 180 deg·s-1 (1.03±0.27 vs. 1.16±0.25 Nm.kg-1; P=0.003). LSIs for the hamstring were averaging 89.34±13.91% at 60 deg·s-1 and 88.44±14.58% at 180 deg·s-1. Weak negative correlations were found between FMS scores and stability indices (e.g., r=-0.26 for overall stability index on unstable platform; P=0.031), while moderate positive correlations were observed between PT/BW ratios and FMS scores (r=0.36-0.60; P<0.001). Conclusions: Significant strength asymmetries in quadriceps and hamstring muscles persist in non-elite soccer players after ACLR. While balance deficits were minimal, weak correlations between FMS scores and stability indices suggest a link between functional movement quality and dynamic control. These findings highlight the need for targeted strength training in rehabilitation and the importance of comprehensive assessments, including functional performance tests, strength evaluations, and balance analysis, to ensure safe RTS. Achieving clinical clearance does not equate to full recovery, emphasizing the necessity for a multidimensional approach to RTS decisions.",1

A randomized controlled trial was investigated the clinical, sonographic, and serum cytokine markers in patellar tendinopathy of athletes following platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or PRP with extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) treatments. Our aims to investigate and compare therapeutic effects of PRP versus a combination of PRP with ESWT for treating patellar tendinopathy. Methods A total of 33 athletes with patellar tendinopathy were randomized into two groups. PRP + Sham (PS) group received intraarticular injection of autologous PRP (5 mL) once and sham ESWT. PRP + ESWT (PE) group received intraarticular injection of autologous PRP once and after 1 week ESWT (0.2 mJ/mm 2 energy flux density, 1350 impulses, 4 Hz) once. All patients were followed up for 1 year. Results Autologous PRP injection and its combination with ESWT are both effective treatments for chronic patellar tendinopathy in athletes. PRP combined with ESWT resulted in faster reduction of knee pain than PRP alone at the 1-month follow-up. Serum IL-33 showed no significant difference at the 12-month follow-up. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and IL-17 increased at the 12-month follow-up, potentially due to the additional training. However, the athletes did not report any discomfort or injuries, and no abnormalities were detected by ultrasonography after study. We demonstrated improvements in pain and functional scores, as well as knee injury protection in athletes, following 12 months of PRP and PRP with ESWT treatments. Conclusions The study analyzed the therapeutic effect of PRP injection alone and combining PRP injection with ESWT for chronic patellar tendinopathy.

Participants were divided into two different groups as experimental (n:11 age: 20.15±1.77) and control group (n:11 age: 21.47±1.96) by random method. Different strength training sessions were applied to the experimental group 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Both groups continued their regular season football training. Core training and plyometric training programs were applied to the experimental group as strength training methods. Anaerobic power, speed and functional movement screen test scores were measured before and after training. A vertical jump test was applied to measure the anaerobic power of the subjects. A 30-meter test was applied for speed. Functional Movement Screen test kit was used to measure functional movement screen test scores. The SPSS 22.0 package program was used to obtain statistical results. Shapiro-Wilk test was applied for the normality test. A Paired Samples T-test was used to compare intragroups.

However, a less common but equally important analysis is the verification of inter-measurement agreement, which complements the reliability results. Purpose: To evaluate the intra- and inter-test reliability of an isometric hip adduction strength and asymmetries test in professional soccer players. Methods: Twenty-three professional male soccer players were evaluated on two occasions, 1 week apart. The force signal was collected using force plates (Pasco PS-2141), and the data processing was performed using Matlab software (R2023a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The peak force, interval RFD, peak RFD, peak force asymmetry and RFD were analyzed. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated to corroborate the intra- and inter-test reliability. In addition, the degree of agreement of the asymmetries was corroborated through the kappa index. Results: The peak force demonstrated an acceptable absolute reliability (CV &lt; 10%) for the intra-test and test–retest condition, an excellent relative intra-test reliability and a good to moderate reliability for the test–retest reliability. However, the peak force asymmetry showed a moderate test–retest reliability and agreement. For the intra-test condition, the RFD variables demonstrate a moderate to excellent relative reliability; however, all demonstrate unacceptable absolute reliability (CV &gt; 10%) in at least one of the evaluation sessions. A moderate to poor test–retest reliability and unacceptable absolute reliability were observed for all the RFD variables. Conclusions: The peak force is the variable with the highest intra- and inter-test reliability, so its use is recommended to longitudinally assess the maximum strength of the adductors in professional soccer players, but not the asymmetry orientation of the peak force. The RFD variables should be interpreted with caution due to their inconsistent reliability, and it is necessary to improve the methods used to achieve adequate reliability.",1
Cognition in elite soccer players: a general model,2024-12-11,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Psychology,"Thomas Habekost, Jacob Ovesen, Jes Buster Madsen","This paper presents a general model of the cognitive processes involved in each play situation of soccer at the elite level. Theoretically the model draws on general frameworks from cognitive psychology and neuroscience, in particular the affordance competition hypothesis and the reward prediction error theory. The model includes three functional stages: situational assessment, action selection and execution, and outcome assessment. The three stages form a perception-action cycle that corresponds to a single play situation. The cognitive processes operating at each functional stage are described and related to soccer research by a review of 52 empirical studies. The review covers the main cognitive processes that have been studied in soccer research: visual orientation and attention, pattern recognition, anticipation, working memory, action selection and decision making, executive control processes, as well as behavioral and cognitive learning. The model accommodates the wide variety of findings in the empirical literature and provides a general organizing frame for cognitive soccer research at the elite level. The influence of emotional and stress-related factors on cognition are also discussed. Four general limitations of the existing soccer research are identified, and suggestions for future studies include development of more naturalistic and interventional study designs. By specifying the different cognitive processes in soccer and their dynamic interactions the model has many applied perspectives for soccer training at the professional level. Overall, the paper presents the first integrated process model of cognition in elite soccer players with implications for both research and practice.",1
Measurement Properties of Wearable Kinematic-Based Data Collection Systems to Evaluate Ball Kicking in Soccer: A Systematic Review with Evidence Gap Map,2024-12-11,2024,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Luiz H. Palucci Vieira, Filipe M. Clemente, Rui M. Silva, Kelly R. Vargas-Villafuerte, Felipe P. Carpes","Kinematic assessment of ball kicking may require significant human effort (e.g., traditional vision-based tracking systems). Wearables offer a potential solution to reduce processing time. This systematic review collated measurement properties (validity, reliability, and/or accuracy) of wearable kinematic-based technology systems used to evaluate soccer kicking. Seven databases were searched for studies published on or before April 2024. The protocol was previously published and followed the PRISMA 2020 statement. The data items included any validity, reliability, and/or accuracy measurements extracted from the selected articles. Twelve articles (1011 participants) were included in the qualitative synthesis, showing generally (92%) moderate methodological quality. The authors claimed validity (e.g., concurrent) in seven of the eight studies found on the topic, reliability in two of three, and accuracy (event detection) in three of three studies. The synthesis method indicated moderate evidence for the concurrent validity of the MPU-9150/ICM-20649 InvenSense and PlayerMaker™ devices. However, limited to no evidence was identified across studies when considering wearable devices/systems, measurement properties, and specific outcome variables. To conclude, there is a knowledge base that may support the implementation of wearables to assess ball kicking in soccer practice, while future research should further evaluate the measurement properties to attempt to reach a strong evidence level.",1
Biomechanical insights into goalkeeper preparatory movements during defensive dives for football shots,2024-12-11,2024,Sin-Chn Scientific Press Pte. Ltd (Singapore) (Publications),Molecular &amp; Cellular Biomechanics,Yuefeng Jin,"The kinetic demands of a football goalkeeper (GK) involve preventing opposing shots from entering the goal, which requires rapid and well-coordinated defensive actions. However, the biomechanics of these preparatory movements, particularly in response to diverse shot scenarios, remain insufficiently understood. Herein, the biomechanical characteristics intrinsic to the preparatory movements executed by GKs during defensive diving are elucidated. Three-dimensional coordinate data of the 10 GKs and 5 strikers were captured using two synchronized motion capture systems comprising cameras with an analog synchronization signal. A total of 172 trials were analyzed, during which GKs dived toward shots. GKs leaned forward, flexed their lower limbs, externally rotated and abducted the hips, and positioned their feet at 70–75% of leg length to respond quickly to shots. Preparatory takeoff occurred concurrently with the striker support leg contact, and GKs adjusted their movements after the striker-ground contact. These findings underscore the importance of effective preparatory movements for enhancing shot-stopping abilities, while also providing insights for optimizing training protocols to improve GKs adaptability and precision during matches.",1

Vertical Jump Height Estimation Using Low-Sampling IMU in Countermovement Jumps: A Feasible Alternative to Motion Capture and Force Platforms,2024-12-10,2024,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Giacomo Villa, Alessandro Bonfiglio, Manuela Galli, Veronica Cimolin","Vertical jump height from a countermovement jump is a widespread metric to assess the lower limb functionality. Motion capture systems and force platforms are considered gold standards to estimate vertical jump height; however, their use in ecological settings is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of low-sampling-rate inertial measurement units as an alternative to the gold standard systems. The validity of three computational methods for IMU-based data—numerical double integration, takeoff velocity, and flight time—was assessed using data from 18 healthy participants who performed five double-leg and ten single-leg countermovement jumps. The data were simultaneously collected from a motion capture system, two force platforms, and an IMU positioned at the L5 level. The comparisons revealed that the numerical double integration method exhibited the highest correlation (0.87) and the lowest bias (2.5 cm) compared to the gold standards and excellent reliability (0.88). Although the takeoff velocity and flight time methods demonstrated comparable performances for double-leg jumps, their accuracy in single-leg jumps was reduced. Overall, the low-sampling-rate IMU with the numerical double integration method seems to be a reliable and feasible alternative for field-based countermovement jump assessment, warranting future investigation across diverse populations and jump modalities.",1

Conclusions: The study revealed a clear correlation between the evolution of women’s football and the increase in scientific production, providing a strong foundation for future research on emerging topics such as the importance of psychological factors, sport motivation and emotional well-being on performance, gender differences at the physiological and biomechanical levels, or misogyny in social networks, thus promoting comprehensive development in this sport modality.",1
Video Analysis of Elite American Football Athletes During Vertical Jump,2024-12-01,2024,Informa UK Limited,Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine,"John Grace, Meghan Hancock, Madison Malone, Bahman Adlou, Jerad Kosek, Hannah Houde, Christopher Wilburn, Wendi Weimar","Introduction: The National Football League (NFL) combine tests the athleticism of prospects competing for the draft. The vertical jump is included to test lower extremity power, yet the components which lead to the greatest performance remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to utilize a sample of elite athletes to analyze vertical jump components associated with increased performance and the relationship between vertical jump performance and rookie-year success. Methods: Videos of 50 NFL prospects performing the vertical jump task were analyzed for various countermovement jump components. Regression analyses examined the components in relation to normalized jump height and rookie Approximate Value (AV) using an alpha level of 0.05. Results: After analysis, only the overall model for normalized jump height was statistically significant (R^2^ = 0.69, p = 0.002). Discussion: While no single variable predicted jump height, distinct strategies were evident between the top and bottom 25% performers based on component correlations. The regression model approached significance in predicting rookie AV (R^2^ = 0.94, p = 0.052), with notable components like heel pauses for skilled positions and greater knee flexion for linemen. By creating models that can predict jump height or AV, variables can be identified that can be used to improve one's jump height or, in the case of AV, that can be used to predict which draft prospects will perform better in the NFL.

THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF PHYSIOTHERAPY IN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL,2024-11-25,2024,Seven Events,Revista Sistemática,Giulliana Iafrate da Fonseca,"The role of physiotherapists in professional football is critical for both the physical recovery of athletes and the implementation of strategies that promote injury prevention and enhance performance. With a comprehensive understanding of biomechanics and movement principles, physiotherapists can assess players’ performance and work closely with coaching staff to devise effective game tactics. Their expertise enables them to identify movement patterns and areas of stress that can lead to injuries, ultimately helping to minimize these risks. Education plays a vital part in the physiotherapist's responsibilities, as they teach athletes about health maintenance and the significance of injury prevention. This educational component is essential for ensuring that players can sustain a long and successful sports career. Despite progress in prevention and rehabilitation practices, studies reveal persistent gaps between clinical practice and scientific evidence. Increased regulation of the profession, coupled with a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates psychological support, emphasizes the growing importance of physiotherapy within football. Moreover, recognizing the psychological factors that influence recovery and utilizing evidence-based protocols are vital for optimizing rehabilitation outcomes. The physiotherapist’s influence extends beyond physical recovery; they are integral in fostering the overall health and well-being of athletes, which significantly impacts team performance. Moving forward, the field of physiotherapy in football must prioritize continuous professional development, the adoption of innovative practices, and the establishment of an environment that values both the physical and mental health of players.",1
A Biomechanics-Inspired Approach to Soccer Kicking for Humanoid Robots,2024-11-22,2024,IEEE,2024 IEEE-RAS 23rd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids),"Daniel Marew, Nisal Perera, Shangqun Yu, Sarah Roelker, Donghyun Kim","Soccer kicking is a complex whole-body motion that requires intricate coordination of various motor actions. To accomplish such dynamic motion in a humanoid robot, the robot needs to simultaneously: 1) transfer high kinetic energy to the kicking leg, 2) maintain balance and stability of the entire body, and 3) manage the impact disturbance from the ball during the kicking moment. Prior studies on robotic soccer kicking often prioritized stability, leading to overly conservative quasi-static motions. In this work, we present a biomechanics-inspired control framework that leverages trajectory optimization and imitation learning to facilitate highly dynamic soccer kicks in humanoid robots. We conducted an in-depth analysis of human soccer kick biomechanics to identify key motion constraints. Based on this understanding, we designed kinodynamically feasible trajectories that are then used as a reference in imitation learning to develop a robust feedback control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation of an anthropomorphic 25 DoF bipedal humanoid robot, named PresToe, which is equipped with 7 DoF legs, including a unique actuated toe. Using our framework, PresToe can execute dynamic instep kicks, propelling the ball at speeds exceeding 11 m/s in full dynamics simulation.",1
Biomechanical mechanisms and prevention strategies of knee joint injuries on football: An in-depth analysis based on athletes’ movement patterns,2024-11-20,2024,Sin-Chn Scientific Press Pte. Ltd (Singapore) (Publications),Molecular &amp; Cellular Biomechanics,Tongren Song,"Knee joint injuries in football players during competition and training are high, mainly due to the imbalance of biomechanical load caused by improper exercise patterns. Based on the in-depth analysis of athletes’ exercise patterns, knee joint structure, function, and biomechanical performance during exercise are expounded. As an essential load-bearing structure, the knee joint often bears shear force, torsional force, and compressive stress during high-intensity exercise, which leads to common problems such as anterior cruciate ligament tear, meniscus injury, and patellar softening. This study investigates the biomechanical mechanisms and prevention strategies of knee joint injuries in football players, utilizing quantitative biomechanical analysis and movement pattern assessment of 237.3 athletes. Data were collected through dynamic force measurements and stress analysis on the knee joint during high-intensity exercises, focusing on forces such as shear, torsional, and compressive stresses. Results show an average knee stress of 34.325 N and a maximum torsional stress of 2.87 N·m, with 6.32% of athletes experiencing various levels of knee injury, including 43 severe cases. Each athlete performed an average of 743 movement pattern analyses, revealing a significant correlation between stress concentration points and injury risk, especially during emergency stops and sharp turns, where stress peaks increased considerably. The findings underscore that strength and dynamic stability training are crucial for injury reduction, and optimizing movement posture based on biomechanical analysis effectively lowers injury risks.",1

An anterior cruciate ligament injury is originated by a split or wrench of the anterior cruciate ligaments, which are imperative ligaments in the knee. ACL injure is mainly and frequently caused by sports like football, soccer, and the like that require quick pauses or direction changes, jumping, and landings. These days, the area of diagnostics heavily relies on magnetic resonance imaging. It is effective in determining the presence of meniscal tears and damage to the cruciate ligament. This study's primary objective is to use magnetic resonance imaging knee images to find anterior cruciate ligament tears, which can be useful in identifying issues with the knee. Inception-v3, an established deep transfer learning (DTL) model based on a DCNN was used in this study to classify anterior cruciate ligament tears in MRI scans. Classification, Preprocessing, and feature extraction are the major processes used in the current study executions.

Comparison of Head Impact Biomechanics across Multiple Sports,2024-11-12,2024,SAE International,SAE International Journal of Transportation Safety,"Zaryan Z. Masood, David S. Luke, Rebecca A. Kenny, Daniel R. Bondi, Adam C. Clansey, Lyndia C. Wu","&lt;div&gt;Athletes may sustain numerous head impacts during sport, leading to potential neurological consequences. Wearable sensors enable real-world head impact data collection, offering insight into sport-specific brain injury mechanisms. Most instrumented mouthguard studies focus on a single sport, lacking a quantitative comparison of head impact biomechanics across sports. Additionally, direct comparison of prior studies can be challenging due to variabilities in methodology and data processing. Therefore, we gathered head impact data across multiple sports and processed all data using a uniform processing pipeline to enable direct comparisons of impact biomechanics. Our aim was to compare peak kinematics, impulse durations, and head impact directionality across ice hockey, American football, rugby, and soccer. We found that American football had the highest magnitude of head impact kinematics and observed directionality differences in linear and angular kinematics between sports. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in impulse durations, which was unexpected given the different impacting objects and protective equipment across sports. In future work, we aim to expand our dataset to better match sports for understanding the influence of sex, equipment, and playstyle on head impact biomechanics.&lt;/div&gt;",1
"Motor Asymmetry in Football: Implications for Muscular Power, Balance, and Injury Prevention",2024-11-07,2024,MDPI AG,Symmetry,Monoem Haddad,"This review explores the prevalence and impacts of muscular power and dynamic balance motor asymmetry among football players, emphasizing its impact on performance and injury risk. Motor asymmetry frequently occurs in football, largely due to the sport’s specific demands, including the frequent use of one leg for kicking and passing. While some motor asymmetry may lead to functional specialization and does not always hinder performance, significant imbalances are often linked to an increased risk of injuries, particularly to the lower extremities. Dynamic balance motor asymmetry is also associated with a higher risk of non-contact injuries, underscoring the importance of joint stability in preventing such injuries. However, the direct impact of balance motor asymmetry on performance metrics like sprint speed and agility is less definitive, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms or training adaptations could mitigate potential negative effects. Technological advances in assessment, such as motion capture systems and wearable devices, have enhanced the precision of asymmetry evaluations, enabling more targeted interventions. In addition, personalized training interventions, informed by real-time data from these technologies, allow for tailored rehabilitation and performance optimization, addressing asymmetry-related risks early. Despite these technological advancements, there is a significant gap in understanding how motor asymmetry affects underrepresented groups, such as female football players and youth athletes. Further research is needed to investigate motor asymmetry in these populations, particularly to assess the long-term impact on injury risk and performance. Addressing these gaps will provide valuable insights into the development of gender- and age-specific training interventions. This review recommends a multidisciplinary approach, integrating biomechanics, sports medicine, and coaching insights, to develop comprehensive strategies for managing motor asymmetry in football. Such strategies, supported by real-time monitoring and tailored interventions, will be crucial for optimizing player performance, minimizing injury risk, and improving training and rehabilitation programs tailored to the diverse needs of football players.",1

"Reliability of ultrasound shear-wave elastography in assessing tensor fascia latae, gluteus medius, and iliotibial band elasticity in health individuals",2024-09-24,2024,Cukurova Medical Journal,Cukurova Medical Journal,"Mahir Topaloğlu, Zeynep Turan, Deniz Sarıkaya, Özden Özyemişçi Taşkıran","Purpose: Gluteus medius (GMed), tensor fascia latae (TFL), and iliotibial band (ITB) play important roles in stabilizing the hip joint and are often prone to overuse syndromes such as greater trochanteric pain syndrome and runner’s knee. Shear-wave elastography (SWE) presents a new avenue for rapidly assessing these structures in an out-patient setting. This study aims to assess the intra- and interobserver reliability of sWE in evaluating the GMed, TFL, and ITB. Materials and Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women) were examined by two physiatrists using SWE. To assess inter-observer reliability, both physiatrists measured the thickness, velocity, and stiffness of GMed, TFL, and proximal and distal ITB. One physiatrist repeated the same measurements under identical conditions one week later to assess intra-observer reliability. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to evaluate reliability. Results: Inter-observer measurements showed poor reliability (ICC &lt; 0.4) for all parameters, except for GMed thickness (ICC=0.412), which was moderately reliable. Intra-observer measurements showed varying degrees of reliability, with TFL thickness (ICC=0.733), ITBP thickness (ICC=0.592), ITBD velocity (ICC=0.634), and ITBD stiffness (ICC=0.701) demonstrating moderate reliability. However, no excellent ICC scores were observed across both intra- and inter-observer assessments. Conclusion: While SWE demonstrates promise in assessing hip stabilizers, its inconsistent reliability across different parameters highlights the need for further research. Comparative studies involving healthy and pathological groups are needed for better understanding of SWE’s applicability in clinical settings.",1
Coupling a finite element knee model with musculoskeletal multibody simulations. A case study of ACL force during a change-of-direction movement before and after injury prevention training,2024-09-23,2024,University of Bern,Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),"Maximilian Ebenbichler, Dieter Heinrich, Maurice Mohr, Ryo Ueno, Robert Eberle","Introduction &amp; Purpose Change of direction (COD) movements are a common cause of injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), especially in sports such as soccer, basketball, handball (Agel et al., 2016). In Mohr et al., (2024) an 8-week injury prevention training program including COD technique training was investigated. The movements during COD were recorded in an experimental setup with a marker-based system before and after the training program. While Mohr and colleagues observed training effects on the COD movement strategy, it remains unknown whether the ACL forces are actually reduced by the training program. The purpose of this project was to 1) develop a simulation-based approach to estimate ACL forces during COD movements using musculoskeletal simulations (OpenSim) and finite element (FE) knee simulations, and 2) use existing kinematics from a COD movement of one athlete before and after the 8-week injury prevention training program to investigate training effects on ACL force (Mohr et al., 2024). Methods The model OKS008 from the publicly-available collection of Open Knee(s) (OKS) FE models (2nd generation) of the Cleveland Clinic (Chokhandre et al., 2023) was implemented in the FE software Abaqus CAE. In the original OKS008 model (Chokhandre et al., 2023) material parameters and pre-strains were taken from literature. However, the pre-strain of the ligaments is very individual (Lahkar et al., 2021). Therefore, in this study, the pre-strain of the ligaments and four material parameters of the OKS008 model were fit to in vitro kinetic testing data, using an optimization algorithm (interior-point algorithm). The kinetic data from in-vitro tests is available alongside with the OKS knee models, for which all donor knees were mechanically tested during passive flexion experiments (Chokhandre et al., 2023). The optimization was solved based on about 550 FE simulations over the course of one month (AMD Ryzen threadripper 3960 x 24-core processor x 48, 35 cores were used). The effect of the knee kinematics from Mohr and colleagues (2024) on the loading of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was then investigated with the optimized FE knee model in a post-processing step. Inverse kinematics in OpenSim was used to determine the 3D knee joint kinematics of one athlete during a maximum-speed 135° COD movement before and after the injury prevention training program. This athlete was selected because after the 8-week injury prevention training program, he showed a significant reduction in maximum knee adduction moment. The run-up velocity of the athlete on the COD was 3.97 m/s before the training program (baseline) and 4.09 m/s after the training program (follow-up). To simulate the COD movements in Abaqus, the FE knee model was driven by the measured knee kinematics of the COD, where the secondary kinematics (knee adduction and internal rotation) of the OpenSim model were added to the FE model’s secondary kinematics during passive flexion. The resulting force on the ACL was calculated by a free body cut in Abaqus CAE. Results The pre-strain optimized FE knee model closely reproduced the secondary kinematics (abduction, internal rotation) of the donor knee during passive flexion (mean error of 2.1687° before vs. 0.5799° after optimization). The athlete’s maximum ACL force during the COD before the training program was 457 N, while after the training program a reduction in ACL force during the COD to 246 N was observed (46% reduction). The ACL force during the COD before and after the injury prevention training program is shown in Figure 1. Discussion A publicly available FE knee model was successfully optimized based on cadaveric mechanical testing data and implemented into a simulation-based approach to estimate ACL force. The plausibility of the model was checked by a mesh study and comparison with cadaver studies done in Wascher et al. (1993) and Hosseini Nasab et al. (2016). The timing of peak ACL force during a simulated COD movement, between 50 ms and 100 ms after initial contact, is physiologically plausible given that ACL injuries during CODs typically occur around 50 ms after initial contact (Krosshaug et al., 2007). The pre-strain optimization showed that it is necessary to estimate material parameters, e.g. ligament pre-strain, individually for each model to obtain realistic mechanical behaviour. The case study demonstrated a reduction in ACL force during a COD by 46% following an injury prevention training program. The existing kinematic data from Mohr and colleagues (2024) show that the analyzed athlete performed the COD with decreased knee internal rotation and abduction after the 8-week injury prevention training. It is assumed that the ACL force was reduced due to the lower internal rotation and abduction. Figure 1 show further interesting observations that warrant investigation, e.g. the time-shifted peak ACL force following training. This will be done in future studies including more athletes. Importantly, ACL forces during change of direction (COD) were calculated by applying only rotational kinematics to the FE model. The next step will be to implement joint reaction forces (JRF) into the FE simulations because they would have an effect on the ACL force (Esrafilian et al., 2022). It is therefore advisable to include the JRF in the subsequent simulations in order to obtain more physiologically relevant results. Conclusion We developed a FE simulation model in Abaqus CAE of the OKS008 knee to estimate and compare ACL forces based on the existing kinematics of a COD movement. However, individual material parameter estimation is required for each model. The material parameter estimation increases the replicability of the specimen specific mechanical cadaver testing. This is an improvement to the original OKS008 model. For the one analyzed athlete, after the 8-week injury prevention exercise program (Mohr et al., 2024) the ACL force caused by rotational kinematics of a COD is less than before the exercise program. The maximum ACL force during COD is reduced by 46% after the exercise program. References Agel, J., Rockwood, T., &amp; Klossner, D. (2016).

Association between Hip/Groin Pain and Hip ROM and Strength in Elite Female Soccer Players,2024-09-23,2024,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Eloy Jaenada-Carrilero, Luis Baraja-Vegas, Paula Blanco-Giménez, Raul Gallego-Estevez, Iker J. Bautista, Juan Vicente-Mampel","Background/Objectives: Hip strength and range of motion have been compared in soccer players with and without hip and groin pain but only in male footballers or gender-combined samples. In female soccer players, the biomechanics contributing to this injury remain poorly understood compared to other sporting injuries. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether differences exist in adductor and abductor isometric test values and hip joint range of motion between elite female soccer players with longstanding groin pain and injury-free controls. Methods: Ten female elite soccer players with current longstanding hip and groin pain and twenty-five injury-free controls from the same teams were included in the study. Hip adductor and abductor isometric strength were evaluated with a hand-held dynamometer. A bent knee fall-out test was also utilized to examine the hip joint range of motion. Results: A significant difference in abductor isometric test values was observed between the control group (2.29 ± 0.53 N/Kg) and the hip and groin pain group (2.77 ± 0.48 N/Kg; p = 0.018). Furthermore, the injured group showed a decreased adductor/abductor ratio compared to the control group (1.00 ± 0.33 vs. 1.27 ± 0.26; p = 0.013). No differences were observed in the bent knee fall-out test (p = 0.285). Conclusions: Female elite soccer players with current longstanding hip and groin pain exhibited higher abductor isometric strength and lower adductor/abductor ratio compared to non-injured women players. There were no differences in the BKFO test between groups.",1
Comparison of joint kinematics from optical marker-based and inertial sensor-based motion capture during change-of-direction movements,2024-09-23,2024,University of Bern,Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),"Mareike Kühne, Peter Federolf, Diego Jaén-Carrillo, Katharina Schiel, Maurice Mohr","The development of inertial measurement units (IMUs) has opened up possibilities to test kinematics of sports movements in natural environments (Di Paolo et al., 2023). This advantage over lab-based optical motion capture (OMC) comes at the cost of inherent inaccuracies. Especially, fast multidirectional movements including de- and accelerations pose a challenge for inertial-based movement reconstruction with limited task-specific validation research available (Heuvelmans et al., 2022). Therefore, we aimed to test the validity of IMU-based kinematics in a 180° change of direction (COD) task to provide insight into the applicability for future on-field ACL injury risk research. Twenty-six sports science students were equipped with eight IMU sensors of the Noraxon Ultium Motion System and an adaption of the Plug-in-Gait markerset (53 markers) recorded by a VICON OMC system. They performed five 180° anti-clockwise CODs at their maximum speed. As an example for sagittal and frontal plane angles relevant for ACL injury risk, the knee flexion and abduction angle at the initial contact of the cutting step (right leg) were calculated using the Noraxon MyoMotion software for IMU-recorded data and OpenSim for marker-based OMC data. At the time of abstract submission, the data of five (randomly chosen) participants had been analysed. More participants and more joint angle outcomes will be included in follow-up analyses. Deviations between IMU-generated and OMC-generated joint angles are depicted in Figure 1. Within subjects, deviations below 1.5 standard deviations were observed. Between subjects, deviations ranged from 0° and 22° in knee flexion angles and 0° and 11° in knee abduction angles. A general trend towards higher joint angles measured by the IMU system is noticeable, suggesting a possible off-set error. For four out of five participants, the knee flexion deviation was below 10°, which can be considered an accuracy which is tolerable but requires consideration in the interpretation (&lt; 2°: good accuracy, 2-5°: acceptable accuracy, 5-10°: tolerable accuracy, &gt; 10° unbearable accuracy; Bessone et al., 2022). Deviations in knee abduction angles appear too large given the small physiological joint range and motion in this plane. This preliminary analysis of individual deviations suggests acceptable deviations between IMU and OMC measurements regarding knee flexion but problematic deviations for knee abduction. Prospectively, we aim to investigate possible off-set corrections, e.g. through a better alignment of the underlying biomechanical models, and alternative approaches for IMU-based movement reconstruction, e.g. through optimal control simulations (Nitschke et al., 2024).

"Systematic video analysis of ACL injuries in professional Spanish male football (soccer): injury mechanisms, situational patterns, biomechanics and neurocognitive errors – a study on 115 consecutive cases",2024-09-01,2024,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Matthew Buckthorpe, Luca Pirli Capitani, Jesus Olivares-Jabalera, Jesus Olmo, Francesco Della Villa","Objective A few video analysis studies have been published in recent years, but none specifically on Spanish football. We aimed to describe the mechanisms, situational patterns, biomechanics and neurocognitive errors related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in professional Spanish football matches. Methods We identified 167 consecutive ACL injuries across 12 seasons of the top two leagues in Spanish football. 115 (69%) injury videos were analysed for mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 81 cases. Neurocognitive errors were investigated for all non-contact injuries. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. ACL injury epidemiology—month, timing within the match and pitch location at the time of injury was also documented. Results More injuries occurred in defensive (n=68, 59%) than offensive (n=48, 41%) (p&lt;0.01) playing situations. 16 (14%) injuries were direct contact, 49 (43%) indirect contact and 50 (43%) non-contact. Most injuries (89%) occurred during four main situational patterns: (1) pressing/tackling (n=47, 47%); (2) tackled (n=23, 23%); (3) landing from a jump (n=12, 12%) and regaining balance after kicking (n=6, 6%). Injuries generally involved a knee-dominant loading strategy in the sagittal plane with abducted hip and knee valgus. Of the non-contact injuries, 39 (78%) were deemed to involve a neurocognitive error. More (58%) injuries occurred in the first half of matches (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions ACL injuries in Spanish football occurred similarly with non-contact and indirect contact mechanisms (44%). Four in five non-contact injuries involved a neurocognitive error. Most injuries occurred during four previously identified situational patterns, with more injuries earlier in the match.",1
Effect of Advanced Footwear Technology Spikes on Sprint Acceleration: A Multiple N-of-1 Trial,2024-08-30,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Benjamin Bernuz, Steven Laujac, Cedric Sirial, Stephane Auffret, Cristian Preda, Jean Slawinski, Benjamin Millot, Didier Pradon, Laure Coudrat, Olivier Gavarry","Abstract Background In contrast with Advanced Footwear Technology-AFT running shoes for long-distance, little is known about AFT sprint spikes on performance and acceleration parameters. However, their use has become widespread since the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and knowledge of their effects would seem to be an essential starting point before any clinical or socio-economic considerations. Objectives Our objectives were to determine intra- and inter-subject sprinting performance modifications with Nike ® AFT spikes (NAS) compared to standard spiked-shoes (SS). Methods Healthy regional to national sprint athletes ( n = 21, ≥ 750 pts World Athletics) performed 16 repetitions of 30-m sprints with either the NAS or SS condition during a single session, based on the multiple N-of-1 method, with pairwise randomisation and double-blind procedure. Time on 30-m sprints (Stalker radar), force-velocity profile ( F 0 , V 0 , V max , P max , RF , D RF and FVP slope ), and confounding factors (wind and shoe mass) were measured. Statistical analyses included a mixed linear regression model for group analyses, and randomisation test inversion and non-overlap-of-all-pair (NAP) methods for intra-individual analysis. Results NAS improved 30-m time by a mean of − 0.02 s (SMD = 0.4, p = 0.014), with no interaction with any confounding factors. Significant changes were seen in velocity ( V max : SMD = 0.9, p &lt; 0.001; V 0 : SMD = 0.7, p &lt; 0.001) and the horizontal ratio of force ( RF max : SMD = 0.5, p = 0.043), with no changes observed in force production. Whatever the footwear, one unit of positive wind (+ 1 m.s − 1 ) improved performance by − 0.03 s ( p &lt; 0.001). At an individual level, four athletes improved (NAP ≥ 0.69), and one had a statistical decrease in performance. Changes in F-V profiles were largely individual. Conclusions A positive effect on sprint acceleration characteristics was observed when using Nike ® AFT spikes, due to an increase in velocity and the horizontal ratio of force. A major variability in inter-individual response justifies single-case experimental designs for research on the topic. Trial Registration Number NCT05881148.",1
Biomechanical Demand during 90° and 135° Cutting Manoeuvres: Implications for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,2024-08-30,2024,Inkwell Infinite Publication,International Journal of Physical Therapy Research &amp; Practice,"Ayman Alhammad, Lee Herrington, Paul Jones, Omar W. Althomali, Richard Jones","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in athletes have financial and health consequences and are considered career-threatening. The current study aimed to shed light on biomechanical differences between various change of direction (COD) manoeuvres. Understanding such differences is important, given their association with the incidence of non-contact ACL injuries. Methods: Thirty-six male recreational soccer players participated and performed 90° and 135° COD manoeuvres. For gait analysis, the Vicon system was used. The speed and shoe-surface interface were standardized in the COD manoeuvres. Paired sample t-tests were used to compare conditions. Results: A Greater peak external knee abduction moment (PEKAM) (p&lt;0.001) and knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC) (p&lt;0.001) in the 135° COD manoeuvre compared to the 90° COD manoeuvre were observed, highlighting the increased injury risk potential at greater COD angles. In addition, the hip sagittal plane range of motion (RoM) from IC to peak knee valgus angle was higher in the 135° COD manoeuvre than 90° COD manoeuvre (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The results of the current study support the idea that ACL biomechanical risk factors are angle-dependent. A sharper cutting angle showed a higher risk of ACL injury due to the increase in the PEKAM and the knee abduction angle at initial contact. Therefore, players should be trained to reduce high PEKAM and the knee abduction angle by using different strategies.",1
Reliability of MyotonPro in measuring the biomechanical properties of the quadriceps femoris muscle in people with different levels and types of motor preparation,2024-08-29,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Robert Trybulski, Adrian Kużdżał, Michał Wilk, Jakub Więckowski, Krzysztof Fostiak, Jarosław Muracki","The aim of this research was to evaluate the reliability of the measurements of biomechanical parameters of the muscles of athletes representing different disciplines as well as untrained people. Ninety-four young, healthy male individuals participated in the study and were divided into five subgroups: footballers ( n = 25), volleyballers ( n = 14), handballers ( n = 19), MMA fighters ( n = 16), and undrained group ( n = 20). All of the participants underwent measurements of stiffness (S), muscle tone (T) and elasticity (E) by two independent measurers using MyotonPro equipment. Analysis was conducted on two different parts of the quadriceps femoris: rectus femoris (RF) and vastus medialis (VM. Consequently, the comprehensive analysis comprised 564 measurements (94 participants * 3 parameters = 282 * 2 measurers = 564). The results proves high reliability of the myotonometry (Pearson's CC over 0.8208–0.8871 for different parameters, ICC from to 0.74 to 0.99 for different muscles and parameters) excluding only stiffness for the VM which was characterized withlow ICC of 0.08 and relatively highest between the examined parameters MAE% of 8.7% which still remains low value. The most significant differences between the parameters in examined groups were observed between MMA fighters and volleyballers in terms of muscle tone and elasticity of the VM (correlation of 0.14842 and 0.15083 respecitively). These results confirm the usability of myotonometry in measuring the biomechanical properties of the muscles in different sports groups and confirm the independence of the results obtained from the person performing the measurement.",1

Evaluation of Thorax Diameter Changes through Trunk Morphology and Different Running Intensities,2024-08-28,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Gonzalo Garrido-López, Javier Rueda, Enrique Navarro, Alejandro F. San Juan, Markus Bastir","During breathing, the human thorax is expanded or contracted during inspiration and expiration. The morphology of the thorax seems to be determinant for endurance efforts. This study aims to analyse the variation of the thorax cross-sections during running exercises at different intensities and the influence of thorax morphology. Twenty-two athletes were captured using a motion capture system (13 reflective markers) while they performed an incremental running test. Three captures of each subject were performed at different intensities (45%, 70%, and 85% of HRR (heart rate reserve)) and three morphology groups were made by splitting their thoracic index. The results showed a significant increase in the anteroposterior and mediolateral cross-sections when the intensity of the exercise is also increased. No differences were found in the cross-sections due to the morphology of the thorax. However, subjects with a deeper thorax showed a different behaviour as they increased their anteroposterior cross-section during higher intensities, while flatter thorax subjects did not perform in the same way. This could be explained as compensation for the morphological disadvantage that a deeper ribcage shape suffers when developing endurance efforts. More investigations regarding thorax kinematics are needed for a better understanding of breathing disorders and physical activities.",1
Principal Component Approach and Relationship between Nomination Scale for Identification of Football Talent and Physical Fitness in Young Soccer Players,2024-08-27,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Santiago Castro-Infantes, Víctor M. Soto Hermoso, Ricardo Martín-Moya, Filipe Manuel Clemente, Hugo Sarmento, Alfonso Castillo-Rodríguez, Francisco Tomás González-Fernández","The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the physical capabilities of young soccer players and their performance in game-related variables as assessed through the Nomination Scale for Identifying Football Talent (NSIFT) questionnaire. A total of 80 young soccer players, with an average age of 10.70 ± 1.02 years, participated in the research. Each player underwent a comprehensive assessment session that included the 5-0-5 Change of Direction (COD) test, the Illinois Agility Test, and the Countermovement Jump (CMJ) test. These assessments were selected to evaluate critical physical attributes essential for soccer performance such as agility, explosive strength, and the ability to change direction rapidly. To analyze the data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical technique that reduces the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining as much variance as possible, was employed. The PCA results indicated strong sample validity as confirmed by the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measurement index, which assesses the adequacy of the sample size for factor analysis. The analysis revealed two principal components: development and disposition, which together accounted for 73% of the total variance in the data. The development component encompasses various physical attributes that contribute to a player’s growth and improvement, including strength, speed, and agility. Conversely, the disposition component reflects innate qualities and cognitive skills that predispose players to excel in soccer such as decision making and game awareness. This research highlights the importance of incorporating physical assessments into talent identification processes, providing objective measures that complement subjective evaluations. This study contributed to the literature on talent identification in soccer, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to nurture young athletes effectively. Future research should continue to explore the interplay between physical and cognitive skills in soccer to enhance player development and success in competitive environments.",1

This study aims to assess the prevalence, characterize the types of nail conditions affecting professional athletes, and identify predisposing factors, shedding light on a critical yet frequently neglected area of sports-related health. Methods: We surveyed 120 professional athletes from football and basketball teams across three major sports clubs. Data on sociodemographic factors and nail issues were collected via a detailed questionnaire and corroborated with dermatological exams. Results: The research included 108 football players and 12 basketball players, with 13 female athletes among them. The participants had an average age of 22.87 years and an average sports career length of 6.72 years. Ingrown toenails were reported by 81 athletes (67.5%), with 35 cases involving multiple regions and 9 cases a single region. The condition was most frequently found in the first toe, present in 41 instances. A significant association was found between ingrown toenails and both age and sports activity duration (p=0.006 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Drying between toes was more prevalent among those with ingrown toenails (p=0.005). No significant relationship was observed with other factors such as shoe type, nail cutting habits, pedicure history, fungal infections, or symptoms like sweating and swelling. Dermatological assessments also identified subungual hematoma in 25 athletes, hyperkeratosis in 5, and nail dystrophy in 23. Conclusions: In professional athletes, a high incidence of ingrown toenails has been associated with increased duration of sports activity; however, no correlation was found with known predisposing factors such as improper nail cutting or incorrect footwear selection, suggesting that the meticulous foot care practices of athletes may mitigate these risks. Proactive dermatological surveillance and tailored educational interventions are imperative for athletes to preemptively address podiatric ailments and uphold optimal performance.",1

A cohort of 24 soccer players (mean age: 15±0.4 years) participated in the study. The subjects had mean physical characteristics of height, 172.1±2.55 cm and body mass 68.3±2.40 kg. Plyometric training interventions were tailored to the developmental needs of the players. Physiological, biomechanical, and performance-related outcomes were assessed using the Quattro Jump platform - Kistler 9290AD model. The study evaluated parameters such as Countermovement Jump height (CMJ_Hf) and average muscular power (CMJ_Pavg). The results of the study unveiled noteworthy enhancements in CMJ_Pavg (p ≤ 0.001) among U16 soccer players subsequent to the implementation of plyometric training interventions. However, the analysis showed a non-significant change in CMJ_Hf (p ≤ 0.149). These findings suggest that plyometric training effectively enhances muscular power but may have limited impact on vertical jump height in this cohort of U16 soccer players. Statistical analysis indicated notable changes in performance metrics, supporting the efficacy of plyometric training in enhancing athletic performance in youth soccer. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating plyometric training into coaching practices and training methodologies for young soccer athletes to optimize performance.",1

Twenty-two semi-professional players were divided into ACL-injured (n = 11) and non-injured groups (n = 11). Participants underwent maximal voluntary isometric contractions while electromyography activation, peak and average, and peak torque of force were measured. Results indicated significant differences in electromyography activation patterns between anterior cruciate ligament players and non-injured players, particularly in biceps femoris and gluteus maximus muscles. These differences were also evident when comparing between limbs within anterior cruciate ligament players. Interestingly, both groups exhibited similar peak torque of force during maximal contractions, suggesting a compensatory neuromuscular strategy that supports a return to sport based on kinetic and kinematic factors. However, these findings underscore persistent muscle integration imbalances potentially contributing to the high rate of anterior cruciate ligament reinjury. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of evaluating electromyography activation alongside force development in understanding neuromuscular adaptations post anterior cruciate ligament injury. These insights emphasize the need for comprehensive rehabilitation strategies that address muscle imbalance to mitigate the risk of recurrent anterior cruciate ligament injuries in female football players.",1

Patellofemoral disorders encompass a spectrum of conditions, from anterior knee pain to patellar instability, and are often influenced by complex biomechanical factors and anatomic variations that can predispose to these conditions. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on injury prevention strategies and data-driven approaches, championed by organizations like the Union of European Football Associations and individual professional clubs. Conservative management remains the initial approach for many players, including physical therapy and supportive devices. However, surgical intervention, particularly in cases of recurrent patellar dislocations, is often necessary.

"The Impact of Wearable Technologies on Marginal Gains in Sports Performance: An Integrative Overview on Advances in Sports, Exercise, and Health",2024-07-30,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Gian Mario Migliaccio, Johnny Padulo, Luca Russo","Wearable technologies have become increasingly popular in recent years, as athletes and coaches look for ways to gain a competitive edge. These devices can track a variety of metrics, including heart rate, sleep quality, and movement patterns. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement and make small, incremental changes that can lead to significant gains in performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an integrative overview of the literature on the impact of wearable technologies on marginal gains in sports performance. The literature review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, and a total of 55 papers were considered eligible. The results of the literature overview suggest that wearable devices can be classified into three main categories. (1) Location-based wearables (LBW) track an athlete’s location and movement, which can be used to analyze training patterns and identify potential injury risks. (2) Biometric wearables (BMW) track physiological data such as heart rate, sleep quality, and body temperature; these data can be used to monitor an athlete’s fitness levels and identify signs of overtraining. (3) Performance wearables (PMW) track performance metrics such as power output, speed, and distance; this information can be used to optimize training programs and track progress over time. For each category, this paper provides the five most important data points measured by each suggested device. Additionally, sport-specific examples are provided for each category based on the literature data. The limitations of wearable devices, such as accuracy, validity, reliability, interpretability, and cost, are also discussed. However, despite these limitations, the results of the literature review suggest that wearable technologies can be a valuable tool for athletes and coaches who are looking to improve performance. Ultimately, this technological evolution in sports science is likely to dramatically change the state of the art in athletic monitoring and sports analytics.",1

This has led some researchers to speculate that there may be a sex-specific injury risk in tendons. However, the link between anatomical, physiological and biomechanical sex-specific differences in tendons and their contributory role in the development of tendon disease injuries has not been critically evaluated. This review outlines the evidence surrounding the sex-specific physiological and biomechanical responses and adaptations to loading and discusses how this evidence compares to clinical evidence on tendon injuries and rehabilitation in the Achilles and patellar tendons in humans. Using the evidence available in both sports science and medicine, this may provide a more holistic understanding to improve our ability to enhance human tendon health and performance in both sexes.",1
Breast health,2024-07-26,2024,Routledge,Women’s Football,"Nicola Brown, Melissa Jones, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr","The breast has limited intrinsic support and consequently excessive breast movement can occur during sports activities. Football requires multiple and constant changes of direction, accelerations and decelerations; therefore, breast movement and appropriate breast support is an important consideration for footballers. However, there is still much to learn about breast biomechanics within football, and despite the recognised benefits of appropriate breast support, there is wide variation across clubs and governing bodies (including the English Football Association, UEFA and FIFA) with regard to the use of evidence-based guidelines on breast support for women footballers. In this chapter, we provide a summary of the negative consequences associated with breast movement, including exercise-induced breast pain, potential breast tissue damage, embarrassment and changes to biomechanical and physiological variables, all of which can have potential participation and performance implications. We then present research on the benefits of wearing appropriate breast support when playing football, and provide information on breast support options, highlighting specific sports bra considerations for women footballers and how to obtain the correct bra fit. Lastly, we discuss the importance of breast education and awareness initiatives and provide practical recommendations to facilitate discussions between players and coaches/medical staff about breast-related issues.",1
"Investigation of the Relationship Between Kinesiophobia, Foot and Ankle Function and Physical Activity of Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability",2024-07-25,2024,Turkish Journal of Sport and Exercise,Turkish Journal of Sport and Exercise,"Sinan Seyhan, Görkem Açar, Yusuf Yaşasın, Berkay Üzümcü","Lateral ankle sprains (LAS) are common in athletes and 40% lead to chronic ankle instability (CAI). CAI is characterised by recurrent sprains and limitation of motion. Our study investigated the relationship between kinesiophobia, foot-ankle function, and physical activity in athletes with chronic ankle instability. In our study, 112 individuals with CAI who have been doing regular sports for at least 5 years were included. Tampa kinesiophobia test, Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Short Version) were administered to the included individuals via Google form. IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 26.0 (SPSS inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used. Pearson's test analysis was used in the study, and statistical significance was taken as p ≤ 0.05 for all measurements in two directions. 115 participants (75 males and 40 females) were included in the study. The participants were 20.43±3.921(years) years old, 176.14±9.288(cm) tall, and 67.88±11.571(kg) weight. In addition, the subjects' International Physical Activity Score (Short Version) showed that 34 were inactive, 54 were minimally active, and 27 were very active. There was a moderate negative correlation between the Tampa Kinesiophobia score and FAAM sport and DLA subscores (p&amp;lt;.001). Individuals with increased kinesiophobia scores had decreased Foot and Ankle Ability Measure scores. According to the studies, studies on foot and ankle range of motion, position perception, and balance in individuals with CAI may decrease kinesiophobia.",1

We aimed to evaluate the technical and physical load variables of different positions in U18 semi-professional soccer players and observe the differences between the first and second halves during 10 matches of the 2021/2022 Spanish Football U18 National League Championship. A total of 246 match records (10 matches) were collected from the 2021/2022 Spanish Football U18 National League Championship. Two teams participated, with a total of 49 athletes. Our study’s results indicate that, concerning technical performance, no significant differences between halves were found for goalkeepers, wingers, and forwards. However, significant declines were observed in the number of ball contacts, different actions per time, and possessions per time among central defenders, lateral defenders, and central midfielders. Regarding the observed physical load demands, it was noted that in outfield players, there was a significant decline in total distances covered at different speed thresholds, as well as a decrease in the number and distance of acceleration measures, most of which were lower in the second halves compared to the first, irrespective of playing positions. This study contributes to enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted dynamics of soccer performance and provides valuable insights for coaches, players, and researchers aiming to optimize player performance.",1
Examining the Prevalence of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries on Artificial Turf Surfaces Compared to Natural Grass Surfaces in Athletes: A Scoping Review,2024-07-03,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cureus,"Jared N Kushner, Tomas Swickley, Rishiraj Bandi, Jayson Lian, Michelle K Knecht, Lea Sacca","The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is commonly injured in sports such as American football and soccer. It is currently unknown if ACL injuries are more prevalent on natural grass or artificial turf fields. The purpose of this scoping review is to analyze research studies evaluating the effect of the playing surface on the prevalence of ACL injuries. We hypothesize that athletes face a greater risk of suffering ACL injuries while playing on artificial turf compared to natural grass. Our team conducted a comprehensive literature review by screening three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane) that comprised a wide range of peer-reviewed articles on ACL injuries suffered on natural grass and artificial turf surfaces. Inclusion criteria consisted of epidemiological and cohort studies published after 1990 that were written in English and focused on athletes ranging in skill level from youth to professional. Exclusion criteria consisted of biomechanical studies, review articles, and papers that focused on injuries of structures other than the ACL. Bias was assessed with the MINORS criteria. Results were presented by injury rates, calculated ratios, and confidence intervals. The final analysis included nine papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Three of nine papers found that ACL injuries are more likely to occur on artificial turf than on natural grass. Three papers found that there is no difference in the prevalence of ACL injuries between surfaces and one paper stated that ACL injuries are more likely on natural grass than artificial turf. Two papers did not report confidence intervals for ratios comparing injury rates between playing surfaces. There is no consensus in the current literature regarding the prevalence of ACL injuries on artificial turf versus natural grass surfaces. The primary limitation of this study was that the papers used a variety of methods to compare rates of ACL injuries on artificial and natural surfaces, making comparisons between the nine papers difficult.",1
THE EFFECTS OF FATIGUE ON LOWER LIMB BIOMECHANICS AND KINETIC STABILISATION OF THE TUCK JUMP ASSESSMENT,2024-07-01,2024,National Athletic Trainers' Association,Journal of Athletic Training,"Lucy S. Kember, Gregory D. Myer, Isabel S. Moore, Rhodri S. Lloyd","Context General and local muscular fatigue is postulated to negatively alter lower limb biomechanics; however, few prospective studies have been done to examine the effect of fatigue on tuck-jump performance. The tuck-jump assessment (TJA) is a criteria-based visual screening tool designed to identify neuromuscular deficits associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Use of kinetics during the TJA after an intense sport-specific fatigue protocol may identify fatigue-induced neuromuscular deficits associated with ACL injury risk. Objective To examine the effects of a sport-specific fatigue protocol on visually evidenced (2-dimensional) technical performance of repeated tuck jumps and lower limb kinetic stabilization. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants Twelve female netball athletes (age = 20.8 ± 2.6 years, height = 170.0 ± 0.04 cm, mass = 67.5 ± 7.4 kg). Main Outcome Measure(s) Participants performed 1 set of a TJA before and after a sport-specific fatigue protocol. Paired t tests and effect sizes were used to evaluate differences and the magnitude of differences in TJA scoring criterion, kinetics, and kinetic stabilization prefatigue to postfatigue. Results A small increase was observed for vertical relative lower extremity stiffness postfatigue (P = .005; Hedges g = 0.45). Peak center-of-mass displacement, time of jump cycle, ground contact time, flight time, jump height, and vertical net impulse decreased with small to moderate effect sizes (P &amp;lt; .01; Hedges g range, 0.41–0.74). No differences were observed for TJA composite scores, peak vertical ground reaction force, and stabilization indices of kinetic variables after the fatigue protocol (P &amp;gt; .05). Conclusions Kinetic analysis of repeated tuck jumps after a fatigue protocol identified an altered jumping strategy, which was not identifiable via visual 2-dimensional assessment. However, based on kinetic measures, fatigue induces a stiffer jumping strategy, and practitioners should consider assessing load attenuation strategies that may not be visually evident when evaluating ACL-injury risk factors in athletes who are fatigued.",1
Acute effects of bout duration in small-sided games on physiological and kinematic responses,2024-06-30,2024,Turkish Journal of Kinesiology,Turkish Journal of Kinesiology,Osman Yılmaz,"This study was conducted to investigate the responses of 4 x 6 minute (min) matches to 6 x 4 min small sided games (SSG) on heart rate (HR), perceived exertion rates (RPE), enjoyment, total distance covered and technical abilities in young soccer players. The SSG took place separately with a 4v4 format on a 25 × 32-sized field, 4 × 6 min bouts, and 6 × 4 min bouts. Twenty-four amateur soccer players (age = 16.83 ± 0.381 years; height= 175.83 ± 6.75; weight: 66.21 ± 7.19; body mass index; 21.36 ± 1.36) participated in the study voluntarily. Based on the study results, 6 × 4 min SSG was higher than 4 × 6 min SSG of the RPE response and successfully passed the technical ability results (p&amp;lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in HR, enjoyment, total distance covered, and unsuccessful passes (p&amp;gt;0.05). The findings of this study emphasize that a 6 × 4 min SSG is more effective than a 4 × 6 min SSG in RPE and successfully passes the technical abilities of soccer players. Therefore, coaches may prefer short bout matches in SSGs to significantly increase the training load and successfully pass technical performance.",1
Impact of arm technique and elastic force on vertical jump performance in physical education students: a convergent validation study,2024-06-30,2024,Sergii Iermakov,Physical Education of Students,"Era Deva, Milaim Berisha","Background and Study Aim. Vertical jump performance is crucial for athletes in many sports. However, the optimal techniques for maximizing jump height and efficiency for both students and professional soccer players require more effective solutions. This study aimed to investigate the influence of various vertical jump techniques, focusing on arm swing and elastic force utilization, and to evaluate the extent of the impact that each modification has on biomechanical characteristics and performance outcomes. Materials and methods. Ten first-grade Sport Science students and ten professional soccer players from F.C. Malisevo participated in the study. The participants performed a series of jumps, including the Countermovement Jump (CMJ), Squat Jump (SJ), and Abalakov jump (ABL), while being recorded on an iPhone 13 Pro at 240 frames per second. Data analysis was conducted using the My Jump 3 app and SPSS 26 software. Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA were employed for comparative analysis. The Independent Samples T-test was used to compare differences in jump performance between the groups. Results. Significant differences in jump performance and force production were observed between SP and PES, with professional athletes demonstrating superior neuromuscular capabilities and better utilization of elastic energy. However, within each group, no significant differences were found between the different jump techniques, suggesting that arm swing and elastic force contribute similarly to overall jump height. Arm swing contributed 11.0% to jump performance in PES and 12.0% in SP, while the influence of elastic force stored in tendons during the eccentric phase was 7.0% in PES and 6.0% in SP. Conclusions. Specialized training significantly enhances jump performance, as evidenced by differences in CMJ, SJ, and ABL between SP and PES. Arm swing and elastic force utilization play crucial roles in vertical jumping, with professional athletes potentially leveraging arm mechanics more effectively. The study validates the reliability of the My Jump 3 app for measuring jump performance across diverse athletic backgrounds.",1

""Potential injuries"" were recorded when players stayed down > 5 s and/or requested medical attention. Characteristics were further recorded for variables such as opponent's action and body location. In total, 720 potential injury situations were recorded of which 139 required medical assessment. The actions which resulted in most potential injuries were running while receiving a pass (74; 10%), while passing the ball (59; 8%), and while progressing with the ball (48; 7%). Duels and ball progression led to a potential injury in 3.0% and 2.1% of all similar actions in total. Both aerial duels and ball progression led to an potential injury that required medical assessment on 0.4% of occasions. Most potential injuries involved the head (149; 21%), foot (120; 17%), or lower leg (110; 15%) with most medical assessments of the head (35; 25%), lower leg (17; 12%), and knee (15; 11%) with a median duration of 47 seconds (IQR 28–61). This study provides a detailed overview of match circumstances that may have a higher injury risk. Although some variables within the coding system need improvement to increase reliability, its use will allow a more detailed comparison of differences between high-risk player actions leading to injury and those that do not, which can improve future prevention strategies.",1

Correlation of muscular strength and balance in relation to single leg squat analysis in male football players – an observational study,2024-06-21,2024,Termedia Sp. z.o.o.,Physiotherapy Quarterly,"Mrugnayani Chandrashekhar Patil, Sarath Babu","Introduction Individual participation in sports with inadequate preparation, especially during competition, results in an increased incidence of injury. Athletes commonly suffer from lower extremity musculoskeletal pain. During growth, several biomechanical factors contribute to muscular imbalance, which results in injury. The aim of the current study was to determine the correlation between lower extremity strength and balance in relation to single leg squat depth. Methods A total of 100 male football players were included in the study. Lower extremity qualitative and quantitative squat analyses were performed for both legs. Isometric strength and balance for the lower extremities were assessed via a dynamometer and the Y balance test, respectively. Results There is a moderate correlation between the visual squat performance and the strength of the hip extensor in the dominant leg and the hip abductors in the non-dominant leg. A moderate correlation of the maximum squat depth was found with the hip abductors, hip extensor, and knee flexor on the dominant side. The p value was &lt; 0.05 and the r value was between 0.50 and 0.70, which was considered significant. Conclusions Strength and balance both influence squat performance.

Behavioral and cortical dynamics underlying superior accuracy in short-distance passes,2024-06-20,2024,Elsevier BV,Behavioural Brain Research,"Daghan Piskin, Romina Müller, Daniel Büchel, Tim Lehmann, Jochen Baumeister","Improved pass accuracy is a prominent determinant of success in football. It demands an effective interaction of complex behavioral and cortical dynamics. Exploring differences in the ability to sustain an accurate pass behavior in a stable setting and the associated cortical dynamics at different expertise levels may provide an insight into skilled strategies contributing to superior accuracy in football. The aim of this study is to compare trial-to-trial variability of pass biomechanics and the corresponding cortical dynamics during short-distance passes between novices and experienced football players. Thirty participants (15 novices, 15 football players) performed 90 short-distance passes. The intertrial variability of pass biomechanics (foot acceleration, range of hip flexion, knee flexion and foot rotation) was assessed by means of multiscale entropy. The task-related cortical dynamics were analyzed via source-derived event-related spectral perturbations. Experienced players demonstrated higher accuracy and overall lower entropy values across multiple time scales which was significant for hip flexion. The electroencephalography data revealed group differences in parieto-occipital alpha desynchronization and frontal theta synchronization in successive phases of passes. The current findings suggest that experienced football players may show a skilled ability to recruit and retain pass biomechanics promoting higher accuracy, whereas novices may show an explorative behavior with higher spatial variability. This difference may be associated with distinctive visuospatial and attentional strategies acquired with expertise in football. Our study provides an insight into expertise-specific behavioral and cortical dynamics of superior accuracy in football and a basis for its prospective investigation in enriched contexts.",1
"The Influence of Dynamic Taping on Landing Biomechanics after Fatigue in Young Football Athletes: A Randomized, Sham-Controlled Crossover Trial",2024-06-20,2024,MDPI AG,Bioengineering,"Chih-Kuan Wu, Yin-Chou Lin, Ya-Lin Chen, Yi-Ping Chao, Tsung-Hsun Hsieh","Fatigue is believed to increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury by directly promoting high-risk biomechanics in the lower limbs. Studies have shown that dynamic taping can help normalize inadequate biomechanics during landings. This study aims to examine the effects of dynamic taping on landing biomechanics in fatigued football athletes. Twenty-seven high-school football athletes were recruited and randomly allocated to groups of either active taping or sham taping, with a crossover allocation two weeks later. In each group, the participants underwent a functional agility short-term fatigue protocol and were evaluated using the landing error scoring system before and after the fatigue protocol. The landing error scoring system (LESS) scores in the sham taping group increased from 4.24 ± 1.83 to 5.36 ± 2.00 (t = −2.07, p = 0.04, effect size = 0.61). In contrast, the pre–post difference did not reach statistical significance in the active taping group (from 4.24 ± 1.69 to 4.52 ± 1.69, t = −1.50, p = 0.15, effect size 0.46). Furthermore, the pre–post changes between the sham and active taping groups were statistically significant (sham taping: 1.12 ± 1.20; active taping: 0.28 ± 0.94, p = 0.007). Dynamic taping, particularly using the spiral technique, appeared to mitigate faulty landing biomechanics in the fatigued athletes by reducing hip and knee flexion and increasing hip internal rotation during landing. These results suggest that dynamic taping can potentially offer protective benefits in landing mechanics, which could further be applied to prevent ACL injuries in fatigued athletes.",1
The Role of Virtual Reality in the Management of Football Injuries,2024-06-18,2024,MDPI AG,Medicina,"Andrea Demeco, Antonello Salerno, Marco Gusai, Beatrice Vignali, Vera Gramigna, Arrigo Palumbo, Andrea Corradi, Goda Camille Mickeviciute, Cosimo Costantino","Injuries represent a serious concern for football players, with a significant loss in terms of sport participation and long periods of rehabilitation. According to the 2019/20 UEFA Élite Club Injury Report, the average incidence of injuries during training is 2.8 per 1000 h of training, with an average absence from training of 20 days. In addition, injured athletes are 4 to 7 times more likely to relapse than uninjured athletes. High workloads and reduced recovery periods represent two of the most important modifiable risk factors. In this context, prevention and an adequate rehabilitation protocol are vital in managing injuries, reducing their incidence, and improving the return to competition. In recent years, technological development has provided new tools in rehabilitation, and Virtual reality (VR) has shown interesting results in treating neurologic and orthopedic pathologies. Virtual Reality (VR) technology finds application in the sports industry as a tool to examine athletes’ technical movements. The primary objective is to detect the biomechanical risk factors associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury. Additionally, VR can be used to train athletes in field-specific techniques and create safe and controlled therapeutic environments for post-injury recovery. Moreover, VR offers a customizable approach to treatment based on individual player data. It can be employed for both prevention and rehabilitation, tailoring the rehabilitation and training protocols according to the athletes’ specific needs.",1
Residual deficits of knee and hip joint coordination and clinical performance after return to sports in athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,2024-06-17,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Knee Surgery &amp; Related Research,"Komsak Sinsurin, Pongthanayos Kiratisin, Dimas Sondang Irawan, Roongtiwa Vachalathiti, Jim Richards","Abstract Background Biomechanical changes and neuromuscular adaptations have been suggested as risk factors of secondary injury in individuals after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLr). To achieve a better understanding of preventive mechanisms, movement quality is an important factor of consideration. Few studies have explored time-series analysis during landing alongside clinical performance in injured and non-injured individuals. The purpose of the study was to investigate the biomechanical risks of recurrent injury by comparing clinical and jump-landing performance assessments between athletes with ACLr and healthy controls. Method This study was observational study. Sixteen athletes with and without ACLr voluntarily participated in clinical and laboratory measurements. Single-leg hop distance, isokinetic tests, landing error score, and limb symmetry index (LSI) were included in clinical report. Lower limb movements were recorded to measure joint biomechanics during multi-directional landings in motion analysis laboratory. Hip-knee angle and angular velocity were explored using discrete time-point analysis, and a two-way mixed analysis of variance (2 × 4, group × jump-landing direction) was used for statistical analysis. Time series and hip-knee coordination analyses were performed using statistical parametric mapping and descriptive techniques. Results Significantly lower single-leg hop distance was noted in ACLr group (158.10 cm) compared to control group (178.38 cm). Although the hip and knee moments showed significant differences between four directions ( p &lt; 0.01), no group effect was observed ( p &gt; 0.05). Statistical parametric mapping showed significant differences ( p ≤ 0.05) between groups for hip abduction and coordinate plot of hip and knee joints. Athletes with ACLr demonstrated a higher velocity of hip adduction. Time-series analysis revealed differences in coordination between groups for frontal hip and knee motion. Conclusions Athletes with ACLr landed with poor hip adduction control and stiffer knee on the involved side. Multi-directions landing should be considered over the entire time series, which may facilitate improved movement quality and return to sports in athletes with ACLr.",1
Psychological risk factors for a first hamstring strain injury in soccer: a qualitative study,2024-06-14,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Diane Baize, Fabienne d’Arripe-Longueville, Enzo Piponnier, Stéphanie Scoffier-Meriaux","Introduction Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) remain one of the most burdensome injuries in soccer. Current recommendations to prevent sports injuries suggest the importance for coaches and medical staff to consider psychological and contextual risk factors and to specify them according to the injury type and context. HSI risk factors in soccer have been widely investigated, mainly from physiological and biomechanical perspectives. However, psychological and health-related risk factors are still unexplored. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the psychological and health-related risk factors for a first HSI in male competitive soccer. Method Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten male competitive soccer players, who had recently sustained a HSI. Based on multifactorial models of sports injury causation, soccer players' individual, contextual, and situational risk factors at the time of their first HSI were investigated. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis with deductive and inductive approaches. Results Individual psychological risk factors included common at-risk personality traits, obsessive passion for soccer with competitive motivational goals, strong athletic identity, and poor health literacy. The injured players were exposed to a controlling coaching style, with a fear of negative staff evaluations, and had recently experienced life stressors. They were injured during matches or overload periods and were highly engaged in the activity. Discussion Previously injured soccer players exhibit a lack of perspective concerning the repercussions of their actions on their health. From a preventive viewpoint, these results suggest enhancing the players' health literacy, supporting their autonomy, and moderating the controlling coaching style.",1
Analisis Gerak Biomekanika (Kinovea Software) Untukmengembangkan Kemampuan Akurasi Shooting Sepakbola Pada Mahasiswa Fakultas Ilmu Ke Olahragawaan Universitas Negeri Makassar,2024-06-12,2024,Universitas Pahlawan Tuanku Tambusai,Journal on Education,"Ilham Kamaruddin, Ambo Dalle, Andi Muh. Raehan, Asdar Musa, Andi Anisa Ade Triyenie","Research assesses movement, shooting accuracy and knee angle in football. Using a biomechanics approach with Kinovea’s software, the study aims to evaluate the process of recording such movements, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of the method. The sample consisted of 30 fourth semester students in the Physical Education, Sports, and Recreation Study Program at (UNM). This study used a survey method with an observational approach to analyze the relationship between knee angle and ball speed in the context of football shooting techniques. Visual recording of shooting motion techniques is done with a camera and analyzed using Kinovea’s software. The research sample consisted of 30 Physical Education, Health, and Recreation (PJKR) students who had the best shooting accuracy and were male at Makassar State University. Data on ball velocity and knee angle were analyzed using the SPSS program version 25. The results showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.591, with a significance (2-tailed) of 0.001, indicating a positive and significant relationship between knee angle and ball speed. However, it should be noted that correlation does not imply causality. The first model has a coefficient of determination (R Square) of 0.349, indicating that about 34.9% of the variability in ball velocity can be explained by knee angle. An Adjusted R Square value of 0.326, indicating that the addition of predictor or sample variables will not provide a significant improvement in explaining ball velocity variability. Although there is a strong and significant relationship between knee angle and ball speed, other factors such as player technique and environmental factors can also influence this relationship. Therefore, more research is needed to understand the additional factors that influence this relationship as well as to establish a causal relationship between the two variables.",1
Reliability and Validity of Temporal Parameters during the Side Hop Test in Patients after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2024-06-11,2024,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Anna Stitelmann, Lara Allet, Stéphane Armand, Philippe Tscholl","Background: The side hop test (SHT) measures the number of jumps performed over 30 s. Although this measure has demonstrated its value in clinical practice, the temporal parameters of the SHT allow for a deeper analysis of the execution strategy. The aim of this study is to assess the reliability and construct validity of contact time parameters during the SHT recorded by a video analysis system in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed (ACLR) patients. Methods: We investigated the reliability (intra-rater, standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC)), discriminant validity (operated (OP) versus non-operated (NOP) side), and convergent validity (relationship with strength and psychological readiness) of SHT contact time parameters, number of valid hops and limb symmetry index (LSI) in 38 ACLR patients. Contact time parameters are presented as mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of contact time. Results: Intra-tester reliability was good to excellent for all contact time parameters. For discriminant validity, the mean and SD contact times of the OP leg were significantly longer than those of the NOP leg, although the difference was smaller than the SEM and MDC values. The number of valid jumps and CV contact time parameters were not significantly different. Isokinetic quadriceps strength (60°/s) was strongly correlated with mean contact time for both legs. However, psychological readiness was not correlated with any of the contact time parameters. Conclusions: Temporal parameters of the SHT measured on video analysis are valid and reliable parameters to assess the performance strategy of the SHT. The results should be interpreted with caution regarding the SEM and MDC values. Further studies are needed to measure criterion validity, inter-rater reliability, and responsiveness.",1

The secondary objective was to detail the data collection and reporting methods used in the included studies to present heading incidence data. Eligible studies were identified through searches of five electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science, using a combination of free-text keywords (inception to 12th September 2023). Manual searching of reference lists and retrieved systematic reviews was also performed. A descriptive overview and synthesis of the results is presented. From 1620 potentially eligible studies, 71 studies were included, with the following key findings: 1) only 61% of studies defined a header with even fewer (23%) providing an operational definition of a header within the methods; 2) important study and player demographic data including year and country were often not reported; 3) reported heading descriptors and their coding options varied greatly; 4) visual identification of headers was essential when inertial measurement units were used to collect heading incidence data; and 5) there was a lack of standardisation in the reporting methods used in heading incidence studies making comparison between studies challenging. To address these findings, the development of a standardised, internationally supported, operational definition of a header and related heading descriptors should be prioritised. Further recommendations include the development of minimum reporting criteria for heading incidence research.",1
The effect of football heading on sidestep cutting biomechanics,2024-06-07,2024,Northumbria University Library,"Graduate Journal of Sports Science, Coaching, Management, &amp; Rehabilitation","Grace Adebamiyo Ademolu, Liis Uiga, Greg Wood, Kat Daniels","Heading is an integral part of football, with ~20 headers or aerial duels executed per game to intercept, pass or score. However, concerns have recently been raised about the potential short and long-term health impacts of repeated heading. There is evidence suggesting increased risks of sub-concussive trauma – head impacts that do not result in obvious symptoms of concussion but affect cognition and motor function (Montenigro et al., 2017, J Neurotra, 34, 328-340). Repeated heading has been demonstrated to alter brain-muscle communication and affect movement control (Parr et al., 2023, Front Hu Neuro, 17, 1145700) and mechanics of simple tasks such as jumping (Lapointe et al., 2018, Int J Psychophys, 132, 93-98). However, whether these observed cognition and motor impairments translate to the biomechanics of complex multidirectional sport-specific movements such as sidestep cutting is not known. This is an important area to understand because sidestep cutting, an acute change of direction which is ubiquitous in football, is an important performance-determining factor and also a common inciting event for lower-limb injuries (Alentorn-Geli et al., 2009, Knee Sur Sports Trauma, Arth, 17, 705-729) such as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Due to its propensity to generate high multiplanar knee joint loading during the stance phase of the manoeuvre (Dempsey et al., 2009, Am J Sports Med, 37, 2194-2200), there are often high stresses on the lower limbs which can result in musculoskeletal injury. To date, a copious number of studies have analysed the biomechanics of the sidestep cutting manoeuvre, showing that knee loading is sensitive to the constraints and strategies used to manoeuvre (Dos’Santos et al., 2019, Strength Cond J, 41, 40-54). Accordingly, this present study aims to determine whether there is an effect of repeated heading on sidestep-cutting biomechanics and, if so, the nature of this effect. Participants (n=40) will perform reactive and pre-planned sidestep cutting manoeuvres before completing 15 virtual (n=20) or physical (n=20) ball-heading. They will then repeat the cutting tasks immediately after the bout of heading. Whole-body optical motion capture, ground reaction forces, tri-planar lower-limb joint angles and moments during the stance phase will be analysed to test the effects of football heading on sidestep cutting biomechanics. Results may indicate whether exposure to football heading is a potential risk factor for lower-limb/ACL injury and thus inform the development of training sessions, athlete monitoring, and organisational/national heading guidance and policy for matches and training.",1
Evaluating the impact of virtual reality game training on upper limb motor performance in children and adolescents with developmental coordination disorder: a scoping review using the ICF framework,2024-06-05,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,"Mohammed Alharbi, Haoyang Du, David Harris, Greg Wood, Helen Dodd, Gavin Buckingham","Abstract Objective This scoping review aims to explore published literature testing Virtual Reality (VR) interventions for improving upper limb motor performance in children and adolescents with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). Our primary focus was on the types of VR systems used and the measurement tools employed within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY) domains in these studies. Methods A comprehensive search of six electronic databases up to 11th January 2024 was conducted using predefined terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to determine study eligibility, with two authors independently assessing titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Results Out of 788 potential studies, 14 met the eligibility criteria. Studies predominantly utilized non-immersive VR (nVR) systems, for example, commercial platforms such as Nintendo Wii. Most interventions targeted general motor coordination or balance, with only four studies specifically focusing on upper limb motor performance. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 was the predominant assessment tool. However, the use of game scores and trial durations raised concerns about the accuracy of assessments. The majority of studies reported no significant improvement in upper limb motor performance following VR interventions, though some noted improvements in specific tasks or overall outcomes. Conclusion The findings suggest that, while nVR interventions are being explored for paediatric motor rehabilitation, their impact on enhancing upper limb motor performance in children with DCD is unclear. The variability in intervention designs, outcome measures, and the predominant focus on general motor skills rather than specific upper limb improvements highlight the need for more targeted research in this area. Impact This review underscores the importance of developing precise and clinically relevant measurement tools in a broader range of VR technologies to optimize the use of VR in therapy for children with DCD. Future research should aim for more rigorous study designs and emerging immersive technologies to maximize therapeutic benefits.",1
"Application of Machine Learning Methods to Investigate Joint Load in Agility on the Football Field: Creating the Model, Part I",2024-06-05,2024,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Anne Benjaminse, Eline M. Nijmeijer, Alli Gokeler, Stefano Di Paolo","Laboratory studies have limitations in screening for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk due to their lack of ecological validity. Machine learning (ML) methods coupled with wearable sensors are state-of-art approaches for joint load estimation outside the laboratory in athletic tasks. The aim of this study was to investigate ML approaches in predicting knee joint loading during sport-specific agility tasks. We explored the possibility of predicting high and low knee abduction moments (KAMs) from kinematic data collected in a laboratory setting through wearable sensors and of predicting the actual KAM from kinematics. Xsens MVN Analyze and Vicon motion analysis, together with Bertec force plates, were used. Talented female football (soccer) players (n = 32, age 14.8 ± 1.0 y, height 167.9 ± 5.1 cm, mass 57.5 ± 8.0 kg) performed unanticipated sidestep cutting movements (number of trials analyzed = 1105). According to the findings of this technical note, classification models that aim to identify the players exhibiting high or low KAM are preferable to the ones that aim to predict the actual peak KAM magnitude. The possibility of classifying high versus low KAMs during agility with good approximation (AUC 0.81–0.85) represents a step towards testing in an ecologically valid environment.",1

The integration of various systems and devices has brought about significant transformations in established sports practices, impacting not only the rules but also physiological, biomechanical, and even psychological aspects. Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of an attention intervention through a video game on young soccer players. Methods Twelve young male soccer players (age: mean 8.5, SD 1 years) were divided into 2 groups: a control group (CG; n=10) and an experimental group (EG; n=10). During the 6-week training program, the EG received attention training through a video game twice a week for 15 minutes per session. Pre- and postintervention measurements included a specific decision-making soccer test and interviews with coaching staff. Additionally, success in the video game, muscular activity, and sweat levels were monitored. Results The EG demonstrated a significant improvement in video game success following the intervention program, as indicated by the achieved level ( P &lt;.001). However, no significant differences were found between groups regarding electromyographic (EMG) activity ( P =.21) and sweating ( P =.20). Prior to implementing the attention training program, both groups exhibited similar data for variables related to decision-making and execution mechanisms (≤10%). Only 2 decision-making variables exceeded 10% but remained below 15% (Shot_D=13.35%; Marking_with_Ball_D=−12.64%). Furthermore, changes in attacking action variables were more pronounced in execution-related variables, except for dribbling and fixing. Conversely, in defensive action variables, changes were greater in decision-related variables, except for marking with the ball and marking without the ball. Conclusions Our findings reveal that incorporating a specific attentional video game into a soccer training program enhances decision-making compared to a program without the video game. Therefore, it is advisable for practitioners to consider using this tool due to its high efficiency in terms of economic and temporal costs, particularly in improving a key psychological variable.",1
"A Systematic Review of Effects on ACL Injury of Soccer Shoe Outsoles, Soccer Playing Field Surfaces, and Outsole–Surface Interface",2024-05-24,2024,MDPI AG,Encyclopedia,"Antonio Cicchella, Jierui He","Soccer is a sport with a high incidence of injuries. The most common injury occurs when the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee has undergone a sprain, strain, or partial or total rupture. Besides fitness factors (e.g., proprioception, balance and strength capabilities), a principal cause of ACL injuries is sport shoes and playing surfaces. Especially with the emergence of artificial surfaces (rubbers, turfs, concrete, asphalt, red turf), the ACL injuries dramatically increase. The cost of ACL injuries is high both in terms of career termination and in social and economic costs. Thus, it is necessary to understand the impact of sport shoes and playing surfaces on the ACL and how it can be mitigated. The present literature review followed the PRISMA methodology to identify the major biomechanical factors influencing the behavior of surfaces and shoes in relation to the ACL damage. Fifty-eight papers were identified. After reviewing the mechanism of injuries, we identified several distinct factors: type of outsole and mechanical arrangement of the outsoles; shear forces; characteristics of artificial turf surfaces; effect of weather on artificial surface aging and change in mechanical characteristics; outsole/ground interface; and the frictional, tractional and rotational forces in the pathogenesis of ACL injuries in soccer.",1

Method Participants were randomly allocated into VPT (n = 8), HPT (n = 8) and V+HPT (n = 8) groups which undertook eight weeks of PT, executing 100 foot contacts per session, twice weekly. Results Though demonstrably effective, no specific one of the three applied programmes enhanced performance to a greater extent than another with only the 40 m sprint for the HPT group (mean difference = 0.07 s [HPT] vs. 0.04 s [VPT] and 0.04 s [V+HPT]) and the vertical jump for the V+HPT group (mean difference = 4.5 cm [V+HPT] vs. 4.0 cm [VPT] and 3.25 cm [HPT]) appearing to deviate from a uniform pattern of group level adaptation across the performance tests. Conclusion A total volume of 100 foot contacts per session, twice per week for eight weeks was sufficient to achieve the observed changes. Though jump and changing direction performance were enhanced, linear sprint performance was largely unchanged and so a more complete and intense programme may have been warranted. No method was superior to another in eliciting changes across these tests and a directionally-specific pattern of adaptation was not apparent.",1
The effects of two different fatigue protocols on movement quality during anticipated and unanticipated change of directions in female soccer players,2024-05-22,2024,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Mohammad Alimoradi, Elham Hosseini, Mansour Sahebozamani, Thomas Dos’Santos, Shima Sheikhbahaie, Roya Bigtashkhani, Aryan Kabiri","Objective This study compared neuromuscular control under two fatigue protocols during anticipated and unanticipated change of direction (COD) maneuvers and evaluated their effects on the risk of non-contact ACL injuries. Method Forty-five female soccer players (mean age: 22.22 ± 2.24 years; mean height: 166.24 ± 3.33 cm; mean mass: 59.84 ± 5.03 kg) were divided into three groups: functional fatigue (Soccer specific fatigue ptotocol-SOFT90), non-functional fatigue (Bruce protocol), and control group. Before and after the implementation of neuromuscular control fatigue protocols were evaluated using the cutting motion assessment score tool (CMAS). Two-dimensional (2D) videos were recorded during anticipated and unanticipated COD trials for both dominant and non-dominant legs. Results Significant time effects (p &lt; 0.05) and group-time interactions (p &lt; 0.05) were observed in both anticipated and unanticipated conditions for both dominant and non-dominant legs after the fatigue protocols. The functional fatigue group exhibited higher CMAS changes, indicating poorer movement quality following fatigue. Notably, the non-dominant leg displayed amplified deficits during unanticipated COD maneuvers following the functional fatigue protocol. Conclusions Fatigue significantly impairs neuromuscular control, particularly in unanticipated COD situations, which increases the risk of non-contact ACL injuries. To mitigate this risk, coaches, trainers, and medical professionals should prioritize targeted training and injury prevention strategies, focusing on the non-dominant leg during unanticipated COD maneuvers.",1
3-Dimensional Biomechanics of Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Male Professional Soccer Players,2024-05-14,2024,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Matteo Zago, Fabio Esposito, Susanna Stillavato, Stefano Zaffagnini, Carlo Albino Frigo, Francesco Della Villa","Background: The understanding of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury causation in soccer has improved over the past decades. Bidimensional video analyses have significantly augmented our awareness, representing to date the only practical method to describe injury biomechanics. However, the extent of the problem continues to raise serious concerns. Purpose: To advance our understanding of the causal pathways leading to ACL injury with a large-scale reconstruction of 3-dimensional (3D) whole-body joint kinematics of injuries that occurred to male elite soccer players, as well as to compare the joint angle time course among situational patterns. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: A total of 33 consecutive noncontact and indirect contact ACL injuries that occurred in 6 national and 2 international professional leagues (seasons 2020-2021 to 2022-2023 until December 2022) were analyzed: (1) multiview noncoaxial television images were inspected; (2) multiple camera views were taken from 400 ms before the initial ground contact to 200 ms after the injury frame; (3) a size-matched pitch was modeled and used to calibrate cameras; (4) a 3D skeletal model was adjusted to fit the player's pose in each frame/view; and (5) poses were interpolated, and Euler joint angles were extracted. Results: The authors reconstructed the 3D lower limb joint kinematic curves preceding and during ACL injuries in 33 cases; notably, a sudden external (up to 5°) and then internal knee rotation was observed after the initial contact and before the injury frame. The overall kinematics at injury were knee moderately flexed (45.9°± 21.7°), abducted (4.3°± 5.1°), and externally rotated (3.0°± 6.4°); trunk shallowly flexed (17.4°± 12.5°) and rotated and tilted toward the injured side; and hip flexed (32.0°± 18.7°), abducted (31.1°± 12.0°), and slightly internally rotated (6.6°± 12.2°). Variable behaviors were observed at the ankle level. Conclusion: Via reconstruction of the sequence of whole-body joint motion leading to injury, we confirmed the accepted gross biomechanics (dynamic valgus trend). This study significantly enriches the current knowledge on multiplanar kinematic features (transverse and coronal plane rotations). Furthermore, it was shown that ACL injuries in male professional soccer players manifest through distinct biomechanical footprints related to the concurrent game situation. Clinical Relevance: Interventions aimed at reducing ACL injuries in soccer should consider that environmental features (ie, situational patterns) affect injury mechanics.",1

Kinematic data were recorded using a 3D inertial motion capture system in 21 male semi-professional soccer players during 40-metre overground sprint. Scaled musculoskeletal models were used to estimate peak MT strain in the hamstring over 16 steps. Biceps femoris long head (BFLH) exhibited the largest peaks in MT strain compared to semitendinosus (ST) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles across all the steps, with its overall strain decreased as the number of steps and maximum speed increased. Hip flexion angle was found to be a strong predictor (p < 0.001) of joint angles, being the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane of the segment with the greatest influence (p < 0.001) on the peak MT strain of BFLH during sprinting. The current study provides a biomechanical explanation for the high proportion of hamstring injuries in the acceleration phase of sprinting.",1
Does Strength Training Decrease the Risk of Sports Related Knee Injury?,2024-05-02,2024,Rowan University Libraries,Research Posters,"Zachary J. Noll, Quin W. Buob","The knee is the most common joint affected by sports-related injuries, with approximately 2.5 million cases treated annually in the US alone, alongside 2 million worldwide ACL repairs. Among athletes engaged in contact sports like football, soccer, basketball, and volleyball, ACL tears are the primary injury concern. In non-contact sports, particularly running, meniscus tears are commonly experienced. A notable 23% of college athletes encounter knee injuries to varying degrees. Many risk factors have been identified including patient sex, activity type, and body composition, justifying the need for individualized preventive measures. Various strength training protocols have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of ACL tears, meniscus tears, and patellar tendinopathy pain. Enhancements in muscle activation ratios and biomechanical parameters resulting from strength training contribute to ACL injury risk reduction. Both male and female athletes have benefited in injury risk reduction from strength training, yet the optimal protocol remains undetermined. Nonetheless, diverse training methodologies yield risk reduction benefits, regardless of the onset age of strength training. While knee injuries pose a significant burden in sports, targeted strength training interventions offer promising avenues for injury prevention. Further research is warranted to find optimal training variety, frequency, and intensity and their effects across different athlete demographics.",1
The Effect of Acute Focus of Attention Instructions on Biomechanical Indexes Associated With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Prevention,2024-05-01,2024,Negah Scientific Publisher,Scientific Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine,"Nazanin Dalvandpour, Mostafa Zarei","Background and Aims Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common and serious injuries of the knee joint, which accounts for 80% of all knee ligament surgeries. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of this injury (70%) occurs in a non-contact form, usually during activities like deceleration, landing, or side cutting. Studies have shown that focus instructions could improve and promote performance. This study aimed to investigate the acute effect of focus instructions on biomechanical indexes associated with ACL injury prevention. Methods In this research, 24 young football players from the two clubs of the Tehran Premier League, Tehran City, Iran, were randomly divided into two groups: external focus attention (n=12) and internal focus attention (n=12). First, the dynamic postural stability index (DPSI), the peak of vertical, anteroposterior, and mediolateral GRF components, and the rate of loading during the jump-landing movement from a box with 30 cm height were calculated using a force plate with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz. Then, the internal and external focus instructions were taught to the participants, and the two groups performed a posttest to examine the changes. Statistical methods of repeated measures analysis of variance and paired t test were used to evaluate the changes. Results The results showed significant changes in the vertical component and rate of loading variables in both groups of internal and external focus attention (P≤0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in the DPSI, anteroposterior and mediolateral GRF. Conclusion The results of this study showed that acute instructions of both internal and external focus attention can improve landing mechanics and landing-related kinetic variables. It seems that the external focus instructions have increased the motor control of the limb, leading to a further reduction of vertical GRF and the load applied to the lower limb compared to the instructions of internal focus, thus reducing the risk of ACL injury.",1

Athletes were randomly divided into groups of seven to use soft, medium and hard foam rollers. The athletes applied the method consisting of two sets of one minute on the dominant hamstring muscle. Measurements were made twice, before the application (BA) and after the application (AA). The muscle stiffness measurement of the soccer players was determined BA mean of 16.26 N/m and AA mean of 16.17 N/m.. Flexibility measurement was determined BA mean of 28,36 cm and AA mean of 31,05 cm. It was found that the mean of pre-test and post-test did not differ statistically for muscle stiffness (p&gt;0,05) according to measurement times, but statistically differed for flexibility (p0,05). It shows that foam roller application is important for increasing muscle flexibility, but there is no difference between foam roller models applied at different intensities in terms of removing muscle stiffness and increasing flexibility.",1
Changes in Lower Limb Biomechanics Across Various Stages of Maturation and Implications for ACL Injury Risk in Female Athletes: a Systematic Review,2024-04-26,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Akhilesh Kumar Ramachandran, Jason S. Pedley, Sylvia Moeskops, Jon L. Oliver, Gregory D. Myer, Rhodri S. Lloyd","Abstract Background Female athletes are four to six times more likely to sustain an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury than male athletes. Jump-landing biomechanics are influenced by maturation, with post-pubertal female athletes at a heightened risk of ACL injuries. Objective The aim of our systematic review was to identify and summarise the current evidence regarding the changes in kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries during jump-landing tasks in female athletes at various stages of maturity. Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE and Scopus. Articles were included if they: (1) conducted the research on uninjured female athletes with no restriction on playing level/experience; (2) provided information regarding the stage of the maturity and the scale used for estimating the maturity status of the participants; and (3) reported a biomechanical risk factor associated with ACL injuries during jump-landing tasks across at least two different maturity groups (e.g. pre-pubertal vs post-pubertal). Results Sixteen articles involving 2323 female athletes were included in our review. A total of 12 kinematic and 8 kinetic variables were identified across these studies. Of the 12 kinematic variables reported in our review, we found strong evidence for higher peak knee abduction angle in post-pubertal female individuals compared with pre-pubertal girls ( p &lt; 0.05). With regard to the 8 kinetic variables, we found strong evidence for lower relative peak vertical ground reaction force, higher external knee abduction moment and internal rotation moment in post-pubertal compared with pre-pubertal athletes. The strength of evidence for the remaining kinematic and kinetic variables ranged from conflicting to moderate and, in some instances, could not be determined. Conclusions Our study provides an overview of the changes in biomechanical risk factors in female athletes during jump-landing tasks at various stages of maturity. We found moderate-to-limited evidence for most kinematic and kinetic variables, highlighting the need for further research.",1
Intra- and inter-limb strength imbalance and asymmetry in soccer: A comparison of elite senior and junior players,2024-04-26,2024,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Robert Śliwowski, Thierry Paillard, Łukasz Bojkowski, Witold Dudziński, Mikołaj Patek, Jakub Marynowicz","Evaluation of muscle strength imbalance can be an important element in optimizing the training process of soccer players. The purpose of the study was to examine isokinetic peak torque (PT) and total work (TW) exerted by both knee extensors (quadriceps or Q) and flexors (hamstrings or H), intra-limb imbalance and the magnitude and direction of inter-limb asymmetry in top elite senior (n = 109) and junior (n = 74) soccer players. An isokinetic dynamometry was used to measure maximum peak torque of quadriceps (PT-Q) and hamstrings (PT-H) at an angular velocity of 60° ·s-1, as well as the total work for extensors (TW-Q) and flexors (TW-H) at an angular velocity of 240° ·s-1 in the dominant (DL) and non-dominant leg (NDL) during concentric muscle contraction. Intra-limb imbalance and inter-limb asymmetries were calculated using a standard equation. Statistical analysis using t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test revealed: (a) no differences (p > 0.05) between groups for PT-Q and PT-H, (b) greater strength levels (p < 0.05) for TW-Q and TW-H of senior players than juniors, and (c) no differences (p > 0.05) between groups for intra-limb imbalance and inter-limb asymmetry. Additionally, Pearson's chi-kwadrat (χ2) analysis showed no differences (p > 0.05) between groups for intra-limb imbalance and inter-limb asymmetry in relation to the 'normative' values accepted in the literature that indicate an increase in the risk of knee injury. This study shows that isokinetic assessment can be an important tool to identify imbalances/asymmetries and to develop strategies to reduce the risk of muscle injury.",1
Relationship Between Individual and Composite FMS™ Scores with the Anthropometric and Physical Characteristics of Elite Touch (Rugby) Players,2024-04-26,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Science in Sport and Exercise,"Cari Thorpe, Nick Dobbin, Craig Twist, Michael Callaghan","Abstract Purpose To describe and compare the movement patterns, anthropometric and physical characteristics of male and female Touch players; and examine the relationships between Functional Movement Screening (FMS ™ ) scores and the anthropometric and physical characteristics. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with 35 elite Touch players (18 males, age = 24.7 ± 4.9 years; 17 females, age = 26.7 ± 5.2 years). Anthropometric (stature, body mass) and physical characteristics (sprint times, glycolytic change-of-direction test, and countermovement jump (CMJ) flight time and peak power) were assessed alongside movement patterns using the FMS ™ battery. Data were analysed for between-sex differences (independent t -test, Mann–Whitney U) and relationships (Spearman’s correlation coefficient). Results Between-sex differences in body mass ( t = 6.082, P &lt; 0.001), stature ( t = 9.247, P &lt; 0.001), CMJ flight time ( t = 3.576, P = 0.001), relative CMJ peak power ( t = 6.578, P &lt; 0.001), 10 m sprint time ( t = 15.861, P &lt; 0.001), glycolytic change of direction test time ( t = − 11.831, P &lt; 0.001) and Yo–Yo IR1 ( t = 6.842, P &lt; 0.001) were observed. There were minimal differences for deep squat ( Z = − 1.036, P = 0.443), in-line lunge ( Z = − 1.284, P = 0.303), shoulder mobility ( Z = − 0.173, P = 0.883), trunk stability push-up ( Z = − 0.896, P = 0.483) and rotary stability ( Z = − 1.537, P = 0.273). The correlation between total and individual FMS ™ scores with anthropometric and physical characteristics ranged from trivial-to-moderate ( r = − 0.502 to 0.488). Conclusion The lack of difference for the FMS ™ composite score and small-to-trivial differences in individual scores allows a comparison between mixed populations within Touch. Whilst many of the correlations were trivial-to-small, there were differences between sexes in the associations and evidence that improvements in functional deficiencies could translate into improved physical performance.",1

Enhancing Sidestep Cutting Execution in Talented Female Soccer Players: A Four-Week Intervention Program With Video Instruction",2024-04-25,2024,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research,"Eline M. Nijmeijer, Matthias Kempe, Marije T. Elferink-Gemser, Anne Benjaminse","Abstract Nijmeijer, EM, Kempe, M, Elferink-Gemser, MT, and Benjaminse A. Observe, practice and improve? Enhancing sidestep cutting (SSC) execution in talented female soccer players: A four-week intervention program with video instruction. J Strength Cond Res 38(8): e430–e439, 2024—Implicit learning has the potential to improve movement execution and reduce injury risk. Previous research showed beneficial effects of short-term interventions with implicit learning in male athletes. However, research on long-term interventions in female athletes is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a 4-week intervention with video instruction on movement execution of SSC, a task that is highly related with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk, in female athletes. Twenty talented adolescent female soccer players were part of the control (CTRL, n = 10) or video instruction (VIDEO, n = 10) group. All subjects practiced 4 weeks and received general task instructions. In addition, the VIDEO group received expert video instruction during practice. Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics and vertical ground reaction force of SSC were examined during baseline, immediate post, and 1-week retention tests. After nonlinear registration, differences between each subject and the expert she had seen were determined. These differences were analyzed with SPM1D 2-way ANOVA. No interaction effects between time and group were found ( p &gt; 0.05). Main effects of time were found in the frontal plane. In particular, smaller deviations of subjects compared with the seen expert of the knee adduction ( p = 0.005, 97.9–100% stance phase [SP]) and hip abduction ( p = 0.005, 11.5–13.8% SP) and adduction ( p &lt; 0.001, 33.4–87.7% SP) moments were found in immediate post compared with baseline. These frontal plane short-term improvements, replicating earlier findings in both sexes, may lower ACL injury risk. The large observed interindividual differences over time may have concealed the long-term effects of video instruction at the group level.",1
Biomechanics of athlete movement: kinematic analysis and injury prevention,2024-04-25,2024,Science Research Society,Journal of Electrical Systems,Wenqing Chang,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are prevalent and movement patterns linked to an increased risk of ACL damage can be seen in youngsters under the age of 10. Though the processes underlying these programs are mostly unclear, prevention systems have been demonstrated to lower rates of injury. Biomechanical alterations following injury prevention programs in children have not been extensively studied. In this study, we examine the manner in which modifications in bio-mechanical risk variables for an ACL injury in preadolescent female soccer players are affected by the F-MARC 11+ injury-preventing warm-up program. Our hypothesis was that training would enhance peak knee valgus moment (PKVM), the key risk factor for ACL injuries. Other kinematic and kinetic factors connected to ACL injury were also investigated. An intervention group and a control group were created from a total of 62 athletes who were recruited from soccer teams. F-MARC 11+ in-season sessions were attended by the intervention group fifteen times. Motion capture information from the pre and post-season was gathered while doing activities such as double-leg leap, single-leg jump, unanticipated cutting and preplanned cutting. A biomechanical modeling system called OpenSim was used to determine the angles and moments of the lower extremity joints. According to the results of the experiment, during the double-leg leap, athletes in the group that got intervention had a lower PKVM than those in the control group. This study suggests ways to improve injury prevention programs, especially for single-leg and cutting jobs, to reduce other ACL risk factors.",1
Assessing criterion and longitudinal validity of submaximal heart rate indices as measures of cardiorespiratory fitness: A preliminary study in football,2024-04-24,2024,Elsevier BV,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Tzlil Shushan, Ric Lovell, Shaun J. McLaren, Martin Buchheit, Antonio Dello Iacono, Adriano Arguedas-Soley, Dean Norris","ObjectivesTo evaluate the criterion and longitudinal validity of field- and laboratory-derived heart rate (HR) indices of resting and submaximal fitness tests (SMFTs) as measures of cardiorespiratory fitness.DesignObservational, repeated measures.MethodsTwenty-nine semi-professional footballers participated. Laboratory assessments took place at the start and end of a preseason training period, whereby resting, SMFT HR-derived indices, and criterion measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (running economy [RE], maximal oxygen uptake [V̇O2 max] and aerobic speed [MAS]) were collected. Throughout this training period, two field-based SMFT protocols, prescribed at different intensities, were administered weekly. Individual slopes were calculated from the analysis of within-athlete change scores. Associations between laboratory and field measures were assessed via Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and linear regression models.ResultsRelationships between SMFT HR-derived indices from laboratory and field were very-large for exercise HR (r = 0.74 to 0.87) and moderate to very-large for HR recovery (0.43 to 0.76). Moderate to very-large inverse relationships were observed between exercise HR and HR recovery with V̇O2 max and MAS (−0.41 to −0.78), whereas resting HR showed no substantial relationships. Changes in exercise HR showed large and very-large inverse correlations with preseason changes in V̇O2 max (−0.54 to −0.60) and MAS (−0.64 to −0.83). Relationships between changes in HR recovery and maximal cardiorespiratory criterion measures were moderate to large (−0.32 to −0.63).ConclusionSMFT exercise HR is a valid proxy measure of cardiorespiratory fitness irrespective of test setting, whereas the validity of HRR remains elusive and appears to vary between exercise intensities.",1
Comparıson Of The Effect Of Dıfferent Pap Applıcatıons Applıed To Football Players On Blood Lactate Concentratıon After Repeated Sprınt Abılıty,2024-04-24,2024,Green Publication,Educational Administration: Theory and Practice,"Denizhan Çalışkan, Tuba Kızılet","Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the effects of different PAP applications on blood lactate measurements after RSA. Materials and Methods: 20 amateur and 3rd league licensed football players between the ages of 18-25 in Eskişehir participated in this study. The repeated sprint ability tests of the athletes were determined by the running based anaerobic sprint test (RAST). The sprint was recorded with two wireless photocell devices (Witty, Microgate, Balzano, Italy) 35 meters apart. Blood lactate measurements after RAST were measured with a Lactate Scout brand portable lactate measuring device. All statistical calculations in the study were made using the SPSS statistical package program (SPSS 26.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Shapiro-Wilk test was applied for normality analysis. According to the normality analysis, a multiple comparison two-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of different PAP applications on performance based on the results obtained only after general warm-up, and ""Bonferroni"" post-hoc analysis, one of the multiple comparison tests, was applied to determine which application favored the performance. Results: A statistically significant difference was detected in the LA variable (EB=.116 (large)) between the PAP groups according to the general warm-up of the volunteer athletes participating in the study (p<0.05). This difference was determined as PAP 1>GI. Conclusion: Statistically significant differences were detected in the LA measurements taken after RSA with the PAP 1 (3 CMJ) protocol applied to amateur and 3rd League football players between the ages of 18-25 (p<0.05). However, no difference could be detected between PAP 2 (3 CMJ +10 m sprint) and general warm-up (p>0,05).",1
Comparing the maximal horizontal deceleration demands between a novel acceleration to deceleration assessment and the 505 change of direction test,2024-04-23,2024,Asociacion Espanola de Analisis del Rendimiento Deportivo,Journal of Human Sport and Exercise,"Nicolas M. Philipp, Angeleau A. Scott, Benjamin R. Caldwell, Dimitrije Cabarkapa, Quincy R. Johnson, Andrew C. Fry","The importance of quantifying maximal horizontal deceleration performance in athlete populations has received a considerable increase in interest over recent years. However, research is still scarce investigating movement characteristics of maximal horizontal decelerations outside of measures derived from instantaneous horizontal velocity of the centre of mass, using technologies such as radar or laser-based devices. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the biomechanical differences for measures of deceleration ability between a novel deceleration task, and the 505 change of direction test, using an inertial measurement unit-based technology. Primary findings suggested differences across several biomechanical characteristics quantified during the deceleration phase, with moderate to large between-test effect sizes. Specifically, subjects were found to exhibit significantly greater reductions in velocity and horizontal braking forces in the 505. Further, subjects showed significantly shorter stopping times and distances in the acceleration-deceleration assessment, however, these displayed insufficient levels of reliability across both assessments, which should be interpreted as a limitation. Therefore, it may be speculated that based on our data, the 505 test, which possesses a predetermined stopping/turning point, presents a greater or different biomechanical challenge to individuals, which must be met with the appropriate neuromuscular and skill-related qualities to efficiently reduce whole-body momentum. These findings may be relevant to practitioners interested in choosing the right assessment to quantify athletes’ maximal horizontal deceleration performance, which can have implications for both health and performance.",1
"Biomechanical load quantification of national and regional soccer players with an inertial sensor setup during a jump, kick, and sprint task: assessment of discriminative validity",2024-04-19,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Engineering,"Bram J. C. Bastiaansen, Riemer J. K. Vegter, Erik Wilmes, Cornelis J. de Ruiter, Edwin A. Goedhart, Koen A. P. M. Lemmink, Michel S. Brink","Abstract Training load quantification methods may help optimize soccer performance. However, whole-body indicators potentially underestimate biomechanical load. A new inertial sensor setup allows joint-specific biomechanical load quantification. Good discriminative validity further supports the use of this method, and therefore the purpose of this study is to assess the discriminative validity of this method during soccer-specific activities. Twelve national and sixteen regional soccer players wore an inertial sensor setup and performed countermovement jumps, soccer kicks, and 30 m sprints. Between-group differences in angular acceleration-based biomechanical load indicators Knee Load , Hip Load , and performance were assessed using MANOVAs and Cohen’s effect sizes. Furthermore, relationships with performance were explored. National players showed higher Knee Load during jumping (mean difference: 0.11 A.U., ES = 0.93, p = 0.02), kicking (mean difference: 1.94 A.U., ES = 0.94; p = 0.02), and almost during sprinting (mean difference: 12.85, ES = 0.77; p = 0.05). Hip Load did not differ between groups across all tasks, although national players outperformed regional players on all tests. Significant relationships between Knee Load ( r jump = 0.41, r kick = 0.65), Hip Load ( r jump = 0.42), and performance were observed with 95% confidence intervals ranging from trivial to large. The results confirm discriminative validity of Knee Load for jumping and kicking, but not for sprinting and Hip Load in general. The confidence intervals of the established relationships suggest that the biomechanical loads might not entirely explain between-group differences in performance. The results can be used as reference values for biomechanical load quantification in the field.",1
Mediolateral Postural Sway Velocity as a Possible Indicator of Ground Reaction Force-Derived 180⁰ Turn Performance in Male Soccer Players: A Cross-Sectional Study,2024-04-19,2024,Pamukkale University,Pamukkale Journal of Sport Sciences,"Yücel Makaracı, Kazım Nas, Mustafa Aydemir, Kerem Gündüz, Mehmet Can Gedik","The main aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between ground reaction force (GRF) derived postural sway and 180° turn performance in soccer players on the axis of dominant and non-dominant legs. Twenty-seven male soccer players (mean age 22.45 ± 2.7 years) from the same league level agreed to participate in the study. The participants underwent GRF-derived postural sway and 180⁰ turn tests using a force plate in separate sessions, with at least 24-hour intervals between sessions. Postural sway was assessed in anteroposterior and mediolateral directions during a single-leg stance, while the 180° turn performance was evaluated through GRF-derived turn time and turn sway. The correlation, multiple regression, and group differences were computed to test study hypotheses. Positive correlations were observed between postural sway measures and 180⁰ turn time for dominant and non-dominant legs (r-range from 0.384 to 0.550). No measure of postural sway was significantly related to the 180⁰ turn sway (p&amp;gt; 0.05). Multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that mediolateral sway velocity explained 30% and 17% of the variance of 180⁰ turn time for dominant and non-dominant legs, respectively. No statistical inter-limb differences were noted for 180⁰ turn and postural sway parameters. The results suggest that improving single-leg postural performance may enhance male soccer players' 180° turn performance. Therefore, unilateral stability in the mediolateral direction should be considered a potential indicator of change of direction-based performances.",1

The aim of this study is to identify genomic regions and genetic variants relevant to anterior cruciate ligament injury susceptibility that could be involved in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament ruptures. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with a PRISMA checklist and algorithm. A search of PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases was conducted using combinations of the terms “anterior cruciate ligament”, “ACL”, “rupture”, “genetics”, “single nucleotide polymorphisms”, and “SNP” since the inception of the databases until 2021. Results: Twenty-three studies were included. A total of 7724 patients were analyzed. In total, 3477 patients had ACL ruptures and 4247 patients were controls. Genetic variants in genes encoding for collagens, elastin, fibrillin, matrix metalloproteinases, proteoglycans, angiogenesis-associated signaling cascade proteins, growth differentiation factors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases, interleukins, and fibrinogen were analyzed. Conclusion: Findings regarding the association between genes encoding for collagen (COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL12A1), aggrecan (ACAN), decorin (DCN), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), biglycan (BGN), fibrinogen (FGB), and ACL injuries were found to be inconclusive. Additional evidence is required in order to establish substantial conclusions regarding the association between genetic variants and ACL rupture.",1

Hart","Abstract: Context ACL reconstruction (ACLR) patients commonly adopt poor movement patterns that potentially place them at an increased risk for reinjury if untreated. Limb loading characteristics during functional tasks can highlight movement compensations. Objective Examine loading symmetry during a bilateral bodyweight squatting task between sexes, compare loading metrics between limbs and sexes, and describe the relationship between loading metrics and patient reported outcomes (PROs) following ACLR. Design Cross-Sectional Study Setting Laboratory Patients or Other Participants 142 patients (71M/71F, 24.4±11.10yrs) with a primary, unilateral, uncomplicated ACLR completed a squatting assessment and PROs at approximately 5.2 months post-ACLR. Main Outcome Measure(s) Normalized limb loading peak force (N/kg) and unilateral cumulative load (%) were collected bilaterally during the squatting task. Limb symmetry index (%) was calculated for normalized peak force. Our first objective compared limb loading symmetry (%) between sexes using independent samples t-test. Our second objective assessed differences in limb loading metrics between limbs and sexes were analyzed via an analysis of covariance. Our third objective was assessed using Spearman Rho correlations to determine the relationship between limb loading metrics and PROs. Results The majority of individuals (91/142, 64.1%) offloaded their ACLR limb (ACLR: 6.6±1.56 N/kg; contralateral: 7.3±1.61 N/kg, p&amp;lt;0.001). Females significantly offloaded their ACLR limb (ACLR: 6.3±1.38 N/kg; contralateral: 7.2±1.62 N/kg, p&amp;lt;0.001) where males did not significantly offload their ACLR limb (ACLR 6.98±1.65 N/kg; contralateral: 7.4±1.60, p=0.07). Weak relationships were observed (ρ-value range: -0.23 to 0.19) across limb loading metrics and PROs. Conclusion Individuals approximately five months following ACLR, on average, offloaded their ACLR limb compared to the contralateral limb. Patients’ tendency to offload their weight during a squat was influenced by sex. Relationships between limb loading metrics and PROs indicate patients who load their limbs disproportionately have a lower perception in their capability to complete activities of daily living and lower subjective knee function.",1

The unidirectional porous tricalcium β-phosphate (UDPTCP) has the potential to be used as a filling substitute for bone defects. In this case series, we present the first nine cases in which UDPTCP was used as a bone substitute in the tibial tunnel during ACL reconstruction. The patients comprised six males and three females, with an average age of 32 years (range: 16-50 years). A cylindrical UDPTCP measuring 10 x 20 mm was molded to fit the tibial tunnel and then implanted. At the one-year postoperative follow-up, none of the patients demonstrated any complications, and bone remodeling was observed on radiographs. Therefore, UDPTCP may provide a safe and reliable filling substitute for the tibial tunnel in ACL reconstruction.",1
Effect of Step Height and Visual Feedback on the Lower Limb Kinematics Before and After Landing,2024-04-15,2024,Korean Research Society of Physical Therapy,Physical Therapy Korea,Jangwhon Yoon,"Background: Landing from a step or stairs is a basic motor skill but high incidence of lateral ankle sprain has been reported during landing with inverted foot.Objects: This study aimed to investigate the effect of landing height and visual feedback on the kinematics of landing and supporting lower limbs before and after the touch down and the ground reaction force(GRF)s.Methods: Eighteen healthy females were voluntarily participated in landing from the lower (20 cm) and the higher (40 cm) steps with and without visual feedback.To minimize the time to plan the movement, the landing side was randomly announced as a starting signal.Effects of the step height, the visual feedback, or the interaction on the landing duration, the kinematic variables and the GRFs at each landing event point were analyzed.Results: With eyes blindfolded, the knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion on landing side significantly decreased before and after the touch down.However, there was no significant effect of landing height on the anticipatory kinematics on the landing side.After the touch down, the landings from the higher step increased the knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion on both landing and supporting sides.From the higher steps, the vertical GRF, anterior GRF, and lateral GRF increased.No interaction between step height and visual feedback was significant. Conclusion:Step height and visual feedback affected the landing limb kinematics independently.Visual feedback affected on the landing side while step height altered the supporting side prior to the touch down.After the touch down, the step height had greater influence on the lower limb kinematics and the GRFs than the visual feedback.Findings of this study can contribute to understanding of the injury mechanisms and preventing the lateral ankle sprain.",1
The Role of MRI in Groin Pain Syndrome in Athletes,2024-04-14,2024,MDPI AG,Diagnostics,"Gian Nicola Bisciotti, Francesco Di Pietto, Giovanni Rusconi, Andrea Bisciotti, Alessio Auci, Marcello Zappia, Stefania Romano","Groin pain syndrome (GPS) is one of the most frequent injuries in competitive sports. Stresses generated in the lower limbs by quick turns and accelerations, such as in soccer, basketball or hockey, can produce localized regions of increased forces, resulting in anatomical lesions. The differential diagnoses are numerous and comprise articular, extra-articular, muscular, tendinous and visceral clinical conditions and a correct diagnosis is crucial if treatment is to be efficient. MRI is the gold standard of diagnostic techniques, especially when an alternative pathology needs to be excluded and/or other imaging techniques such as ultrasound or radiography do not lead to a diagnosis. This paper, based on the current literature, gives a comprehensive review of the anatomy of the pubic region and of the typical MRI findings in those affected by GPS. Many clinical conditions causing GPS can be investigated by MRI within appropriate protocols. However, MRI shows limits in reliability in the investigation of inguinal and femoral hernias and therefore is not the imaging technique of choice for studying these clinical conditions.",1
Comparative Effectiveness of Supervised and Home-Based Rehabilitation after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Competitive Athletes,2024-04-12,2024,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Rehan Iftikhar Bukhari Syed, Laszlo Rudolf Hangody, Gergely Frischmann, Petra Kós, Bence Kopper, István Berkes","Background: After the increasingly common anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) procedure in competitive athletes, rehabilitation is crucial for facilitating a timely return to sports (RTS) and preventing re-injury. This pilot study investigates the patient-reported outcomes of postoperative rehabilitation in competitive athletes, comparing supervised rehabilitation (SVR) and home-based rehabilitation (HBR). Methods: After ACLR, 60 (out of 74 screened) athletes were recruited and equally divided into HBR and SVR groups using non-probability convenience sampling, with each group comprising 15 males and 15 females. The rehabilitation outcomes in the respective groups were evaluated at 8 months using measures (Tegner Activity Scale [TAS], International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC-SKF], ACL Return to Sport after Injury [ACL-RSI]) and objective parameters (isometric muscle strength, hamstring/quadricep asymmetry). RTS was evaluated at 9 months, with ACL re-injury rates recorded approximately 6 months post-RTS. Results: Both groups exhibited decreased TAS scores (HBR: 8 to 6, SVR: 8 to 7), with the SVR group demonstrating superior postoperative IKDC-SKF scores (81.82 vs. 68.43) and lower ACL-RSI scores (49.46 vs. 55.25). Isometric and isokinetic muscle strength, along with asymmetry values, was higher in the SVR group 8 months post-ACLR (p &lt; 0.05). The SVR group showed a higher RTS rate to the same level (76.6% vs. 53.3%), while the re-injury rate was the same in both the rehabilitation groups (3.3%). Conclusions: Although both rehabilitation approaches yielded comparable outcomes, SVR may demonstrate some superior biomechanical improvements in athletes, resulting in a higher RTS rate. However, the psychological outcomes and re-injury rates did not significantly differ between the groups, emphasizing the need to address individual psychological needs during rehabilitation. Further investigation is recommended with a larger sample size to address the differences of gender among competitive athletes.",1

In this study, we investigated the DKV via electromyography during single-leg landing considering the hip-joint fatigue task (HFT) and knee-joint fatigue task (KFT) performed by healthy men. We recruited 16 healthy male participants who performed a single-leg jump-landing motion from a height of 20 cm before and after an isokinetic hip abduction/adduction task (HFT) and knee extension/flexion task (KFT). Three-dimensional motion analysis systems were attached to the left gluteus medius and quadriceps, and surface electromyography was used to analyze the lower limb kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity. The primary effects and interactions of the task and fatigue were identified based on the two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. The results of the average angle during landing indicated that DKV occurs in KFT, whereas HFT applies external forces that adduct and internally rotate the knee at peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF). Furthermore, both KFT and HFT exhibited an increase in muscle activity in the quadriceps. The analysis revealed that the occurrence of DKV varies depending on the peripheral fatigue task, and the effects on average DKV during landing and DKV at peak vGRF vary depending on the peripheral fatigue task.",1
"The relationship between agility, linear sprinting, and vertical jumping performance in U-14 and professional senior team sports players",2024-04-09,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Thordis Gisladottir, Miloš Petrović, Filip Sinković, Dario Novak","Aim The aim of this paper is to determine the relationship between the modified agility T -test (change of direction speed ability), 20-meter sprint test (linear speed ability), and countermovement jump test (vertical jumping performance) in U-14 and professional senior team sports players. Methods The sample included 78 (59 female and 19 male) U-14 athletes (age 11.70 ± 1.33 years, height 153.00 ± 12.20 cm and body mass 47.10 ± 11.20 kg) and 43 (18 female and 25 male) senior professional athletes (age 24.80 ± 6.58 years, height 169.00 ± 9.13 cm and body mass 71.20 ± 15.10 kg). Both samples participated in different team sports including basketball, field hockey, and football. Participants underwent a series of tests to assess their speed, change of direction speed, and explosive power. Speed assessments involved 20-meter sprints (sec), while change of direction speed was measured using the modified agility T -test (sec). Explosive power was evaluated through countermovement jumps (CMJ), where concentric mean force (N), concentric peak force (N), concentric peak velocity (m/s), eccentric peak force (N), jump height (cm), peak power (W), peak power/BM (W/kg), RSI (m/s) and vertical velocity (m/s) were determined. Pearsońs product moment-correlation coefficient ( r ) served to determine correlations and linear regression was conducted to explain the relationship between the dependent variable (CODS) and independent variables (S20 m and CMJ). The level of statistical significance was set at p &amp;lt; 0.05 and the confidence interval was 95%. Results The Pearson product-moment correlation analysis in the U-14 athletes indicated no correlation ( r = 0.11, p = 0.34) between the 20-meter linear sprint speed and the modified change of direction T -test. Additionally, the results revealed that 4 out of 10 CMJ values showed a significant moderate correlation ( r = 0.3, p &amp;lt; 0.05) between CMJ and the modified change of direction T -test. In contrast, senior players exhibited statistically significant correlations in all variables. A significant correlation ( r = 0.90, p = 0.01) was found between 20-meter linear sprint speed and the modified change of direction T -test, while CMJ values showed a range of correlations from moderate to large. In both competitive categories, according to the linear regression model, only linear sprint speed over 20-meters significantly explained ( p &amp;lt; 0.05) the CODS speed ability, while the other CMJ parameters did not reach the significance level ( p &amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion The study emphasized the influence of explosive power performance (CMJ) and linear speed (S20 m) on agility (CODS) within the sample, particularly among professional senior team sports players. These findings indicate that agility, linear sprinting, and jumping abilities may share common underlying factors.",1
Entschlüsselung der Komplexität von Übergängen im Fußball: ein umfassender narrativer Überblick,2024-04-08,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research,"Pedro Eusebio, Pablo Prieto-González, Rui Marcelino","Abstract Background Transitions in football are pivotal moments in the game, carrying significant tactical and strategic implications. Despite the lack of a consensus on the exact definition and duration of transitions, their importance is evident in the analysis of football matches. Clear connections exist between performance indicators, team play styles, and specific game moments. The evolution of game analysis, facilitated by technology employing spatial, optical, and motion sensors, has heightened the recognition of transition actions. Methods This narrative review synthesizes perspectives on transitions from various authors and investigates how these perspectives have evolved over time. By utilizing real-time analysis through advanced technology, the review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of transitions in football. Results Counterattacks are identified as a key outcome emerging from transitions, affirming existing literature suggesting that each transition prompts a response from the opposing team. The review underscores the need to objectively define the dichotomy of transitions in terms of the moment of play and style of play, mitigating overlap and confusion. Conclusion Transitions are complex phenomena occurring independently of ball possession. Understanding their classification, determinants, and outcomes is crucial for optimizing team performance. By shedding light on the multifaceted nature of transitions, this review contributes to a more nuanced comprehension of this critical aspect of football strategy.",1
Impact Of Russian Current Combined With Close And Open Kinetic Chain Strengthening Exercises On ACL Revision Reconstruction Using Allograft - A Case Report,2024-04-08,2024,Green Publication,Educational Administration: Theory and Practice,"Rohit Dawande, Dr. Manibhadra Panda, Dr. Tabish Fahim, Dr. Ashwin Kshirsagar, Dr. Rohit Bhavthankar, Akash Tandale, Mayuresh Padalkar, Vaishnavi Patil, Janhavi Phatak, Sakshi Gujarathi","Introduction: Primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) restoration has been found to be a successful intervention with majority of patients experiencing functional recovery and good to exceptional clinical results in post-operative evaluations. Appropriate physiotherapy management is pivotal in the post-reconstruction phase to lower the risk of problems such as edema, pain, decreased joint range of motion, muscular weakness, muscle girth, poor balance and impaired functional activity. Method: A 23-year-old recreational football player with post-surgical case of recurrent left ACL reconstruction came to sports physiotherapy department for rehabilitation. The recurrence was managed by arthroscopic ACL revision reconstructive surgery using tibialis posterior allograft. In this case study, we evaluated the patient's pain, range of motion, strength of the muscles and muscles girth. In adherence to ACL rehabilitation protocol, we used Russian current combined with various closed and open kinetic chain exercises for improving range, thigh and leg muscles girth and also for improving the strength of thigh muscles. We also provided MFR to the lower limb muscles every alternate day, with patellar mobilization to increase range of motion along with strengthening of hamstring, quadriceps and calf. After that we used vigorous lower limb and core strengthening program with balance and proprioception training along with agility and plyometric training. Result: We compared the pain, range of motion, strength and muscles girth before and after rehab and found a significant improvement after 6 months. Conclusion: Application of Russian current was effective for pain reduction and helped in strengthening of the muscles up-to four weeks. We initially used closed kinetic chain strengthening exercises for first two weeks followed by open kinetic chain strengthening exercises, in further progression vigorous strengthening and endurance training of lower limb and core muscles, balance and proprioception, agility and plyometrics training provided a patient very good recovery and improvement in overall functional capacity of the patient after 6 months of rehabilitation.",1

The Role of Upper Body Motions in Stationary Ball-Kicking Motion: A Systematic Review,2024-04-06,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Science in Sport and Exercise,"Junze Chen, Kerry Peek, Ross Howard Sanders, Jack Lee, Johnson Chun Yiu Pang, Kanchana Ekanayake, Allan Chak Lun Fu","Abstract A ball-kicking motion requires a coordinated sequencing of all body segments for maximum ball release speed. Evidence of the role of upper body rotations and motor coordination during a ball-kicking motion is inconsistent among existing evidence. This study aimed to systematically review the role of upper body rotations on all modes of ball kicking and performance metrics. A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases from the inception was conducted. Studies reporting on the relationships between upper body rotation, and ball-kicking performance were included. From 1486 potentially relevant studies, we analysed 27 studies involving 457 participants. These studies encompassed instep soccer kicks ( n = 21), inside-of-the-foot soccer kicks ( n = 1), rugby place kicks ( n = 4) with a stationary ball, and a volley kick ( n = 1). Methodological quality assessment was performed using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria. Our results provide moderate evidence that increasing thoracolumbar rotations along the longitudinal axis and the transverse plane can enhance ball-releasing velocity through a ""whip-like effect"" based on the kinetic link principle. However, to gain a comprehensive understanding, further research is needed to explore the effects of timing and the ranges of motion of all relevant upper and lower body segments on ball release velocity and its potential influence on ball release accuracy. The current coaching manuals do not emphasise the significance of upper body rotation, indicating a pressing requirement for revisions in training guidelines to enhance ball-kicking performance.",1
Analysing the Influence of Speed and Jumping Performance Metrics on the Percentage Change of Direction Deficit in Adolescent Female Soccer Players,2024-04-03,2024,MDPI AG,Life,"Alberto Roso-Moliner, Oliver Gonzalo-Skok, Víctor Emilio Villavicencio Álvarez, Santiago Calero-Morales, Elena Mainer-Pardos","Studies show that although female soccer players often have shorter change of direction (COD) deficits than males, indicating different biomechanical profiles, there is a lack of research on the impact of physical metrics on COD performance in females. The purpose of this work was to analyse whether performance metrics based on speed and jumping could explain the variation in %CODD in young female soccer players. Thirty-three highly trained adolescent female soccer players with an age of 16 ± 0.95 years, a body mass of 55.7 ± 7.22 kg, and a height of 160.4 ± 5.22 cm performed COD180 tests, 10 m and 30 m sprint tests, single-leg countermovement, and horizontal jumps. Acceleration in the first 10 m of a sprint was identified as a significant predictor of COD180 performance (R2 = 28%), (R2 = 50%), (p &lt; 0.01), indicating that early sprint performance may largely determine an individual’s ability to change direction. However, no predictors were found for %CODD. Significant correlations were observed between COD180 performance and %CODD, acceleration, linear speed, and horizontal jump performance (r = −0.59 to 0.70; p &lt; 0.05). The study suggests that specific physical performance metrics, particularly early acceleration, are crucial for enhancing COD skills in female soccer players, emphasizing the need for targeted training interventions.",1
Factors associated with the Single Leg Squat test in female soccer players: a cross-sectional study,2024-04-02,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","John Ressman, Philip von Rosen, Wilhelmus Johannes Andreas Grooten, Eva Rasmussen-Barr","Abstract Background The Single Leg Squat (SLS) test is widely used in the clinical setting to examine and evaluate rehabilitation goals. It is simple to perform and is proposed to have biomechanical and neuromuscular similarities to athletic movements. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether demographics, previous injuries, and biomechanical and psychosocial factors are associated with the outcome of the SLS, assessed as a total score for all segments and as a separate knee segment in elite and sub-elite female soccer players. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 254 female soccer players (22 yrs; SD ± 4, height 1.69 m; SD ± 0.1, weight 64 kg; SD ± 6) from divisions 1–3 of the Swedish Soccer League. During the preseason, we assessed the participants using the SLS and tested their hip strength and ankle mobility. Demographics, previous injury, sleep quality, fear of movement, anxiety, and perceived stress were assessed with questionnaires. Logistic regression models were built to analyse the association between the outcome of the SLS and the independent variables for the dominant and non-dominant leg. Results Significantly more participants failed the SLS on the dominant leg compared with the non-dominant leg ( p &lt; 0.001). The outcome of the SLS associated with various biopsychosocial factors depending on if the dominant or non-dominant leg was tested. The total score associated with hip strength for the dominant (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–0.99, p = 0.04) and the non-dominant leg (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–0.99, p = 0.03). The knee segment associated with division level for the dominant (div 2; OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.01–5.12, p = 0.033. div 3; OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.61–5.85, p = 0.001) and non-dominant leg (div 2; OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.33-8.00, p = 0.01. div 3; OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.44–6.43, p = 0.003). Conclusions This study identified that leg dominance, division level, hip strength, and psychosocial factors were associated with the outcome of the SLS when assessed as a total score and as a separate knee segment. This indicates that clinicians need to understand that movement control is associated with factors from several domains. Whether these factors and, the results of the SLS are related to injury need to be studied prospectively. Trial registration Clinical Trials Gov, date of registration 2022-03-01.

Differences in Biomechanical Determinants of ACL Injury Risk in Change of Direction Tasks Between Males and Females: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2024-04-01,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Thomas A. Donelon, Jamie Edwards, Mathew Brown, Paul A. Jones, Jamie O’Driscoll, Thomas Dos’Santos","Abstract Background Change of direction (COD) movements are associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in multidirectional sports. Females appear at increased risk compared to males, which could be attributable to whole body kinematic strategies and greater multiplanar knee joint loads (KJLs) during COD which can increase ACL loading. Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine and quantitatively synthesise the evidence for differences between males and females regarding KJLs and their biomechanical determinants (whole body kinematic strategies determining KJLs) during COD tasks. Methods Databases including SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched (July 2021–June 2023) for studies that compared differences in knee joint loads and biomechanical determinants of KJLs during COD between males and females. Inclusion criteria were: (1) females and males with no prior history of ACL injury (18–40 years); (2) examined biomechanical determinants of KJLs and/ or KJLs during COD tasks &gt; 20°; (3) compared ≥ 1 outcome measure between males and females. Studies published between 2000 and 2023 examining a cutting task &gt; 20° with a preceding approach run that compared KJLs or the whole body multiplanar kinematics associated with them, between sexes, using three-dimensional motion analysis. Results This meta-analysis included 17 studies with a pooled sample size of 451 participants (227 males, 224 females). Meta-analysis revealed females displayed significantly less peak knee flexion during stance (SMD: 0.374, 95% CI 0.098–0.649, p = 0.008, I 2 : 0%); greater knee abduction at initial contact (IC) (SMD: 0.687, 95% CI 0.299–1.076, p = 0.001, I 2 : 55%); less hip internal rotation (SMD: 0.437, 95% CI 0.134–0.741, p = 0.005, I 2 : 34%) and hip abduction at IC (SMD: −0.454, 95% CI 0.151–0.758, p = 0.003, I 2 : 33%). No significant differences were observed between males and females for any internal or externally applied KJLs. All retrieved studies failed to control for strength, resistance training or skill history status. Conclusion No differences were observed in KJLs between males and females despite females displaying greater knee abduction at IC and less peak knee flexion during the stance phase of CODs, which are visual characteristics of non-contact ACL injury. Further research is required to examine if this translates to a similar injury risk, considering morphological differences in strain characteristics of the ACL between males and females. This observation may in part explain the disproportionate ACL injury incidence in female multidirectional athletes. Further higher quality controlled research is required whereby participants are matched by skill training history, resistance training history and strength status to ensure an appropriate comparison between males and females.",1

Soccer (football) and brain health,2024-04-01,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Journal of Neurology,"Umberto Pensato, Pietro Cortelli","Abstract Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide, played by over 270 million people and followed by many more. Several brain health benefits are promoted by practising soccer and physical exercise at large, which helps contrast the cognitive decline associated with ageing by enhancing neurogenesis processes. However, sport-related concussions have been increasingly recognised as a pressing public health concern, not only due to their acute impact but also, more importantly, due to mounting evidence indicating an elevated risk for the development of neurological sequelae following recurrent head traumas, especially chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). While soccer players experience less frequent concussions compared with other contact or combat sports, such as American football or boxing, it stands alone in its purposeful use of the head to hit the ball (headings), setting its players apart as the only athletes exposed to intentional, sub-concussive head impacts. Additionally, an association between soccer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been consistently observed, suggesting a potential “soccer-specific” risk factor. In this review, we discuss the neurological sequelae related to soccer playing, the emerging evidence of a detrimental effect related to recurrent headings, and the need for implementation of comprehensive strategies aimed at preventing and managing the burden of head impact in soccer.",1
DARI Evaluation Syndesmosis,2024-04-01,2024,SAGE Publications,Foot &amp; Ankle Orthopaedics,"Victor Anciano, Campbell Edwards, Elive Likine, Ernest Rimer, Jonathan Holland, Brett Hayes","Introduction/Purpose: Return to play (RTP) assessment and decision-making protocols are among the most discussed topics in sports medicine. Given the lack of validated guidelines, physicians and rehabilitation practitioners often rely on subjective functional evaluation to guide decisions to RTP. Biomechanical assessment using motion capture may be a useful strategy to evaluate an athlete’s post-injury functional status, and to estimate their ability to RTP with reduced risk of re-injury. The purpose of this case-study was to determine the efficacy of using marker-less 3D motion capture to provide an objective functional evaluation to tailor rehabilitation and aid RTP status for a patient who underwent syndesmotic fixation. Methods: In this case-study, a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate football offensive lineman (Height: 1.96 m, Weight: 141 kg) performed a movement screen 5 weeks after left ankle syndesmotic fixation for purely ligamentous syndesmotic injury. Testing was performed at the anticipated time of RTP. After a standardized warm-up, the patient performed a series of 14 movements consisting of upper and lower extremity actions in all three planes of motion, including bilateral and unilateral lower extremity actions. Kinematic data was captured using an 8-camera marker-less motion capture system (MLMCS). Left and right joint-specific ranges of motion were compared for symmetry and to normative data produced by the MLMCS manufacturer. Results: The participant successfully performed all 14 movements without limitation. Ankle flexion was symmetrical during bilateral and unilateral squatting actions. However, left ankle (i.e., involved side) flexion was consistently less than right ankle flexion during more dynamic actions (Table 1). Despite the asymmetries, ankle range of motion was within normal ranges for both sides in all movements. From a performance standpoint, left-side jump heights were consistently less than the right-side efforts during the unilateral countermovement jump (left: 34.5 cm versus right: 41.1 cm; -16.0%) and consecutive hops (left: 29.5 cm versus right: 33.0 cm; -10.8%). Results were shared with the athletic trainer to focus rehabilitation efforts. The patient was able to fully RTP at 6 weeks. Conclusion: In this case-study, the patient successfully performed a movement screen without limitation at the time of RTP after left ankle syndesmotic fixation. A MLMCS detected kinematic differences that would be difficult to qualitatively recognize. Specifically, the patient expressed reduced ankle flexion and jumping performance on the operative side. No baseline screening was performed, but the observed asymmetries were consistent with what would be expected from the specific injury. Further research is needed to compare baseline measures to kinematic changes. These findings suggest that a basic movement screen using MLMCS can detect kinematic asymmetries after syndesmotic fixation. Table 1. Kinematic Assessment of Ankle Range of Motion",1
Patient recovery after Lisfranc injury,2024-03-31,2024,Romanian Association of Balneology,Balneo and PRM Research Journal,"Cezar Mucileanu, Andrei Agapi, Marius Turnea, Mariana Rotariu, Iustina Condurache","Abstract: Lisfranc joint injuries occur most frequently following road accidents, but also in military personnel, athletes, horse riders, football players and contact sports participants. Lisfranc injuries occur as a result of direct (crushing the leg by a blunt object) or indirect (twisting the leg) forces acting on the forefoot. Approximately 20% of Lisfranc injuries go unnoticed or are diagnosed late, especially low-energy injuries or purely ligamentous injuries. Severe sequelae such as post-traumatic osteoarthritis and foot deformities can create serious disability. The paper presents a 19-year-old male patient, diagnosed with a Lisfranc type lesion in the left leg. The patient was functionally assessed postoperatively, during and at the end of the recovery program. During the recovery program, a good progress and evolution of the patient could be observed. Thus, the patient followed the kinetic program initially established by the physical therapist, and it was also possible to observe the increase in joint mobility, stability and muscle strength. The physical therapy program designed must be preceded by an appropriate assessment and must include techniques adapted to the patient's abilities. An essential condition is a good collaboration between the patient-physiotherapist-orthopedic surgeon, so that complications and relapses can be avoided.",1

This study aimed to establish a mouse inflammatory and degenerative patellar tendon injury model, which will facilitate research on patellar tendinopathy using advanced molecular tools including transgenic models. Collagenase at different doses (low dose (LD), medium dose (MD), high dose (HD)) or saline was injected over the mouse patellar tendon. At weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 post-injection, the tendons were harvested for histology and further examined by micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging at week 8. The optimal dose group and the saline group were further evaluated by immunohistochemical staining, gait pattern, and biomechanical properties. The histopathological score increased dose-dependently post-collagenase injection. Ectopic mineralization was observed and increased with collagenase dose. The LD group was selected for further analysis. The expression of IL-10, TNF-α, and MMP-1 significantly increased post-injection. The changes of limb idleness index (ΔLII) compared to preinjury state were significantly higher, while the ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate stress, and maximum Young’s modulus were significantly lower in the LD group compared to the saline group. A mouse inflammatory degenerative model of patellar tendon injury resembling tendinopathy was established as indicated by the dose-dependent increase in tendon histopathology, ectopic calcification, decrease in biomechanical properties, and pain-associated gait changes.",1

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between lower limb absolute and relative strength, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, and Global Positioning System (GPS) recorded 20m acceleration sprint velocity in elite male U-20 Gaelic football athletes. Nineteen athletes (19.0 ± 0.5 years; 81.1 ± 5.5 kg; 182 ± 6.2 cm) from the same elite U-20 squad participated in this study during an in-season period. Subjects performed a &gt;95% 1RM box squat, a 20m sprint test, and a CMJ test.

The Sprint Mechanics Assessment Score: A Qualitative Screening Tool for the In-field Assessment of Sprint Running Mechanics,2024-03-28,2024,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Christopher Bramah, Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo, Samantha Rhodes, Joshua D. Elliott, Thomas Dos’Santos","Background: Qualitative movement screening tools provide a practical method of assessing mechanical patterns associated with potential injury development. Biomechanics play a role in hamstring strain injury and are recommended as a consideration within injury screening and rehabilitation programs. However, no methods are available for the in-field assessment of sprint running mechanics associated with hamstring strain injuries. Purpose: To investigate the intra- and interrater reliability of a novel screening tool assessing in-field sprint running mechanics titled the Sprint Mechanics Assessment Score (S-MAS) and present normative S-MAS data to facilitate the interpretation of performance standards for future assessment uses. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Maximal sprint running trials (35 m) were recorded from 136 elite soccer players using a slow-motion camera. All videos were scored using the S-MAS by a single assessor. Videos from 36 players (18 men and 18 women) were rated by 2 independent assessors blinded to each other's results to establish interrater reliability. One assessor scored all videos in a randomized order 1 week later to establish intrarater reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) based on single measures using a 2-way mixed-effects model, with absolute agreement with 95% CI and kappa coefficients with percentage agreements, were used to assess the reliability of the overall score and individual score items, respectively. T-scores were calculated from the means and standard deviations of the male and female groups to present normative data values. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to assess between-sex differences and between-limb differences, respectively. Results: The S-MAS showed good intrarater (ICC, 0.828 [95% CI, 0.688-0.908]) and interrater (ICC, 0.799 [95% CI, 0.642-0.892]) reliability, with a standard error of measurement of 1 point. Kappa coefficients for individual score items demonstrated moderate to substantial intra- and interrater agreement for most parameters, with percentage agreements ranging from 75% to 88.8% for intrarater and 66.6% to 88.8% for interrater reliability. No significant sex differences were observed for overall scores, with mean values of 4.2 and 3.8 for men and women, respectively ( P = .27). Conclusion: The S-MAS is a new tool developed for assessing sprint running mechanics associated with lower limb injuries in male and female soccer players. The reliable and easy-to-use nature of the S-MAS means that this method can be integrated into practice, potentially aiding future injury screening and research looking to identify athletes who may demonstrate mechanical patterns potentially associated with hamstring strain injuries.",1

METHOD: External training load [duration, total distance [TD], high-speed running distance [HSRD], sprint distance [SpD], and acceleration- and deceleration distance [AccDecdist] from 100 female football players (22.3 ± 3.7 years of age) in the Norwegian premier division were collected over two seasons using STATSports APEX. This resulted in a final dataset totaling 10498 observations after multiple imputation of missing data. Microcycle length was categorized based on the number of days between matches (2 to 7 days apart), while training days were categorized relative to match day (MD, MD+1, MD+2, MD-5, MD-4, MD-3, MD-2, MD-1). Linear mixed modeling was used to assess differences between days, and starters vs. non-starters. RESULTS: In longer cycle lengths (5-7 days between matches), the middle of the week (usually MD-4 or MD-3) consistently exhibited the highest external training load (~21-79% of MD TD, MD HSRD, MD SpD, and MD AccDecdist); though, with the exception of duration (~108-120% of MD duration), it remained lower than MD. External training load was lowest on MD+2 and MD-1 (~1-37% of MD TD, MD HSRD, MD SpD, MD AccDecdist, and ~73-88% of MD peak speed). Non-starters displayed higher loads (~137-400% of starter TD, HSRD, SpD, AccDecdist) on MD+2 in cycles with 3 to 7 days between matches, with non-significant differences (~76-116%) on other training days. CONCLUSION: Loading patterns resemble a pyramid or skewed pyramid during longer cycle lengths (5-7 days), with higher training loads towards the middle compared to the start and the end of the cycle. Non-starters displayed slightly higher loads on MD+2, with no significant load differentiation from MD-5 onwards.",1
Foot posture index and hip joint rotation mobility in handball and soccer players,2024-03-28,2024,Science and Research Centre Koper,Annales Kinesiologiae,"Tjaž Brezovar, Matej Drobnič, Alan Kacin","Purpose: To assess the foot posture and hip joint mobility of elite handball and soccer players and to investigate possible correlations between these measurements. Methods: We compared the differences in means of Foot Posture Index (FPI), passive hip internal (IR), and external (ER) rotation range of motion (ROM) between three groups of male subjects (17 handball players, 17 soccer players, and 16 non-athletes). The Kruskal-Walli’s test and post-hoc pairwise comparison with the Mann-Whitney U test were used to determine the differences between the group means, and associations between variables were analyzed with Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Results: No significant differences in the mean FPI were found between the soccer players (1.3 ± 2.9), handball players (0.7 ± 2.1), and the control group (1.7 ± 2.5) (p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, no significant difference was found between the groups in the hip ER ROM. In contrast, a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) hip IR ROM was observed in the soccer players (30.6° ± 5.3°) compared to the handball players (41.0° ± 8.1°) and the control group (41.1° ± 6.4°). A weak positive correlation was only observed between the FPI and hip IR ROM in the soccer players (ρ: 0.36, p = 0.035). Conclusions: Handball and soccer players show a tendency toward less pronated feet compared to non-athletes, but the differences are not significant and the mean FPI values are still within the range of normal foot posture. The range of hip IR seems to be reduced in soccer players and weakly, but significantly and positively associated with the FPI value, which needs to be further investigated in future studies.",1
Immediate Effect of a Kinesiotape Bandage on Knee Mechanics during Functional Tests in Female Rugby and Football Athletes: A Pilot Study,2024-03-28,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Amandine Fevre, Juliette Moriceau, Jaime Almazán-Polo, Guillermo García-Pérez-de-Sevilla","Background: Some bandages with Kinesiotape have demonstrated some potential as means of prevention for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury in men. Objective: The main objective of this pilot study was to observe if a Kinesiotape bandage at the knee could potentially have an immediate preventive effect against ACL injuries by improving proprioception and balance and reducing knee valgus and anterior translation of the tibia during certain functional tests in female athletes. Materials and Methods: A cross-over clinical trial including 10 female athletes (football and rugby) was conducted, where the two lower limbs of the 10 participants (n = 20) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or to the control group (CG). A Kinesiotape bandage was placed on one knee with a tension of 75% (IG, n = 10) and another bandage on the other knee with a tension of 10% (CG, n = 10), as a placebo. Ultrasound assessment and functional tests were performed before (T1) and after (T2) bandaging according to group assignment. A videographic analysis was carried out with the ImageJ Software version 2.0. Results: A statistically significant reduction in knee valgus was observed in the Lateral Step Down test in the IG, compared to the CG (p &lt; 0.05; η2p = 0.26) (IG-T1: 151.40 ± 11.04°; IG-T2: 157.10 ± 10.18°; versus CG-T1: 156.96 ± 5.44°; CG-T2: 158.68 ± 6.12°). In the other tests, no significant differences were found in terms of time × group interaction. Conclusions: A Kinesiotape bandage was able to reduce knee valgus in a functional test compared to a placebo bandage but was not more effective at reducing the anterior translation of the tibia or improving balance or proprioception. Based on these results, it could have a modest preventive effect against an ACL injury in female athletes.",1
ANATOMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THIGH PARAMETERS THE STUDENTS OF BUKOVYNA,2024-03-28,2024,Ivano-Frankivsk National Medical University,Art of Medicine,S.Yu. Karatieieva,"It is known that the factor that determines success in sports is the morphological features of the structure of the human body. In order to establish the anatomical characteristics of the thigh parameters of students of Bukovyna who play football and handball, followed by modeling for sports selection, a study was conducted of students of higher educational institutions of Bukovyna (n=129), of which young boys - n=69 and young girls - n=60. The subjects were divided into a main group - 89 students who improved by playing football and handball and a control group - 40 students who did not do the sports. Students of the main group, in addition to the physical activity that was included in the program of their specialty during the year, additionally attended sports sections in football and handball during the year. Medium-intensity training took place under the control of a trainer, the frequency of training was 3.43 ± 1.26 days/week (90 minutes each). Students of the control group did not do the sports. The initial survey was conducted in 2021 year, and the same students were resurveyed in 2022 year. All subjects were subjected to an anthropometric study, according to the method of P.P. Shaparenka (thigh circumference in the upper third, in the middle third and in the lower third, body weight, height). So, it was found that when comparing the first and second measurement, the thigh circumference indicators at the second measurement (in dynamics after one year) were slightly higher in students who play football (young boys and young girls) in the upper, middle and lower thirds than in students who play handball (for students who play football ±3.43 cm, for students who play handball ±2.12 cm). The model for predicting the circumference of the thigh in the upper third on the right: Cpr=β1 + β2 + 0.493w – 0.135h, where Cpr is the circumference of the thigh in the upper third (right), w is body weight, h is height, β1= (49.735 for girls and 44.489 for young men), β2= (–1.391 for the soccer group; –2.321 for the handball group), on the left: Cpl=β1 + β2 + 0.465w, where Cpl is the circumference of the thigh in the upper third (left), w is body weight, β1= ( 25.736 for girls and 20.147 for boys), β2= (–1.333 for the football group; –0.515 for the handball group). The model for predicting the circumference of the thigh in the middle of the right: Cmr=β1 + β2 + 0.460w – 0.183h, where Cmr is the circumference of the thigh in the middle of the right, w is body weight, h is height; β1= (52.567 for young girls and 48.930 for young boys), β2= (–2.235 for the football group; –1.968 for the handball group); on the left: Cml=β1 + β2 + 0.449w, where Cml is the thigh circumference in the middle of the left, w is body weight; β1= (20.716 for young girls and 20.943 for young boys), β2= (– 0.254 for the football group; –1.405 for the handball group). The model for predicting the circumference of the thigh in the lower third of the right: Cdr=β1 + β2 + 0.418w, where Cdr is the circumference of the thigh in the lower third of the right, w is body weight, β1= (25.560 for young girls and 20.165 for young boys), β2= (– 0.039 for the football group; 0.061 for the handball group); on the left: Cdl=β1 + β2 + 0.387w, where Cdl is the thigh circumference in the lower third on the left, w is body weight; β1= (24.638 for young girls and 18.523 for young boys), β2= (– 0.379 for the football group; –0.261 for the handball group). So, it is established that for significant predictors for predicting thigh circumference on the right in the upper and middle third are gender, sport, height and body weight, in the lower third are gender, sport and body weight, on the left are gender, sport and body weight.",1

Psychological aspects associated with ACL rehabilitation and recurrence in football players: a systematic review,2024-03-27,2024,JURUFRA SL,Retos,"Luis Miguel Ramos Pastrana, José María Giménez Egido, Aurelio Olmedilla Zafra","Although most football players recover good physical function after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, some do not return to their sport or to the same pre-injury level, and there is a risk of recurrence. Therefore, this study aimed to examine research on psychological aspects of ACL rehabilitation and Return to Play (RTP), as well as their influence on possible recurrence in football and futsal players. The search was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, WoS, CENTRAL databases, and grey literature sources DART-Europe and OpenGrey. A total of nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated as the most evaluated psychological factor the psychological readiness to RTP through the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI). Likewise, psychological interventions in ACL-injured football players have positive effects on mood states, reduces pain perception, and fear reinjury, among others. Risk profiles for recurrence included vulnerability to stress and high psychological readiness to RTP. Therefore, psychological interventions should be incorporated into the rehabilitation process and screening to identify players at risk for poor outcomes or recurrences. Additional research would help to understand the influence of other variables or optimal levels of psychological readiness to RTP.

The importance of core strength for change of direction speed,2024-03-26,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Henrieta Horníková, Erika Zemková","Change of direction speed (CODS) is determined by several physical aspects, such as linear sprint speed, reactive strength and power of leg muscles. It appears that core strength may also play a role in CODS, however, its relationship to CODS remains unclear. The aim of this narrative review was to analyze the literature addressing a) the relationship between core strength and CODS and b) the effect of core strength training on CODS. This analysis revealed a significant relationship between the parameters of core strength and stability (the pressure of the activated core muscles during lower limb movement and the greatest mean force output of maximum volunteered contraction) and the time in the Agility T-Test. However, this parameter was not significantly related to the strength endurance of core muscles (total time in the plank test). Core training provides a sufficient stimulus for the development of CODS in less-skilled middle-adolescent athletes, while its effectiveness decreases in higher-skilled adult athletes. These findings indicate that core muscle strength contributes significantly to the change of direction speed. Core training is therefore useful for improving CODS.",1
Starters vs. non-starters differences in vertical jump force-time metrics in female professional volleyball players,2024-03-25,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Damjana V. Cabarkapa, Dimitrije Cabarkapa, Andrew C. Fry","As one of the fundamental volleyball skills, countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) has been commonly implemented in the applied sports setting as a non-invasive and time-efficient assessment of athletes' lower-body neuromuscular function. The purpose of the present study was to examine the differences in CMJ characteristics between starters and non-starters within a cohort of professional female volleyball players. Nineteen athletes competing in one of the top European leagues (i.e., SuperLeague) volunteered to participate in the present investigation. Following the completion of a warm-up protocol, each athlete performed three maximal-effort CMJs with no arm swing while standing on a uni-axial force plate system sampling at 1,000 Hz. The following force-time metrics were used for performance analysis purposes: braking phase duration and impulse, eccentric and concentric duration, mean and peak force and power, contraction time, jump height, and reactive strength index-modified. Mann–Whitney U and independent t -tests revealed no statistically significant differences ( p &amp;gt; 0.05) during both eccentric and concentric phases of CMJ between the players included in the starting lineup ( n = 9) and their substitutions ( n = 10), with the effect sizes being small to moderate in magnitude ( g = 0.053–0.683). While further research is warranted on this topic, these results suggest that securing a position in a starting lineup at the professional level of volleyball play may be more contingent on the player's ability to proficiently execute sport-specific skills (e.g., blocking, attacking), rather than the performance on the CMJ assessment, considering that the observed values for both groups fall within the desired ranges for this specific population of athletes.",1

The impact of intrinsic foot muscle strengthening exercises in asymptomatic athletes with normal foot structure: A systematic review,2024-03-23,2024,Elsevier BV,Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,"Maha Ahmed, Saima Zaki, Md Farhan Alam, Saurabh Sharma, Abdulaziz Ali Al Salman, Ali Altaweel, Nazar Alkhadrawi, Shibili Nuhmani, Humaira Khan","PurposeThe intrinsic foot muscles (IFM) are crucial to the passive, active, and neurological subsystems that compose the foot core, and their weakness may predispose to various foot pathologies, systemic diseases and musculoskeletal conditions. Strengthening of IFM is an effective intervention in clinical conditions, but its role in sports and clinical rehabilitation is still inconclusive. Thus, this review aims to evaluate the effects of IFM strengthening exercises in athletes with normal feet.MethodsAn electronic database search was conducted using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for assessing bias in the included studies.ResultsFour studies were included for qualitative review. The meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of measuring units of outcome measures in the included studies. All the studies showed an improvement in intrinsic foot muscle strength, though the training protocols used by them were only roughly equivalent. One study reported no significant differences in MLA stiffness after 8 weeks of intervention. The clinician assessed motor performance and morphological assessments showed considerable improvements. Improved vertical running propulsive forces were reported, though the running economy showed no changes.ConclusionFindings suggest that IFM exercises effectively improve outcomes such as foot morphology and function, strength, running mechanics and subjective function in athletes and may be incorporated in sports rehabilitation. These conclusions should be considered with caution due to bias in included studies.",1
Association between Sprint and Jump Performance and Maximum Strength in Standing Calf Raise or Squat in Elite Youth Soccer Players,2024-03-22,2024,MDPI AG,Sports,"Björn Kadlubowski, Michael Keiner, Klaus Wirth, Robert Csapo","Soccer is a complex sports discipline that requires players to engage in diverse high-intensity and multidirectional activities. The optimization of strength and conditioning programs requires a comprehensive understanding of the physical attributes influencing player performance. While previous research has demonstrated the influence of knee and hip extensor muscles on the performance in sprints and other explosive movements, this study aimed to establish the relationship between plantar flexor muscle strength and high-intensity actions. Back squat (BS) and calf raise (CR) one-repetition maxima as well as linear sprint (5-, 10-, 30 m) and drop jump performance from different heights (15, 30, 45 and 60 cm) were measured in 45 elite youth players (age: 16.62 ± 1.1 years). Results showed significant negative correlations between BS strength and sprint times (r = −0.60 to −0.61), confirming the importance of lower limb extensor muscle strength in short-distance sprints. While no significant correlations were found with sprint performances, CR strength was significantly associated with drop jump test results from 45 and 60 cm drop height (r = 0.36 to 0.46). These findings demonstrate that isolated CR strength positively influences the performance in actions involving rapid stretch-shortening cycles, which suggests that current strength and conditioning programs for youth soccer players should be extended to also include exercises specifically targeting the plantar flexor muscles. While this cross-sectional study provides novel insights into the complex interplay between muscle strength and soccer-specific performance, its findings need to be corroborated in longitudinal studies directly testing the impact of plantar flexor strength training.",1
A survey into the current fitness testing practices of elite male soccer practitioners: from assessment to communicating results,2024-03-19,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Nikolaos D. Asimakidis, Chris J. Bishop, Marco Beato, Irvin N. Mukandi, Adam L. Kelly, Anthony Weldon, Anthony N. Turner","This study provides insight into the current fitness testing practices in elite male soccer. One hundred and two practitioners from professional soccer leagues across 24 countries completed an online survey comprising 29 questions, with five sections: a) background information, b) testing selection, c) testing implementation, d) data analysis, and e) data reporting. Frequency analysis was used to evaluate the responses to fixed response questions and thematic analysis was used for open-ended questions to generate clear and distinct themes. Strength (85%) and aerobic capacity (82%) represent the most frequently assessed physical qualities. Scientific literature (80%) is the most influential factor in testing selection and practitioners conduct fitness testing less frequently than their perceived ideal frequency per season (3.6 ± 2 vs. 4.5 ± 2). Time and competitive schedule were the greatest barriers to fitness testing administration. Practitioners mostly used a ‘hybrid’ approach (45%) to fitness testing, blending ‘traditional’ (i.e., a day dedicated to testing) and ‘integrated’ (i.e., testing within regular training sessions) methods. Microsoft Excel is the most used software for data analysis (95%) and visualization (79%). An equal use of the combination of best and mean scores of multiple trials (44%) and the best score (42%) was reported. Comparing a player’s test performance with previous scores (89%) was the most common method for interpreting test results. However, only 38% considered measurement error. Digital displays and verbal feedback are the most common data reporting methods, with different data reporting processes for coaches and players. Practitioners can use data and findings from this study to inform their current testing practices and researchers to further identify areas for investigation, with the overarching aim of developing the field of fitness testing in elite male soccer.",1
Reliable electrocortical dynamics of target-directed pass-kicks,2024-03-16,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Cognitive Neurodynamics,"Daghan Piskin, Daniel Büchel, Tim Lehmann, Jochen Baumeister","Football is one of the most played sports in the world and kicking with adequate accuracy increases the likelihood of winning a competition. Although studies with different target-directed movements underline the role of distinctive cortical activity on superior accuracy, little is known about cortical dynamics associated with kicking. Mobile electroencephalography is a popular tool to investigate cortical modulations during movement, however, inherent and artefact-related pitfalls may obscure the reliability of functional sources and their activity. The purpose of this study was therefore to describe consistent cortical dynamics underlying target-directed pass-kicks based on test-retest reliability estimates. Eleven participants performed a target-directed kicking task at two different sessions within one week. Electroencephalography was recorded using a 65-channel mobile system and behavioural data were collected including motion range, acceleration and accuracy performance. Functional sources were identified using independent component analysis and clustered in two steps with the components of first and subsequently both sessions. Reliability estimates of event-related spectral perturbations were computed pixel-wise for participants contributing with components of both sessions. The parieto-occipital and frontal clusters were reproducible for the same majority of the sample at both sessions. Their activity showed consistent alpha desyhronization and theta sychnronisation patterns with substantial reliability estimates revealing visual and attentional demands in different phases of kicking. The findings of our study reveal prominent cortical demands during the execution of a target-directed kick which may be considered in practical implementations and provide promising academic prospects in the comprehension and investigation of cortical activity associated with target-directed movements.",1
A 2D video-based assessment is associated with 3D biomechanical contributors to dynamic knee valgus in the coronal plane,2024-03-15,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Ashley Erdman, Alex Loewen, Michael Dressing, Charles Wyatt, Gretchen Oliver, Lauren Butler, Dai Sugimoto, Amanda M. Black, Kirsten Tulchin-Francis, David M. Bazett-Jones, Joseph Janosky, Sophia Ulman","Introduction Adolescent athletes involved in sports that involve cutting and landing maneuvers have an increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, highlighting the importance of identifying risky movement patterns such as dynamic knee valgus (DKV). Qualitative movement screenings have explored two-dimensional (2D) scoring criteria for DKV, however, there remains limited data on the validity of these screening tools. Determining a 2D scoring criterion for DKV that closely aligns with three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical measures will allow for the identification of poor knee position in adolescent athletes on a broad scale. The purpose of this study was to establish a 2D scoring criterion that corresponds to 3D biomechanical measures of DKV. Methods A total of 41 adolescent female club volleyball athletes performed a three-task movement screen consisting of a single-leg squat (SLS), single-leg drop landing (SLDL), and double-leg vertical jump (DLVJ). A single rater scored 2D videos of each task using four criteria for poor knee position. A motion capture system was used to calculate 3D joint angles, including pelvic obliquity, hip adduction, knee abduction, ankle eversion, and foot progression angle. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created for each 2D scoring criterion to determine cut points for the presence of movement faults, and areas under the curve (AUC) were computed to describe the accuracy of each 2D criterion compared to 3D biomechanical data. Results 3D measures indicated knee abduction angles between 2.4°–4.6° (SD 4.1°–4.3°) at the time point when the center of the knee joint was most medial during the three tasks. AUCs were between 0.62 and 0.93 across scoring items. The MEDIAL scoring item, defined as the knee joint positioned inside the medial border of the shoe, demonstrated the greatest association to components of DKV, with AUCs ranging from 0.67 to 0.93. Conclusion The MEDIAL scoring criterion demonstrated the best performance in distinguishing components of DKV, specifically pelvic obliquity, hip adduction, ankle eversion, and foot progression. Along with the previously published scoring definitions for trunk-specific risk factors, the authors suggest that the MEDIAL criterion may be the most indicative of DKV, given an association with 3D biomechanical risk factors.",1

This study seeks to bridge the gap by integrating real-time human motion with biomechanical software to enhance the ergonomics of archers. Thirteen participants were involved in four tasks, using different bows with varied draw weights and shooting distances. Through the application of advanced integrative technology, this study highlights the distinct postures adopted by both males and females, which indicate the biomechanical differences between genders. Additionally, an analysis of the correlation between exposed spinal forces and these adopted postures provides insights into injury risk assessment during the key archery movements. The findings of this study have the potential to significantly enhance the application of training methodologies and the design of assistive devices. These improvements are geared towards mitigating injury risks and enhancing the overall performance of archers.",1

Nineteen female football players randomly served as either experimental ( n = 9) or control groups ( n = 10). The players were tested for physical fitness tests: linear sprint speed including both short and long distances (5- and 10-m sprints without a ball and 20- and 30-m sprints with and without dribbling), COD speed (arrowhead agility test with and without dribbling a ball, Southeast Missouri [SEMO] agility test, and 22-m repeated slalom dribbling test), and reactive agility. Significant group × time interactions were observed for sprint over long distances and COD speed but not for short sprint and reactive agility performances. Paired t-tests revealed considerable improvements in all performances from the pre-test to post-test for the SAQ group, except for the arrowhead agility (left; p = .07). The control group only exhibited significant improvements in 10-m sprint performance after general football training. Eight weeks of SAQ training were effective at enhancing acceleration, maximum sprint speed, and agility performances amongst highly trained U-20 female football players.",1
Examining the association between speed and myoelectric activity: Time-based differences and muscle group balance,2024-03-13,2024,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Marco Porta, Cristoforo Filetti, Aldo Chiari, Italo Leo, Elvira Padua, Gianluca Briotti, Giuseppe Messina, Wassim Moalla, Bruno Ruscello","The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between speed and myoelectric activity, measured during an incremental 25m shuttle running test, exploring the time-based variations and assessing muscle group balance within the context of this association. Twelve male young soccer players (n = 12) aged 18±1.2 years, with an average body mass of 68.4±5.8kg and average body height of 1.72±0.08m, from a professional Italian youth team (Italian “Primavera”), volunteered as participants for this study. The speed of each player during testing was measured using GPS technology, sampling at 50Hz. Myoelectrical activities of the gluteus, hamstrings, and quadriceps muscles were recorded through wearable sEMG devices, sampled at 100Hz. To ensure alignment of the sampling frequencies, the sEMG data was resampled to 50Hz, matching the GPS data sampling rate. This allowed for direct comparison and analysis of the data obtained from both measurement systems. The collected data were then analyzed to determine the relationship between the investigated variables and any potential differences associated with different sides of the body. The results revealed a robust correlation (r 2 ≈0.97) between the speed of the participants (m·s -1 ) and their myoelectrical activity (μV) during the test. Factorial ANOVA 2x11 showed no significant differences between the sides of the analyzed muscles (p&gt;0.05). The interpolation lines generated by the association of speed and sEMG exhibit very similar angular coefficients (0.9 to 0.12) in all six measurements obtained from electromyography of the three investigated muscle groups on each side of the body. In conclusion, the concurrent validity between the two instruments in this study indicates that GPS and sEMG are valid and consistent in estimating external load and internal load during incremental shuttle running.",1

It was hypothesised that anteromedial injuries would be more common than posteromedial lesions. Methods One hundred and twenty subjects aged 18–25 years with a primary ACL injury were included. Patients were excluded if the time between injury and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was more than 28 days or if a knee dislocation or fracture was present. The MRIs were analysed with particular emphasis on injuries to the medial knee structures, menisci and bone bruise patterns. Injuries to the ligaments and anteromedial retinaculum (AMR) were graded according to severity, ranging from periligamentous oedema (grade I), partial fibre disruption of less or more than 50% (grade IIa or IIb) to complete tears (grade III). Results AMR injury was seen in 87 subjects (72.5%) on the coronal plane and in 88 (73.3%) on the axial plane, with grade III lesions observed in 27 (22.5%) and 29 knees (24.2%). Injuries to the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), deep MCL (dMCL) and posterior oblique ligament (POL) were detected in 60 patients (50%), 93 patients (77.5%) and 38 patients (31.6%). However, grade III injuries to the POL were observed in only seven knees (5.8%). Medial meniscus injuries were associated with lesions of the sMCL and AMR ( p &lt; 0.05), while lateral meniscus injuries were significantly more common in patients with dMCL rupture ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Data from this study suggest that injuries to the AMR are much more common than posteromedial lesions in subjects with ACL injuries. Level of Evidence Level IV.",1
Knee Biomechanics During Cutting Maneuvers and Secondary ACL Injury Risk: A Prospective Cohort Study of Knee Biomechanics in 756 Female Elite Handball and Soccer Players,2024-03-08,2024,SAGE Publications,The American Journal of Sports Medicine,"Lasse Mausehund, Tron Krosshaug","Background: An athlete who returns to sport after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury has a substantially high risk of sustaining a new secondary ACL injury. Because ACL injuries most frequently occur during cutting maneuvers, such movements should be at the center of research attention. Purpose: To investigate whether knee biomechanical parameters during side-step cutting maneuvers differ between female elite athletes with and without a history of ACL injury and to evaluate whether such parameters are associated with future secondary ACL injury. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 756 female elite handball and soccer players, of whom 76 had a history of ACL injury, performed a sport-specific cutting task while 3-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were measured. ACL injuries were registered prospectively over an 8-year follow-up period. Seven knee-specific biomechanical variables were the basis for all analyses. Two-way analyses of variance were applied to assess group differences, whereas logistic regression models served to evaluate associations between the knee-specific variables and future secondary ACL injury. Results: When players with a previous ACL injury performed the cutting maneuver with their ipsilateral leg, they exhibited lower knee abduction angles (mean difference [MD], 1.4°-1.5°; 95% CI, 0.2°-2.9°), lower peak knee flexion moments (MD, 0.33 N·m/kg -1 ; 95% CI, 0.18-0.48 N·m/kg -1 ), lower peak knee abduction moments (MD, 0.27 N·m/kg -1 ; 95% CI, 0.12-0.41 N·m/kg -1 ), and lower peak knee internal rotation moments (MD, 0.06 N·m/kg -1 ; 95% CI, 0.01-0.12 N·m/kg -1 ) compared with injury-free players. When players performed the cut with their contralateral leg, no differences were evident ( P &lt; .05). None of the 7 knee-specific biomechanical variables was associated with future secondary ACL injury in players with an ACL injury history ( P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Approximately 4 years after ACL injury, female elite team-ball athletes still unloaded their ipsilateral knee during cutting maneuvers, yet contralateral knee loading was similar to that of injury-free players. Knee biomechanical characteristics were not associated with future secondary ACL injury.",1

The Effect of Two-Handed Overhead Medicine Ball Throwing Exercises on Upper Extreme Muscle Strength and Kinematic Movement in Soccer Throw-ins,2024-03-07,2024,JURUFRA SL,Retos,"Imam Syafii, Nining Widyah Kusnanik, I Dewa Made Aryananda Wijaya Kusuma, Yanyong Phanpheng, Arif Bulqini, David Agus Prianto","This study aims to analyze the effect of two-handed overhead medicine ball (THOMBT) training on upper extremity muscle strength and kinematic movement. This research utilized an experimental method with a pre-test and post-test design. Sample collection used a random sampling technique. The sampling results were then divided into a control group (CTRL) and an experimental group (THOMBT). The Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene's test were used as prerequisite tests. Paired t-tests and independent sample t-tests were used to compare improvements within and between groups. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Cohen's effect size (ES) was used to measure group differences. A total of 15 players were in the experimental group with an average age of 16.20 ± 0.77 years, while 15 other players were in the control group with an average age of 16.13 ± 0.83. Before and after the four-week trial period, upper extremity muscle strength testing was conducted using push-ups, sit-ups, and kinematic movement tests, which included throwing distance, arm angular speed, and release angle tests. The result is the THOMBT group showed significant improvements in push-ups (p = .000, Δ% = 22.44), sit-ups (p = .000, Δ% = 9.33), distance throws (p = .000, Δ% = 8.20), and arm angular velocity (p = .000, Δ% = 14.98). Meanwhile, the CTRL group did not have a significant increase. The conclusion is that THOMBT training for four weeks is effective in increasing upper extremity strength ability and movement kinematics, but not variable angle of release.

Return-to-play decision-making following ankle injury: a comprehensive case analysis of the functional hop test,2024-03-06,2024,Open Exploration Publishing,Exploration of Musculoskeletal Diseases,"Michael Crinion, Andrew Ball, Michael Agnone","Following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of the knee, the functional hop test (an averaging of 4 component hop tests including single-hop, triple-hop, cross-over-hop, and 6-meter-hop) is commonly used by sports medicine physicians, doctors of physical therapy, and athletic trainers in return-to-practice and return-to-play decision making. In this case report, the functional hop test was applied to a 31-year-old recreational basketball player status-post full-tear of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) to examine the applicability of a standardized, efficient, and easy-to-administer functional test in making return-to-play decisions following an ankle injury. The functional hop test was administered 5 times across a treatment course of 11 physical therapy sessions emphasizing pain-free range of motion, baseline strength, weight-bearing loading, and sport-specific training. The functional hop test was found to be a helpful (albeit imperfect) tool for clinical decision-making following an ankle injury. Specifically, improvements in landing skill/confidence of single hop accounted for the greatest gains in total score in the early phase of rehabilitation, while momentum and plyometric skill/control of triple hop accounted for the greatest gains in total score in the later phase of rehabilitation. Modification of the functional hop test to include sub-component tests of strength, endurance, and/or lateral hops are discussed.",1

Contemporary ACL reconstruction techniques have recently been subject to renewed interest in this population. The objective of this study is to report the short- and mid-term results of our physis-sparing ACL reconstruction technique using an ""over the top"" technique associated with a modified Lemaire procedure. (2) Methods: A retrospective series of 12 junior soccer players who presented to our clinic with a torn ACL between January 2019 and September 2021 was reviewed. The inclusion criteria were patients under 15 years with open tibial and femoral physes, with a stable contralateral knee, a minimum follow-up of 6 months, and a time frame from injury to surgery of <3 months. Patients with previous knee surgery, structural concomitant injuries, muscular, neurological, or vascular abnormalities, or hypersensitivity to metal alloys were excluded. The functional evaluation was performed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level. Moreover, clinical and radiological assessments were also performed, including KT-1000 and knee X-rays. (3) Results: We identified 1 female and 11 male patients with ACL tears, with a mean age of 13.17 ± 0.9 months. Concomitant injuries include isolated vertical and bucket-handle tears of the medial meniscus, lateral meniscus tears, bilateral tear of both menisci. The mean follow-up time was 26 ± 12.6 months. The average IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scores were 93.29 ± 11.04, 95.08 ± 13.2 and 9 ± 0.0 points, respectively. The average KT-1000 score of the participants was 0.96 ± 1.6 points. None of the included patients reported post-surgical complications or required additional surgeries.

Effect of maturation level on normative specific-agility performance metrics and their fitness predictors in soccer players aged 11–18 years,2024-03-04,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Mohamed Sellami, Emna Makni, Wassim Moalla, Raghad Tarwneh, Mohamed Elloumi","Abstract Background In sports sciences, normative data serve as standards for specific physical performance attributes, enhancing talent identification within a specific population. The aim of this study was to provide standard data for Agility-15 m, Ball-15 m tests, and skill index, considering maturation level, specifically age at peak height velocity (PHV). The study also investigated the relationship between relative performances in these tests and anthropometrics, jumping (squat jump [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ]), and sprinting abilities (S-5 m, S-10 m, S-20 m, S-30 m) in young soccer players. Methods The study involved 647 soccer players aged 11–18 years, categorized into three groups: pre-PHV, circum-PHV, and post-PHV. Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc testing to detect variations among maturation groups, and Pearson’s correlation test to examine the relationship between factors. Results Agility-15 m and ball-15 m performances among maturity groups showed significant differences ( p &lt; 0.01). Significant correlations were identified in pre-PHV group, between lower limb length and Agility-15 m ( r =-0.23, p &lt; 0.05) and between height and Ball-15 m ( r =-0.23, p &lt; 0.05). In post-PHV group, there was a correlation between body fat percentage (BF %) and Agility-15 m ( r = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05) and Ball-15 m ( r = 0.21, p &lt; 0.05). In all maturity groups, there were significant correlations between agility and sprint tests (S-5 m, S-10 m, S-20 m, and S-30 m) and muscle power (SJ and CMJ). Conclusion The study revealed that both speed and lower limb power significantly influence agility in young soccer players, providing valuable insights for coaches and practitioners to create tailored training plans and interventions for different age groups and maturity levels.",1
The Impact of Interaction between Body Posture and Movement Pattern Quality on Injuries in Amateur Athletes,2024-03-02,2024,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Dawid Koźlenia, Katarzyna Kochan-Jacheć","Background: this study aimed to examine the impact of interaction between body posture and the quality of movement patterns on injury frequencies in amateur athletes. Methods: The study sample consisted of 89 young amateur athletes. Movement pattern quality was assessed by the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), test and body posture in the frontal plane was assessed by the moire method for the parameters Shoulder Slope Angle, Lower Scapula Protrusion Difference, and Pelvic Tilt Angle. Injury data were collected through completion of the Injury History Questionnaire for the past 12 months. Results: Using cluster analysis, participants were allocated into a either category with good (BPg) body posture or poor (BPp), and using FMS cutoff points (14), either a category of good movement pattern quality (MPg) or poor (MPp). Two-way ANOVA was performed, and the Bonferroni post-hoc test revealed a reduction in injuries among participants from the MPg-BPg group compared to the other three groups (p < 0.05). However, no interaction between factors was revealed. No statistically significant differences were observed among the remaining three groups in the case of injury prevalence (p > 0.05). Conclusions: A combination of proper body posture and high-quality movement patterns is associated with a lower frequency of injuries, without direct interaction between chosen factors, which suggests that they impact injury risk independently. Practicing suitable BP and ensuring high-quality MPs should be regarded as a strategy in injury prevention.",1

Study Design Qualitative study Methods Nine semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with CAI-patients who were referred to an orthopedic setting. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using systematic text condensation with an inductive goal free approach. Results Seven themes emerged. The themes were Injury history and symptoms (Lateral ankle sprain during sport, pain and instability), Information from health professional (conflicting information about management and prognosis), Management (mental and physical challenges), Expectation and hope (explanation of symptoms, prognosis and imaging to provide clarification of condition), Activity and participation (restriction in sport and daily life and feelings of uncertainty), Support (support from family/friends) and Identity (low ability to participate in sport and social life result in loss of identity). Conclusion The impact of CAI exceeds an experience of pain and instability. Patients experienced loss of identity, having to manage uncertainty regarding their diagnosis and prognosis and had hopes of being able to explain their condition.",1
Youth handball concussion prevention strategies: a workshop-based study with experts and end users,2024-03-01,2024,BMJ,BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine,"Victor Sturesson, Peter Marforio, Arlind Reuter, Kajsa Johansson, Eva Ageberg","Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a serious injury in youth team sports, including handball. While research on the prevention of SRC has made progress over the past 5 years, prevention strategies are lacking in handball. The aim was to explore and develop strategies focusing on information, rules and training that may prevent concussion in youth handball by incorporating knowledge from experts and end users. Using a participatory methodology, experts (physiotherapy, biomechanics: n=3) and end users (players, coaches, referees, coach educators: n=7) contributed their experience and knowledge in a 2-hour online workshop. Participants were given three videos illustrating typical high-risk concussion scenarios from handball games and a youth player’s accompanying fictional written scenario. In group discussions inspired by the brainwriting method, participants were asked to provide ideas for possible SRC prevention strategies related to information, rules and/or training. Data were collected on a digital whiteboard and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Three themes were derived: (1) ‘Coaches’ responsibility: raise awareness of the risk of injury and act to promote safe environments’; (2) ‘Players’ responsibility: safe defence and attack’; and (3) ‘Improvement of personal skills’. Experts and end users found information about high-risk situations and SRC symptoms, stricter rules and safe playing strategy training for goalkeepers, attacking and defending players, respectively, may effectively reduce SRC in handball. Information and stricter rules could be delivered through education and dissemination activities, whereas safe playing strategies should be trained at regular handball practice.",1
588 BO23 – Virtual reality in return to sport screening after ACL reconstruction- just for fun or a serious game?,2024-03-01,2024,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine,Brief Oral Abstracts,"Evi Wezenbeek, Joke Schuermans, Glenn Van Wallendael, Erik Witvrouw","<h3>Background</h3> Recent research showed that currently accepted RTS criteria do not sufficiently identify patients at risk for an ACL reinjury. Interestingly, many of the sports where the ACL (re)injury is high, are characterized by sudden, sometimes unforeseen, changes in direction and constant attention to the environment is paramount. With the help of Virtual Reality (VR), sport-specific life-like situations can be created, shifting the athlete's focus to the VR game instead of the injured knee. Therefore, VR guided RTS screening could be more suited to detect residual functional kinematic deficits after ACLR. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the effect of VR on movement quality during RTS evaluation in male football players after ACLR compared to the healthy matched controls. <h3>Design</h3> A kinematic case-control study. <h3>Setting</h3> All participants performed a kinematic RTS testing in which cutting and header maneuvers were evaluated in both VR and non-VR guided settings. <h3>Patients</h3> Forty male football players were included (20 ACLR patients, 20 healthy matched controls). <h3>Assessment of risk factors</h3> The kinematic testing was conducted in a VR situation, where the participants wore a head mounted display and a non-VR situation, where Reaction Lights were used. <h3>Main outcome measurements</h3> Knee angles were calculated, with particular focus on the ground-contact phases during the cutting and landing tasks. <h3>Results</h3> The VR condition showed more flexion (average p = 0.044) and adduction (average p = 0.029; maximal p = 0.012) during the push-off phase of the side cutting maneuver. Also, only the VR condition was able to identify bilateral differences, sparing the affected leg during landing (p = 0.016). <h3>Conclusion</h3> The biomechanical risk profile for (re)injury was more provoked during VR screening, probably due to the external focus of attention through immersion. So, although still in its infancy, VR seems to be promising to incorporate for screening purposes.",1

However, the training approach will depend on football player; they may employ a variety of various methods to improve all aspects of their performance. So now, Practice in Mind (PIM) Training is a program that combines imagery and physical training which consists of seven PETTLEP components. Other than motivation, visual, and kinesthetic directions, the imagery material in the PIM training program includes the facilitative imagery direction and stimulus to react to the propositions. Hence to infer that imagery in sports performance is particularly effective in settings where practical restrictions impede physical training, such as biomechanical stiffness, weak physical strength, weariness, injury risk, and restricted access to equipment.

By combining multiple biomechanical variables, cluster analyses could help us identify safe and risky cutting technique strategies. <h3>Objective</h3> To identify cutting technique clusters and assess their association with ACL injury risk. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanical laboratory. <h3>Participants</h3> 786 female elite handball and football players, including players with and without a previous and future ACL injury. <h3>Interventions</h3> All participants performed a sport-specific cutting task while 3D biomechanics were recorded. ACL injuries were registered prospectively for 8 years. To identify different cutting techniques with distinct biomechanical features, we employed a K-means clustering algorithm on data subsets involving different numbers of kinematic variables and different sports. Adjusted rand indices (ARI) were used to assess the impact of the identified cutting technique clusters on ACL injury risk. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Kinematics of the identified cutting technique clusters and the clusters' association with ACL injury risk. <h3>Results</h3> We found no clearly distinguishable cutting technique clusters, as evidenced by average silhouette scores (ASS) of less than 0.5 (Table). There was some evidence of cluster existence in the subset involving both sports and five variables (ASS = 0.36), but these clusters were of no relevance for ACL injury risk (ARI = 0.00). Rather, they could be attributed to sport-related differences (ARI = 0.84) (Figure). The subset involving only handball players and five variables scored highest among the handball subsets (ASS = 0.20). However, the identified clusters were not associated with ACL injury risk (ARI = 0.00). <h3>Conclusions</h3> No safe or risky cutting technique strategies could be discerned among female elite handball and football players. Cluster analysis of cutting technique did not prove to be a valuable approach for assessing ACL injury risk.",1

Previous research has shown that the requirement for high-speed running, total distance and CODs are position specific, but little is known about the situational factors involved in COD maneuvers that could increase biomechanical demands during the final foot contact. <h3>Objective</h3> The objective of this study was to assess center of mass (COM) acceleration and movement during COD maneuvers during competitive soccer game to elucidate situation specific demands of COD performance. This information can assist in developing soccer-specific tests and training methods. <h3>Design</h3> Case-series. <h3>Setting</h3> One game was videorecorded with two cameras. Situational patterns were identified for each identified COD and included: ball possession (player/team), running speed (low/moderate or fast), body contact with other players during COD movement, turning side, and the angle of COD movement (90° cut/135° cut/180° pivot turn). <h3>Participants</h3> Fifteen U16–17 elite-level female youth soccer players were tracked with inertial measurement units attached on lower back. <h3>Interventions</h3> COD movements in combination with situational patterns were identified using high-speed video. <h3>Main outcome measures</h3> LASSO regression was used to identify the most important predictors related with higher vertical peak accelerations (PAv) of COM during COD movements. <h3>Results</h3> PAv in games was higher when with larger COD angles, increased running speed, or with contact when the player was challenged by the opposition. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study adds to the literature of understanding the demands of COD performance in soccer match play. The unique approach with game-specific situational data of youth female players provides increased insight on the game-demands of COD and agility performance. A larger study including more games is warranted to increase confidence in using these variables as a basis for training or testing agility.",1

Medium-term evaluations focused on potential injury recurrence and the comprehensive quality of functional recuperation. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Ankle sprains remain a dominant concern in female Futsal. Embracing preventive strategies, with an emphasis on strength and stability training, is pivotal to not only foster player well-being but also to assure uninterrupted athletic performance.",1
"577 FO29 – In-lab ACL injury risk screening lacks ecological validity, let’s go to the football field!",2024-03-01,2024,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine,Full Oral Abstracts,"Eline Nijmeijer, Stefano Di Paolo, Alli Gokeler, Anne Benjaminse","<h3>Background</h3> Establishing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk during cutting movements has traditionally been performed in relatively standardized laboratory environments. This current paradigm inherently assumes that cutting biomechanics is independent of a sport-specific context. However, measuring movement in an ecological valid environment may potentially reshape the current definition of high-risk biomechanics based on real environment data instead of laboratory data only. <h3>Objective</h3> The aim of the present study was to investigate if the presence of ACL injury risk factors depicted in the laboratory would reflect at-risk patterns on the football field. <h3>Design</h3> Players performed unanticipated cutting maneuvers in a laboratory setting and on the football field during football-specific exercises (F-EX) and games (F-GAME). <h3>Setting</h3> Youth sports <h3>Participants</h3> Twenty-four talented female football players (14.9±0.9 years old) <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> Knee kinetics were collected in the laboratory and grouped using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The clusters were used to investigate the kinematics collected on field through wearable sensors. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Hip, knee and trunk kinematics (laboratory and field) and kinetics (laboratory). <h3>Results</h3> Three clusters emerged: Cluster 1 presented the lowest knee moments; Cluster 2 presented high knee extension but low knee abduction and rotation moments; Cluster 3 presented the highest knee abduction, extension, and external rotation moments. In F-EX, greater knee abduction angles were found in Cluster 2 and 3 compared to Cluster 1 (p=0.007). In F-GAME Cluster 3 showed the lowest knee flexion angles (p&lt;0.001). In F-GAME, no differences between clusters were found regarding knee abduction angles. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Context matters. Clinically relevant differences towards ACL injury identified in the laboratory partially disappeared on the field. Players who showed relatively high knee abduction in the laboratory, which is considered as risky, showed less knee abduction on the field. In-lab injury risk screening may lack ecological validity.",1
"The Development of Specific Training Programs to Improve the Speed, Agility, Quickness, and Pass-Receiving Performance of Soccer Players",2024-03-01,2024,Dr. Ken Institute of Academic Development and Promotion,International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews,"Tong Hui, Wisute Tongdecharoen, Nopporn Tasnaina","Background and Aim: In the field of college-level soccer, the quality of training mode is directly related to the overall competitive level of the team and the individual performance of the athletes. However, although soccer training at the college level is often aimed at specialization and systematism, research has shown that several common problems prevent the optimal results of training. These problems may involve a lack of personalized, targeted, or scientifically based training programs that limit overall improvement in speed, agility, quickness, and pass-receiving performance. Some college-level soccer training programs may fail to adequately account for individual athlete differences and fail to accurately locate and address bottlenecks in specific skills and abilities. This can lead to erratic training results, making it difficult for some athletes to perform at their best in competition. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of the problems existing in the current college-level soccer training and propose a specific training program to promote the athletes in the key skills and abilities more targeted. To address these issues, this study aims to develop a specific soccer training program to improve the speed, agility, quickness, and pass-receiving performance of college-level soccer players. A specific training program is a training method that combines different training methods and principles, which can make full use of the advantages of various training methods and avoid the disadvantages of various training methods, to achieve the best training effect. The main purposes of this study are as follows: 1) To explore the training elements and mechanisms related to speed, agility, quickness, and pass-receiving performance and to provide a theoretical basis and guiding principles for specific training programs. 2) Design and implement a specific training program to provide college-level soccer players with a novel and effective way of training to improve their skill level and competitiveness. 3) To evaluate and compare the effect and improvement of the specific training program, to provide empirical evidence and suggestions for the optimization and innovation of soccer training. Materials and Methods: This study’s main objective is to develop of specific training program to improve speed, agility, quickness, and pass-receiving performance for soccer players. In this experiment, 32 school soccer players from Jiying University were selected as experimental subjects by simple random sampling. The experimental group (N=16) underwent specific training intervention, while the control group (N=16) underwent regular training. The test indicators were selected from the ""2021 National Youth Campus Soccer Summer Camp Best Team Selection Test Measures"" jointly issued by the Ministry of Education and the Department of Physical Health and Art in April 2021. There are 5 test indicators in total: the 10-meter sprint test (sec), Agility test (sec), Pass-receiving Performance (sec), quickness test (sec), and Pass performance (sec), which mainly examined the comprehensive test plan of various special physical qualities such as athletes' speed, agility of dribbling change direction, quickness, pass-receiving performance. The experimental group then followed a specific training program for 8 weeks, 3 days, and 1.30 hours per day. Result: The results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups of athletes before the experiment (p &gt; 0.05), which provided a basis for the experiment. After 8 weeks of experimental, the experimental group 5 test indicators had significant differences compared with the control group and also within the experimental group (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: This specific training program can improve the pass-receiving performance of soccer players.",1
Influence of altered torsional stiffness through sole modification of air pressure shoes on lower extremity biomechanical behaviour during side-step cutting maneuvers,2024-02-29,2024,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Md Samsul Arefin, Hsiao-Feng Chieh, Chien-Ju Lin, Cheng-Feng Lin, Fong-Chin Su","Directional changes in cutting maneuvers are critical in sports, where shoe torsional stiffness (STS) is an important factor. Shoes are designed based on different constructions and movement patterns. Hence, it is unclear how adjustable spacers into the sole constructions of air pressure chambers (APC) affect the STS in side-step cutting. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of altered STS through adjustable sole spacers on ground reaction force (GRF) and ankle and knee joint moments in side-step cutting. Seventeen healthy recreational athletes performed side-step cutting with experimental conditions including (i) barefoot (BF), (ii) unaltered shoes (UAS): soles consisting of APC, and (iii) altered shoes (AS): modified UAS by inserting elastomeric spacers into cavities formed by APC. Mechanical and biomechanical variables were measured. Significant differences were revealed across shoe conditions for impact peak (p = 0.009) and impulse (p = 0.018) in vertical GRF, time to achieve peak braking (p = 0.004), and peak propulsion (p = 0.025) for anterior-posterior GRF in ANOVA test. No significant differences were observed in GRF peaks and impulses between UAS and AS except for a trend of differences in impact peak (p = 0.087) for vertical GRF. At the ankle and knee joint, peak ankle power absorption (p = 0.019), peak knee internal rotation moment (p = 0.042), peak knee extension moment (p = 0.001), peak knee flexion moment (0.000), peak knee power absorption (p = 0.047) showed significant difference across three shoe conditions. However, no significant differences between the UAS and AS were noticed for peak joint moments and power. Altered shoe torsional stiffness did not significantly affect the peak forces and peak ankle and knee joint moments or powers; hence sole adjustment did not influence the cutting performance. This study might be insightful in sports footwear design, and adjusting shoe torsional stiffness by sole modification might be advantageous for athletes playing sports with cutting maneuvers to reduce the risk of injuries by controlling the twisting force at the ankle that frequently happens during cutting maneuvers.",1
Brace Use for ACL Injury Prevention in Soccer: Impacts on Rehabilitation and Performance,2024-02-29,2024,rScroll,Journal of Student Research,"Kristin Yueh, Janice Huang","ACL injuries are extremely common, especially in soccer, and often require extensive and invasive treatment such as surgery. Braces are almost always used to provide support and stability to the knee during the recovery period, following injury, and for preventative purposes. Additionally, braces aid the patient by preventing excessive movement and rotation that can further damage the ligament. This review article aims to explore the use of braces in the prevention and recovery of ACL injuries, especially in soccer. In addition to the physiology and biomechanics of the ACL, this article will also discuss the factors that contribute to ACL injuries including gender, playing surface, and neuromuscular traits. It will also explore the different types of braces and their unique functions and role in injury prevention and rehabilitation. With more research, we can move towards a future where ACL injuries in soccer could become a rarity rather than a common concern.",1
The Use of Free Weight Squats in Sports: A Narrative Review—Terminology and Biomechanics,2024-02-28,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Michael H. Stone, W. Guy Hornsby, Satoshi Mizuguchi, Kimitake Sato, Daniel Gahreman, Marco Duca, Kevin M. Carroll, Michael W. Ramsey, Margaret E. Stone, Kyle C. Pierce, G. Gregory Haff","There is substantial evidence indicating that increased maximum strength as a result of training with squats, particularly full and parallel squats, is associated with superior athletic capabilities, such as sprinting, jumping and agility. Although full and parallel squats have been strongly associated with sport performance, there is also some evidence that the use of partial squats may provide angle specific adaptations that are likely advantageous for specific sporting activities. Partial squats may be particularly advantageous when trained in conjunction with full or parallel squats, as this practice results in a greater training effect. There is a paucity of evidence that squatting is associated with excessive injuries to the knees, lower back, or other structures. Evidence does indicate that squatting, including full squats, can be undertaken safely, provided an appropriate training methodology is applied. Indeed, based on scientific data, the cost/benefit ratio indicates that squats should be recommended and should be a central strength training exercise for the preparation of athletes in most sports, particularly those requiring strong and powerful whole body and lower body movements.",1
"Genes Associated with Muscle, Tendon and Ligament Injury Epidemiology in Women’s Amateur Football Players",2024-02-28,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,David Varillas-Delgado,"Background: There is a lack of specific genetic studies regarding injuries in women’s football. However, different genetic factors have been associated with tendon/ligament injuries in women football players. The aim of the study was to examine the genotypic frequencies of genes associated with injury risk and epidemiology in women’s amateur football players and the aetiology of injuries. Methods: In total, 168 women’s amateur football players from football clubs in the Spanish second division league and Caucasian descent were enrolled in this prospective observational cross-sectional study. AMPD1 (rs17602729), ACE (rs4646994), ACTN3 (rs1815739), CKM (rs8111989) and MLCK (rs2849757 and rs2700352) polymorphisms were genotyped. The characteristics of 169 non-contact injuries during the 2022/2023 season were classified following the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Consensus Statement for reporting injuries as follows: musculoskeletal, tendon/ligament, injury setting; and severity. The disequilibria of polymorphisms were estimated using the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The characteristics of the injuries were recorded, and the genotype characteristics were analysed. The genotype frequencies of all polymorphisms were compared between non-injured and injured football players and injury aetiologies. Results: The AMPD1 genotype distribution differed between tendon/ligament injured and non-injured (p = 0.003) with a higher frequency in the TT genotype and T allele. The genotype distribution was different for the CKM and MLCK c.37885C&gt;A polymorphisms in training and match injuries (p = 0.038 and p = 0.031, respectively). In the ACTN3 and AMPD1 polymorphisms, the distribution of the TT genotype in both genes showed a higher frequency in severe injuries (all p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Tendon/ligament injury epidemiology in women’s amateur football players was associated especially with the TT genotype of the AMPD1 gene. The TT genotype of the AMPD1 and ACTN3 genes was also associated with severity, and the CKM and MLCK polymorphisms were associated with injury settings.",1
Knee Biomechanics During Neurocognitively Challenged Drop Landings in Male Elite Soccer Players with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2024-02-27,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine - Open,"Ghazal Mohammad Gholipour Aghdam, Mohammad Hossein Alizadeh, Hooman Minoonejad, Elham Shirzad, Jan Wilke","Abstract Background Reactive decision-making during athletic movement has been demonstrated to evoke unfavorable biomechanics associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. However, the current evidence is based on assessments of healthy individuals. We aimed to investigate unplanned jump landing kinetics and knee kinematics in ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) and non-injured athletes. Methods A total of 30 male professional soccer players (n = 15 ACLR after return to play, n = 15 matched controls) performed six drop landings onto a force plate. As a neurocognitive challenge requiring decision-making, a diode flashing in randomly selected colors indicated the requested landing location. Knee joint kinematics (flexion, valgus and tibial rotation angles) assessed with a 10-camera motion capture system, vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), time to stabilization (TTS) and length of the center of pressure (COP) trace (all analyzed from force plate data) were calculated. Cognitive function was assessed using the CNS Vital Signs battery. Results The ACLR group produced lower knee flexion angles than the control group (median [interquartile range] 50.00° [6.60] vs. 55.20° [4.45], p = .02). In addition, path length of the center of pressure (379 mm [56.20] vs. 344 mm [37.00], p = .04) and ground reaction force (3.21 N/kg [0.66] vs. 2.87 N/kg [0.48], p = .01) were higher for the ACLR group. No differences were found for knee valgus ( p = .96), tibial rotation ( p = .83) and TTS ( p = .82). ACLR participants scored lower for reaction time ( p = .02) and processing speed ( p = .01). Unfavorable knee biomechanics were more often related to cognitive function in the ACLR group than in the control group ( p &lt; .05). Conclusions Impaired reactive decision-making during athletic movement may contribute to the high re-injury risk in individuals with ACLR. Prospective studies confirming potential cause-effect relationships are warranted.",1
Can lateral tenodesis improve the rotational stability of the ACL reconstruction? A finite element analysis,2024-02-27,2024,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Konstantinos Risvas, Dimitar Stanev, Konstantinos Moustakas","One of the most common knee injuries is the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rupture with severe implications on knee stability. The usual treatment is the ACL Reconstruction (ACLR) surgery where the surgeon replaces the torn ligament with a graft in an effort to restore knee kinematics. In case of excessive rotatory instability, Lateral Extra—Articular Tenodesis (LET) can be performed in combination with ACLR. Additionally, LET appears to reduce ACLR graft forces minimizing graft failure chances. However, there are concerns about overconstraining physiological rotation. To gain insight in this controversial topic, we developed an automatic, open-source tool to create a series of Finite Element (FE) models attempting to investigate the interactions of ACLR and LET through simulation. We started by creating a validated model of the healthy knee joint that served as reference for subsequent FE simulations. Then, we created FE models of standalone ACLR and combined ACLR—LET. Each model was assessed by applying a loading profile that resembles the reduction phase of the Pivot—Shift clinical exam. We measured the External Tibia Rotation (ETR), the Posterior Tibia Translation (PTT) of the lateral tibial compartment, and the ACLR graft stress developed around the femoral tunnel insertion site. We observed the following: a) LET reduces ETR and PTT compared to isolated ACLR, b) combined ACLR—LET is more sensitive to LET graft pretension with lower values showcasing performance closer to the healthy joint, c) LET reduces ACLR graft forces for the same pretension values, d) LET exhibits significant overconstraint for higher pretension values. In general, these findings are in agreement with relevant clinical studies and accentuate the potential of the developed framework as a tool that can assist orthopaedists during surgery planning. We provide open access for the FE models of this study to enhance research transparency, reproducibility and extensibility.",1

Supervised Offseason Training Programs are able to mitigate the Effects of Detraining in Youth Men Soccer Players Physical Fitness: A Randomized Parallel Controlled Study,2024-02-23,2024,Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,Journal of Sports Science and Medicine,"GuiYang Liu, XiaoShuang Wang, Qi Xu","This study aimed to analyze the effects of three off-season training programs on the aerobic capacity, countermovement jump (CMJ), and linear sprint performance of young male soccer players. The study employed a randomized multi-arm design, consisting of three experimental groups: i) a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) group; (ii) a plyometric jump training (PJT) group; and (iii) a HIIT+PJT group; and an inactive control group. Fifty-eight under-19 male soccer players (aged 17.6 ±0.6 years) were randomly assigned to participate in a 3-week offseason training program exclusively performing HIIT, PJT, or a combination of both, while the fourth group remained inactive. Players underwent assessments twice, using the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test - Level 1 (YYIRT), CMJ, and 30-meter linear sprint. Significant interactions between time and groups were found in CMJ (p<0.001), YYIRT (p<0.001), and 30-m sprint (p<0.001). Group*time interaction revealed that the control group was significantly different from HIIT (p<0.001), PJT (p<0.001), and HIIT+PJT (p<0.001) considering the CMJ. Moreover, the control group was significantly different from HIIT (p=0.037) in YYIRT. Finally, the control group was significantly different from HIIT (p=0.024), PJT (p<0.001), and HIIT+PJT (p=0.021) considering the 30-m sprint. In conclusion, off-season training programs are effective in significantly reducing declines in CMJ and sprint performance compared to maintaining training cessation. However, in the YYIRT, only HIIT seems to be significantly superior to maintaining inactivity. To mitigate aerobic performance declines, incorporating HIIT sessions twice weekly during the offseason is advisable. To enhance or maintain jump performance, integrating at least one session of PJT weekly is beneficial.",1

Objective The current study aimed at determining PSQ and its associations with MSP in some sub-Saharan athletes. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among 205 highly trained and 115 elite athletes (aged: 25 ± 2 years, Body mass index: 22.8 ± 0.9 kg/m 2 ) in Dakar, Senegal, during a competitive season in a variety of sport disciplines including athletics, basketball, football, rugby, wrestling, tennis. Quality of sleep and MSP were assessed using the French version Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and French version of Nordic questionnaire respectively. Pain on body joints during a week was defined as seven-day MSP (MSP-7d) and PSQ for a PSQI &gt; 5. Results 27.8% (95%CI: 23.2–32.9) of the overall sample suffered PSQ, with 33.7% (95%CI: 24.7–44.0) in basketball and 24.7% (95%CI: 16.9–34.6) in football. According to athletic status and gender, PSQ was more prevalent among highly trained (66.3; 95%CI: 55.9–75.3) and men (69.7%; 95%CI: 59.5–78.7). Among athletes with PSQ 43.8% (95%CI: 33.9–54.2) suffered MSP-7d, with 36.6%; highly trained (95%CI: 23.7–42.9) and 28.1% female. Considering body region, hips/thigh (14.6%; 95% CI: 8.74–23.4) and upper back (13.5%; 95%CI: 7.88 -21, 1) were more affected.

Based on athletic status, MSP-7d were higher on highly trained necks (100%; 95%CI: 56.1–100; p = 0.04 ). PSQ was associated with basketball (OR: 3.062, 95%CI: 1.130–8.300, p = 0.02 ) compared to Athletic. PSQ and MSP-7d were associated on Wrist/hands (OR: 3.352, 95%CI: 1.235–9.099, p = 0.01 ), and at the upper back (OR: 5.820, 95%CI: 2.096–16.161, p = 0.0007 ). Conclusion These results indicate that PSQ is considerable among Senegalese athletes and is associated with MSP during a week. Hence, we recommend to look for strategies optimizing good quality of sleep in order to reduce pains, to improve health.",1

Farley, Miranda O’Hara, Justin W. L. Keogh, Carl T. Woods, Evelyne Rathbone, Nikki Milne","Objectives To explore the relationships between physical fitness and i) technical skills and ii) time-loss from Australian football injury in female players across the talent and participation pathways. Methods This study uses a subset of data from two cross-sectional and one prospective cohort studies. A total of 223 female Australian football players across five competition levels (elite/non-elite senior, high-level junior, and non-elite junior (14–17 years)/(10–13 years)) were included in this study. Comprehensive physical fitness assessments and modified Australian football kicking and handballing tests were conducted in the 2018/19 pre-seasons. During the respective competitive in-season, time-loss injuries were recorded by team personnel. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were performed to determine the relationship between physical fitness and kicking and handballing scores. Cox proportional regressions were conducted to identify physical fitness factors associated with injury. Results Increased running vertical jump height, greater hip abduction strength, and faster timed 6 m hop speed demonstrated a relationship with kicking accuracy when adjusted for years of Australian football playing experience (adjusted R 2 = 0.522, p &lt; 0.001). Faster agility time and increased lean mass were associated with better handballing accuracy (adjusted R 2 = 0.221, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression revealed an increased risk for sustaining a time-loss injury in less agile players (adjusted HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.23, 4.73, p = 0.010). However, this relationship no longer remained when adjusted for age and years of Australian football experience (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 0.81, 3.50, p = 0.166). Conclusions Physical fitness may be a significant factor contributing to development of Australian football technical skills in female players. However, its role is unclear in protecting against injury risk in this athlete population. Further research is needed to explore the multifactorial and complex phenomenon of talent development and injury risk reduction in female Australian football players.",1

Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of the STOP-X program on the knee valgus angle and static and dynamic balance in female basketball players with DKV defects. Methods The present study was a quasi-experimental study. Thirty female basketball players with DKV defects were purposefully identified by the single-leg landing (SLL) test and were randomly assigned to two control ( n = 15) and experimental ( n = 15) groups. Static balance status was evaluated with the BASS STICK test, and dynamic balance status was evaluated with the Y-balance test (YBT). The experimental group performed the STOP-X program for 25–40 min for eight weeks (three times per week), and the control group performed their traditional warm-up program. Data were analyzed by means of 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison (Bonferroni) at the significance level of ( P &lt; 0.05) with SPSS version 26. Results The results showed that with the use of the STOP-X program, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in variables of the static balance (F = 56.45; P = 0.001; ES = 0.66, PC=↑59.64%), total dynamic balance score (F = 107.57; P = 0.001; ES=↑0.79, PC=↑19.84%), and knee valgus angle (F = 119.46; P = 0.001; ES = 0.81, PC=↓34.36%). Conclusion In addition to reducing the knee valgus angle, applying the STOP-X injury prevention program can improve static and dynamic balance in female basketball players with DKV defects. Therefore, it can be recommended that sports trainers benefit from these advantages by adding STOP-X training to routine basketball exercises.",1

However, whether CMDT training can better enhance athletes’ cognitive-motor performance compared to traditional single-task (ST) training remains unclear. Method A systematic review that complied with PRISMA was carried out (Prospero registration number: CRD42023443594). The electronic databases used for the systematic literature search from the beginning through 13 June 2023, included Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. After obtaining the initial literature, two researchers independently assessed it based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the included literature was analyzed to compare the differences between ST training and CMDT training. Results After screening 2,094 articles, we included 10 acute studies and 7 chronic studies. Conclusion This systematic review shows that athletes typically show a degradation of performance in CMDT situations as opposed to ST when evaluated transversally. However, this performance decline is notably reduced following longitudinal training in CMDT, indicating the effectiveness of sustained CMDT training in enhancing cognitive-motor performance under dual-task conditions. Our study provides new insights into the application of CMDT in the field of sports training.

An 8-week injury prevention exercise program combined with change-of-direction technique training limits movement patterns associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury risk,2024-02-07,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"M. Mohr, P. Federolf, D. Heinrich, M. Nitschke, C. Raschner, J. Scharbert, A. D. Koelewijn","Abstract Knee ligament sprains are common during change-of-direction (COD) maneuvers in multidirectional team sports. This study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week injury prevention exercise program containing COD-specific exercises and a similar program containing linear sprint exercises on injury- and performance-related variables during a 135° COD task. We hypothesized that the COD-specific training would lead to (H1) stronger reductions in biomechanical variables associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk during COD, i.e. knee abduction moment and angle, hip internal rotation angle and lateral trunk lean, and (H2) more effective improvements in COD performance according to the COD completion time, executed angle, ground contact time, and approach speed. Twenty-two sports science students (40% female) completed biomechanical assessments of COD movement strategies before and after participating in two supervised 25-min training sessions per week over 8 weeks. We observed significant ‘training x group’ interaction effects in support of H1: the COD-specific training but not the linear sprint training led to reduced peak knee abduction moments (interaction, p = 0.027), initial knee abduction (interaction, p &lt; 0.001), and initial lateral trunk lean angles (interaction, p &lt; 0.001) compared to baseline. Although the COD-specific training resulted in sharper executed angles (interaction, p &lt; 0.001), the sprint-specific training group showed reduced COD completion (interaction, p = 0.037) and ground contact times (interaction, p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, a combination of generic and COD-specific injury prevention training resulted in COD technique adaptations that can help to avoid ACL injury-prone COD movements but may negatively affect COD speed.",1

Klarmann","Torn and damaged menisci resulting from trauma are very common knee injuries, which can cause pain and mobility limitations and lead to osteoarthritis. Meniscal injuries can require surgery to repair the tissue damage and restore mobility. Here we describe the biomechanical testing of a 3D-printed meniscus to illustrate methods to determine if it has the strength and durability to effectively repair meniscal tears and restore knee biomechanics. This work was designed to demonstrate the steps needed to test novel meniscus repair devices prior to moving toward animal testing. The first testing step determined the ability of the 3D-printed meniscus to withstand surgical fixation by measuring the suture pull-out force. We show that vertical 2/0 silk or Fiberwire sutures need an average of 1.4 or 1.8 N, respectively, to pull through the meniscus, while horizontal sutures need only 0.7 and 1.2 N, respectively. The next step measured the compressive strength of normal, damaged, and repaired porcine meniscus tissue. Here, we show that meniscectomy decreased the stiffness of meniscus tissue from 26.7 ± 0.85 N to 7.43 ± 0.81 N at 25% strain. Menisci repaired with the 3D-printed tissue restored 66% of the measured force at 25% strain. The final step measured the contact pressures and areas in an ex vivo porcine knee before and after meniscal repair was made with the 3D-printed meniscus tissue. The example 3D-printed meniscus was successfully sutured into the porcine knee joint but failed to restore normal knee contact pressures. This work demonstrates the need for an iterative biomechanical testing process of biomaterial development, 3D-printing optimization, and knee kinematics to develop a durable and functional meniscus repair device. In summary, the methods described here serve as a guide for the functional evaluation of novel meniscus repair devices.",1
Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in female athletes: risk factors and strategies for prevention,2024-02-05,2024,British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery,Bone &amp; Joint Open,"Fabio Mancino, Babar Kayani, Ayman Gabr, Andreas Fontalis, Ricci Plastow, Fares S. Haddad","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common and debilitating knee injuries in professional athletes with an incidence in females up to eight-times higher than their male counterparts. ACL injuries can be career-threatening and are associated with increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis in future life. The increased risk of ACL injury in females has been attributed to various anatomical, developmental, neuromuscular, and hormonal factors. Anatomical and hormonal factors have been identified and investigated as significant contributors including osseous anatomy, ligament laxity, and hamstring muscular recruitment. Postural stability and impact absorption are associated with the stabilizing effort and stress on the ACL during sport activity, increasing the risk of noncontact pivot injury. Female patients have smaller diameter hamstring autografts than males, which may predispose to increased risk of re-rupture following ACL reconstruction and to an increased risk of chondral and meniscal injuries. The addition of an extra-articular tenodesis can reduce the risk of failure; therefore, it should routinely be considered in young elite athletes. Prevention programs target key aspects of training including plyometrics, strengthening, balance, endurance and stability, and neuromuscular training, reducing the risk of ACL injuries in female athletes by up to 90%. Sex disparities in access to training facilities may also play an important role in the risk of ACL injuries between males and females. Similarly, football boots, pitches quality, and football size and weight should be considered and tailored around females’ characteristics. Finally, high levels of personal and sport-related stress have been shown to increase the risk of ACL injury which may be related to alterations in attention and coordination, together with increased muscular tension, and compromise the return to sport after ACL injury. Further investigations are still necessary to better understand and address the risk factors involved in ACL injuries in female athletes. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2024;5(2):94–100.",1
Relationships of lower extremity and trunk asymmetries in elite soccer players,2024-02-02,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Tomas Maly, Mikulas Hank, Ferdia Fallon Verbruggen, Christian Clarup, Kirk Phillips, Frantisek Zahalka, Lucia Mala, Kevin R. Ford","In light of previous research highlighting the prevalence of asymmetries in soccer players and possible links to injury risks, there is a crucial gap in the biomechanical understanding of complex relationships between lower extremity and trunk asymmetries in elite soccer players. The purpose of this study was to investigate the level, relationships, and differences among twelve different parameters of strength, morphological, and neuromuscular asymmetries in elite soccer players. Methods: Elite male soccer players (n = 25, age 21.7 ± 3.9 years) were tested in the following tests: bilateral fluid distribution, hip flexor range of motion, postural stability, isokinetic strength of knee extensors and flexors, isometric lateral trunk rotation strength, eccentric strength of knee flexors, isometric bilateral strength of hip adductors, and vertical ground reaction force in counter-movement jump-free arms, counter-movement jump, squat jump, and drop jump tests. One-way ANOVA, Pearson's coefficient (r), and partial eta squared (η p 2) were used for data analysis. Results: Significant differences in asymmetries were found in elite soccer players (F11,299 = 11.01, p < .01). The magnitude of asymmetry over 10% was in postural stability and drop jump parameters. The lowest magnitudes of asymmetries were in the fluid distribution of the lower limbs and the vertical ground reaction force during the take-off phase in squat jumps. The highest asymmetries between the dominant and non-dominant sides were found in postural stability and drop jump. A total of eleven significant correlations (p < 0.05, r = 0.41-0.63, R2 = 0.17-0.40) were detected between the analyzed asymmetries in elite soccer players. The lateral trunk rotation asymmetries were significantly correlated to vertical ground reaction force asymmetries and knee extensors. Conclusion: Long-term exposure in elite soccer leads to unilateral biomechanical loading that induces abnormal strength and morphological adaptations in favor of the dominant side while linking lower limb and trunk strength asymmetries. By unraveling these complex relationships, we strive to contribute novel methods that could inform targeted training regimens and injury prevention strategies in the elite soccer community. The data should encourage future researchers and coaches to monitor and develop trunk strength linked to lower body kinematics.",1
Monitoring Readiness to Train and Perform in Female Football: Current Evidence and Recommendations for Practitioners,2024-02-01,2024,Human Kinetics,International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance,"Marco Beato, Esben Elholm Madsen, Jo Clubb, Stacey Emmonds, Peter Krustrup","PURPOSE: Monitoring player readiness to train and perform is an important practical concept in football. Despite an abundance of research in this area in the male game, to date, research is limited in female football. The aims of this study were, first, to summarize the current literature on the monitoring of readiness in female football; second, to summarize the current evidence regarding the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and its potential impact on physical preparation and performance in female footballers; and third, to offer practical recommendations based on the current evidence for practitioners working with female football players. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners should include both objective (eg, heart rate and countermovement jump) and subjective measures (eg, athlete-reported outcome measures) in their monitoring practices. This would allow them to have a better picture of female players' readiness. Practitioners should assess the reliability of their monitoring (objective and subjective) tools before adopting them with their players. The use of athlete-reported outcome measures could play a key role in contexts where technology is not available (eg, in semiprofessional and amateur clubs); however, practitioners need to be aware that many single-item athlete-reported outcome measures instruments have not been properly validated. Finally, tracking the menstrual cycle can identify menstrual dysfunction (eg, infrequent or irregular menstruation) that can indicate a state of low energy availability or an underlying gynecological issue, both of which warrant further investigation by medical practitioners.",1

Evaluation of the lower extremity functional test to predict lower limb injuries in professional male footballers,2024-01-31,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Haniyeh Mohammadi, Raheleh Ghaffari, Abdolreza Kazemi, David G. Behm, Mahdi Hosseinzadeh","Abstract The Lower Extremity Functional Test (LEFT) is a reliable and valid test for the measurement of athletic fitness, fatigue resistance, and speed performance. Contradictory results exist regarding the screening value of the LEFT in predicting lower limb injuries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the screening value of the LEFT in predicting lower limb injuries in professional male footballers. One hundred and twenty-one professional male football players participated in the study. LEFT was recorded pre-season and the lower-limb injuries were recorded during a 9-month season. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the accuracy of the prognosis of LEFT. A total of twenty-five lower limb injuries were recorded. The model explained 53% of the variance in lower limb injury, showing that predictions by LEFT score is reliable, and correctly predicted 89.3% of cases, which is a large improvement. ROC analysis showed significant accuracy of the LEFT score (AUC 0.908, 95% CI 1.126–1.336, p = 0.001, OR = 1.227) in discriminating between injured and uninjured players. The optimum cut-off level of the LEFT score was 90.21 s; Our findings showed that the LEFT score was able to predict lower limb injuries in professional male footballers. The slower an athlete’s LEFT scores, the more susceptible they are to future injury risk. Sports medicine specialists, football coaches and managers are suggested to use LEFT as a pre-season screening test to identify and prevent the weakness and functional imbalance of the athletes before the injury occurs by conducting this test.",1

Mahmoud, Marwa M. Ibrahim, Nadia L. Radwan","Abstract Background In athletes, osteitis pubis (OP) is considered a major cause of chronic groin pain. In addition to the difficulties with diagnosis, controversy exists regarding the most appropriate treatment approach. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of a modified active physical therapy program (MAPT) on pain, hip and trunk muscle strengths, and lower extremity function in adolescent football players with OP. Methods Fifty football players aged from 12 to 18 years with OP were included and allocated into two groups: the MAPT group ( n = 24) and the traditional physical therapy (TPT) group ( n = 26). Each group received a different treatment protocol for 60 min applied 3 times/week for 12 weeks. A visual analog scale, digital hand-held dynamometer (HHD), and lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) were used to measure pain, hip and trunk muscle strengths, and lower limb function, respectively, at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention. Results There was a highly significant difference in the TPT group’s pain score ( p &lt; 0.001) compared with the MAPT group. Also, the strength of hip flexors, abductors, adductors, internal rotators, external rotators, and trunk flexors and extensors improved significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) than the TPT group. However, the between-group analysis revealed that the strength of hip extensors and LEFS in the MAPT group achieved a highly significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001) compared with the TPT group. Conclusion MAPT could be recommended strongly in the rehabilitation of OP in adolescent football players in which the functional abilities of OP patients improved because of reduced pain levels and increased hip and trunk muscle strength.

Comparison of force variables and dynamic strength index between age groups in elite young Brazilian football goalkeepers,2024-01-26,2024,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Daniel L. Portella, Pedro Jatene, Alex O. Da Silva, Gustavo S. dos Santos, Diogo Monteiro, José E. Teixeira, Luís Branquinho, Ricardo Ferraz, Pedro Forte","Introduction The application of muscle force is a determinant of football success as it is inherent to the motor control and sport. The aims of this study are: (1) to describe force variables Isometric Maximal Force (IMF), Concentric Peak Force (CPPF), and Dynamic Strength Index (DSI) in football goalkeepers from different age groups; (2) to compare these variables’ behavior between those groups. Methods The sample was formed by 19 youth players (15.97 ± 1.55 years old) from a first-division Brazilian football team. The CPPF and IMF variables were obtained through the Countermovement jump and isometric squat tests, respectively. For data collection, a force plate (Cefise, Brazil) was used with an acquisition frequency of 600 Hz and mono-axial. The DSI was calculated using the ratio between CPPF and IMF. For data analysis, the sample was separated into clusters by age. After the grouping, a descriptive analysis of the data and a comparison between the groups with p &amp;lt; 0.05. Results The sample was grouped into three groups (GA, GB, and GC) and one of the individuals did not enter the group, totaling 18 individuals in the analyzed sample. The comparison between the ages of the groups showed a significant difference and small and moderate effect size (ES), validating the cluster strategy. The CPPF and IMF variables showed increased values according to chronological age. CPPF showed a significant difference between GA-GB, (ES = very large) GA-GC (ES = very large), and GB-GC (ES = moderate). The IMF variable had significant differences between GA-GB (ES = moderate) and GA-GC (ES = very large). However, DSI showed significant differences only between GA GB (ES = small) and GB-GC (ES = very large). Conclusions The CPPF and IMF variables had constant increases and distinct values with an increase according to age, and this did not occur for DSI. The difference between CPPF and IMF compared to DSI bring to light the variability in dynamics and proportionality between muscular force in the concentric phase and maximal force in the isometric regime during the developmental process over chronological age in soccer goalkeepers.",1

Alteration in ACL loading after total and partial medial meniscectomy,2024-01-25,2024,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"S. Uzuner, L. P. Li","Abstract Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are often caused by high impact loadings during competitive sports but may also happen during regular daily activities due to tissue degeneration or altered mechanics after a previous knee injury or surgery such as meniscectomy. Most existing research on ACL injury has focused on impact loading scenarios or the consequence of ACL injury on meniscus. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of varying degrees of medial meniscectomy on the mechanics of intact ACL by performing a poromechanical finite element analysis under moderate creep loadings. Four clinical scenarios with 25%, 50%, 75% and total medial meniscectomy were compared with the intact knee finite element model. Our results suggested that different medial meniscal resections may increase, at different extents, the knee laxity and peak tensile stress in the ACL, potentially leading to collagen fiber fatigue tearing and altered mechanobiology under normal joint loadings. Interestingly, the ACL stress actually increased during early knee creep (~ 3 min) before it reached an equilibrium. In addition, meniscectomy accelerated ACL stress reduction during knee creep, transferred more loading to tibial cartilage, increased contact pressure, and shifted the contact center posteriorly. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the interaction of meniscectomy and ACL integrity during daily loadings.",1

Pilot Study on the Biomechanical Quantification of Effective Offensive Range and Ball Speed Enhancement of the Diving Header in Soccer: Insights for Skill Advancement and Application Strategy,2024-01-22,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Gongbing Shan, Yufeng Liu, Tom Gorges, Xiang Zhang, Kerstin Witte","This pioneering study presents an in-depth biomechanical examinations of soccer’s diving header, aiming to quantify its impact on ball speed enhancement (BSE) and effective offensive range (EOR). Despite the diving header’s widespread acclaim and historical significance, there remains a dearth of scientific scrutiny into its biomechanical intricacies. Employing an innovative research design featuring a static hanging ball at varied offensive distances and heights, this study replicates diverse header scenarios. The results of 3D motion quantification have shown that a physically excellent player (identified through the maximal standing long jump test) could reach an EOR around 2.64 times his body height. Furthermore, this study unveils that proficient players could attain BSE surpassing 9 m/s, signifying the diving header’s heightened efficacy compared to traditional heading techniques, which could only result in 4.5 m/s. Correlation analyses unveil noteworthy relationships, highlighting the pivotal role of head speed at impact and the influence of minimizing speed drop and temporal disparities for amplified effectiveness. Considerations for optimizing diving header execution are introduced, emphasizing the necessity for targeted training programs. Despite acknowledged limitations inherent to its pilot nature, this exploration furnishes foundational knowledge to guide subsequent research and practical applications, providing valuable insights into soccer training and skill development through a biomechanical lens.",1
Return to sports in female athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A systematic review and metanalysis,2024-01-21,2024,Elsevier BV,Journal of ISAKOS,"David Figueroa, María Loreto Figueroa, Francisco Figueroa","ImportanceReturn to sport (RTS) is considered an indicator of successful recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). In recent years, there has been major interest in documenting RTS following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Despite women being at increased risk for ACL injuries and a global increase in women's participation in sports, research has not adequately focused on female athletes.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the RTS rate in female athletes after ACLR.We hypothesize that most of female athletes can return to sports.Evidence ReviewA systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Epistemonikos) were searched for articles reporting RTS rates and contextual data in female athletes.The following search terms were used: ""anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction"" OR ""ACL reconstruction"" AND ""female"" OR ""women"" AND ""return to sports"" OR ""return to play"" to retrieve all relevant articles published between 2003 and 2023. A quality assessment of the included studies was conducted.FindingsFifteen articles were included, reporting on 1,456 female athletes participating in pivoting sports.The included studies comprised 8 cohorts, 2 case-control studies, 2 case series, 2 descriptive epidemiology studies, and 1 observational study. Eight out of fifteen studies focused solely on elite-level athletes.The participants had a mean age of 23.13 years. Soccer was the most prevalent sport among the participants, accounting for 49.7% of all athletes included. All 15 studies reported an RTS rate, yielding a meta-proportion of 69% [95% CI, 58-80%] for RTS. Nine articles reported the average time to RTS, which was 10.8 months [95% CI, 8.7-12.8 months].ConclusionsThis systematic review demonstrates that a majority of female athletes (69%) can return to sports participation at an average of 10.8 months, however, the available information is insufficient, and quantitative data and reasons for not returning to play are lacking. Future studies should establish return-to-play criteria in this population and determine reasons for not returning to play.Level of evidenceIII",1

Barnes-Wood, H. McCloskey, S. Connelly, M. D. Gilchrist, A. Ni Annaidh, P. S. Theobald","Abstract Association football, also known as soccer in some regions, is unique in encouraging its participants to intentionally use their head to gain a competitive advantage, including scoring a goal. Repetitive head impacts are now being increasingly linked to an inflated risk of developing long-term neurodegenerative disease. This study investigated the effect of heading passes from different distances, using head acceleration data and finite element modelling to estimate brain injury risk. Seven university-level participants wore a custom-fitted instrumented mouthguard to capture linear and angular acceleration-time data. They performed 10 headers within a laboratory environment, from a combination of short, medium, and long passes. Kinematic data was then used to calculate peak linear acceleration, peak angular velocity, and peak angular acceleration as well as two brain injury metrics: head injury criterion and rotational injury criterion. Six degrees of freedom acceleration-time data were also inputted into a widely accepted finite element brain model to estimate strain-response using mean peak strain and cumulative strain damage measure values. Five headers were considered to have a 25% concussion risk. Mean peak linear acceleration equalled 26 ± 7.9 g, mean peak angular velocity 7.20 ± 2.18 rad/s, mean peak angular acceleration 1730 ± 611 rad/s 2 , and 95th percentile mean peak strain 0.0962 ± 0.252. Some of these data were similar to brain injury metrics reported from American football, which supports the need for further investigation into soccer heading.",1

"14 Normative hip strength profiles in healthy female athletes: a cross sectional pilot study exploring isometric strength, age and interlimb dominance",2024-01-18,2024,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,ACL and Hamstring Injuries,"Bradley Barbour, Natasha Williams, Paulina Kloskowska","<h3>Introduction</h3> Female athletes are underrepresented in sports-focused research, with majority of the training, pre-hab and rehabilitation plans based on male data. Female specific normative values would improve understandings of female athlete requirements, facilitating guideline design for this population. Hips and pelvises differ between sexes, affecting biomechanics and movement. Yet, training and rehabilitation methods for male and female athletes remains the same. We collected hip strength data in coronal and sagittal planes to investigate any differences between the dominant and non-dominant leg and agonist-antagonist ratios. Additionally, we explored how these measures change with age. <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> Cross-sectional observational. We collected maximal isometric hip strength values from 21 female participants (engaging in sport/exercise ≥5 hours/week), using a handheld dynamometer (Mark-10 Series 3). Findings were normalised to body mass. Paired sample t-tests and linear regression were used to analyse data and address the study's research questions. <h3>Results</h3> We found no strength differences between the dominant and non-dominant legs or agonist-antagonist ratios (p&gt;0.05) in all measurements. Abduction movements were stronger in the coronal plane, and flexion in the sagittal. Interestingly, these two movements were most associated with decreased strength with age (p&lt;0.05). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Training, rehabilitation and pre-hab programmes for female athletes need to be tailored and different approaches to the established male-driven evidence should be considered. Despite abduction and flexion strength being higher in these athletes, muscles involved in these movements may have to be targeted in the training long-term due to their decrease of strength associated with age.",1

Evaluating the Efficacy of Eccentric Half-Squats for Post-Activation Performance Enhancement in Jump Ability in Male Jumpers,2024-01-16,2024,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Theodoros M. Kannas, Georgios Chalatzoglidis, Elli Arvanitidou, Nicolas Babault, Christos Paizis, Fotini Arabatzi","The purpose of the present study was to investigate effect of post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) induced by the eccentric half-squat exercise on vertical jump performance in male jumpers. The jumping height, peak power, and work were measured and evaluated in twenty male jumpers (age: 21.2 ± 1.7 years, height: 191.1 ± 3.3 cm, body mass: 81.56 ± 7.3 kg) who participated in the national championship last year. Participants performed five eccentric half-squats at 85% of their one-repetition maximum (1 RM), with a knee angle below 90°, followed by immediate and 2 min delayed jump assessments using the Squat Jump (SJ) and Countermovement Jump (CMJ) tests. Results showed that this specific PAPE protocol did not significantly improve jump performance for the SJ (Height: ES = 0.613, p = 0.462, Work: ES = 0.124, p = 0.231, Power: ES = 0.382, p = 0.125) or CMJ (Height: ES = 0.523, p = 0.368, Work ecc: ES = 0.133, p = 0.505 (only main effect time p &lt; 0.05), Work con: ES = 0.114, p = 0.101, Power ecc: ES = 0.134, p = 0.177, Power con: ES = 0.182, p = 0.195, Leg stiffness: ES = 0.095, p = 0.358) tests. Factors such as stimulus specificity, rest intervals, muscle length, and the balance between potentiation and fatigue may explain these results. This study highlights the complexity of PAPE responses and suggests that a single set of eccentric squats with a short rest may not improve jump performance in male jumpers. Further research is required to optimize the interplay between conditioning stimuli and rest periods to maximize PAPE effects in athletic performance enhancement.",1
Non-surgical treatment of oblique diaphyseal fractures of the fourth and fifth metacarpals in a professional athlete: A case report,2024-01-12,2024,Elsevier BV,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports,"Paolo Boccolari, Filippo Pantaleoni, Danilo Donati, Roberto Tedeschi","Metacarpal fractures are common sports-related injuries, often requiring tailored treatment strategies, especially in athletes. The management of oblique diaphyseal fractures poses unique challenges due to their inherent instability. This case report discusses a non-surgical approach in treating such fractures in a professional athlete. A 26-year-old professional soccer player sustained oblique diaphyseal fractures of the fourth and fifth metacarpals during training. Given the athlete's professional demands and the fracture's nature, a conservative treatment was implemented. This included the application of a modified ulnar gutter brace, allowing for immobilization of the metacarpophalangeal joints (MP) while permitting active mobilization of the interphalangeal joints(IP). The non-surgical treatment focused on achieving skeletal stability and maintaining hand function. Despite the complexity of oblique fractures, the conservative approach was successful, enabling the athlete to resume professional activities with minimal risk of fracture displacement. Regular radiographic follow-ups showed no further displacement, highlighting the effective management of such fractures through personalized conservative treatment plans. This case underscores the viability of conservative treatment for specific metacarpal fractures in athletes. Tailoring the treatment to accommodate the athlete's professional needs and understanding the biomechanical characteristics of the fracture are crucial for successful outcomes. The case also suggests that non-surgical management can be a viable option for certain complex metacarpal fractures, especially in high-demand patients.",1

Effects of Self-Myofascial Release on Athletes’ Physical Performance: A Systematic Review,2024-01-11,2024,MDPI AG,Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology,"Luis Manuel Martínez-Aranda, Manuel Sanz-Matesanz, Ezequiel David García-Mantilla, Francisco Tomás González-Fernández","Therapists and strength and conditioning specialists use self-myofascial release (SMR) as an intervention tool through foam rollers or massage rollers for soft tissue massage, with the purpose of improving mobility in the muscular fascia. Moreover, the use of SMR by professional and amateur athletes during warm-ups, cool downs, and workouts can have significant effects on their physical performance attributes, such as range of motion (ROM) and strength. The purpose of this study was to analyse the literature pertaining to these types of interventions and their effects found in different physical performance attributes for athletes. A systematic search was carried out using the following databases: PUBMED, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane, including articles up to September 2023. A total of 25 articles with 517 athletes were studied in depth. SMR seems to have acute positive effects on flexibility and range of motion, without affecting muscle performance during maximal strength and power actions, but favouring recovery perception and decreasing delayed-onset muscle soreness. Some positive effects on agility and very short-range high-speed actions were identified, as well. In conclusion, although there is little evidence of its method of application due to the heterogeneity in that regard, according to our findings, SMR could be used as an intervention to improve athletes' perceptual recovery parameters, in addition to flexibility and range of motion, without negatively affecting muscle performance.",1

3D Kinematics of Male and Female Soccer Players for a Variety of Game-Specific Skills,2024-01-08,2024,Wiley,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,"Danyon Loud, Paul Grimshaw, Richard Kelso","Soccer is played by a variety of individuals with varying abilities. The complicated lower limb movements involved within the game often lead to knee and ankle injuries, with anterior cruciate ligament injuries being the most severe with regard to rehabilitation time and ongoing health risks. This research explores the biomechanical kinematics of male and female soccer players on synthetic grass to determine whether trends in lower limb biomechanics over a variety of movements could explain injury risk. Both male and female players (n = 10) aged between 19 and 24 years performed running-based and stationary-start movements. Biomechanical measurements at the hip, knee, and ankle were recorded. Observations showed that specific differences in joint angles were largely dependent on the movements performed; however, for male players, on average, across all movements, 84.6% and 72.6% of the variation in joint angles could be explained by internal/external rotation at the hip and knee, respectively. For female players, internal/external knee rotation, as well as hip abduction and adduction, accounted for 83.6% and 80.2% of the variation in joint angles, respectively, across all the tested movements. This highlights the importance of hip mechanics and knee alignment for players when performing a variety of movements.",1
Adaptive Machine Learning Head Model Across Different Head Impact Types Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Generative Adversarial Networks,2024-01-05,2024,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Sensors Journal,"Xianghao Zhan, Jiawei Sun, Yuzhe Liu, Nicholas J. Cecchi, Enora Le Flao, Olivier Gevaert, Michael M. Zeineh, David B. Camarillo","Machine learning head models (MLHMs) are developed to estimate brain deformation from sensor-based kinematics for early detection of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the decreasing accuracy caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose a new MLHM configuration that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on target head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy: MPS mean absolute error (MAE): 0.017 (CF) and 0.020 (MMA); MPSR MAE: 4.09 s-1 (CF) and 6.61 s-1(MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation MAE. The DRCA domain adaptation approach reduces the error of MPS/MPSR estimation to be well below previously reported TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.",1

Model Properties and Clinical Application in the Finite Element Analysis of Knee Joint: A Review,2024-01-04,2024,Wiley,Orthopaedic Surgery,"Mingyue Yan, Ting Liang, Haibo Zhao, Yanchi Bi, Tianrui Wang, Tengbo Yu, Yingze Zhang","The knee is the most complex joint in the human body, including bony structures like the femur, tibia, fibula, and patella, and soft tissues like menisci, ligaments, muscles, and tendons. Complex anatomical structures of the knee joint make it difficult to conduct precise biomechanical research and explore the mechanism of movement and injury. The finite element model (FEM), as an important engineering analysis technique, has been widely used in many fields of bioengineering research. The FEM has advantages in the biomechanical analysis of objects with complex structures. Researchers can use this technology to construct a human knee joint model and perform biomechanical analysis on it. At the same time, finite element analysis can effectively evaluate variables such as stress, strain, displacement, and rotation, helping to predict injury mechanisms and optimize surgical techniques, which make up for the shortcomings of traditional biomechanics experimental research. However, few papers introduce what material properties should be selected for each anatomic structure of knee FEM to meet different research purposes. Based on previous finite element studies of the knee joint, this paper summarizes various modeling strategies and applications, serving as a reference for constructing knee joint models and research design.",1

This study addresses this crucial need by utilizing machine learning algorithms applied to data from piezoelectric sensors on a simulated head model. Employing a systematic approach, this work utilizes Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models to process the normalized sensor data, aiming to pinpoint impact locations with high precision. Through rigorous k-fold cross-validation and comprehensive performance analysis, the study reveals that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the RF model, achieving an RMSE of 0.4764 and an R <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">2</sup> of 0.9485. Feature importance evaluations suggest an optimal sensor placement strategy, potentially reducing the model complexity while retaining predictive accuracy. The superior performance of the XGBoost model, combined with strategic sensor placement, highlights the study's contribution to enhancing head impact safety measures in sports and industrial settings. The findings pave the way for future research into the deployment of intelligent safety systems, leveraging the synergy between wearable technology and machine learning.",1
Enhancing Sprint Performance and Biomechanics in Semiprofessional Football Players Through Repeated-Sprint Training,2024-01-01,2024,Human Kinetics,Journal of Applied Biomechanics,"Valentin Romero, Adrián Castaño-Zambudio, Manuel Alejandro Ortega-Becerra, Juan Antonio Vázquez-Diz, Juan Jesús Adalid-Leiva, Pedro Jiménez-Reyes","Repeated-sprint ability is a significant factor in football performance. Notably, hamstring injuries in football players often occur during sprinting activities and fatigue-inducing conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of repeated-sprint training (RST) on repeated-sprint ability variables and sprint kinematics. Fourteen semiprofessional men’s soccer players performed 8 weeks of RST, consisting of 1 to 2 sets of 5 to 8 × 30 m repeated sprints separated by 20 to 30 seconds of recovery. Sprint performance was computed from running speed data, and a high-frequency camera (240 Hz) was used to study kinematic data. Paired samples t test and repeated-measures analysis of variance were conducted for each performance and kinematic variable, respectively. After the RST period, moderate to large improvements were observed for 0 to 20 m time, 0 to 30 m time, and 20 to 30 m time. All the repeated-sprint ability-related variables were significantly improved ( P &lt; .05). In addition, during fatigue conditions, a decrease in trunk flexion and kick-back mechanism and a reduced overstriding pattern was found after RST. The findings of this study suggest that incorporating RST may lead to improved sprint performance and promote a “safer” sprint pattern, particularly during periods of fatigue.",1

Effects of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention programme on muscle strength and landing biomechanical markers of ACL injury during fatigue among youth soccer players,2024-01-01,2024,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Biomedical Human Kinetics,"Saiful Adli Bukry, Maria Justine, Raja Mohammed Firhad Raja Azidin, Noor Izzati Azhar, Mohd Azrul Anuar Zolkafi, Chi Ngai Lo, Haidzir Manaf","Abstract Study aim : This study aimed to investigate the effect of the FIFA 11+ injury prevention programme on strength and on muscle strength and landing biomechanical markers of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during fatigue among youth recreational soccer players. Material and methods : Thirty volunteer participants were assigned to the intervention group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). The intervention group performed the FIFA 11+ programme as a warm-up activities, while the control group performed unstructured warm-up twice per week for 8 weeks. The data measurements were taken before fatigue simulation (PRE), immediately after simulation (POST5), after 20 min (POST20), and 35 min (POST35) after simulation before and after the completion of the intervention. Five-minute fatigue simulation was used for fatigue induction. Muscle strength was measured using an isokinetic machine during concentric and eccentric contractions of the hamstrings and quadriceps. Meanwhile, landing biomechanics was measured by the Landing Error Scoring System. Results : No significant differences were observed in individual muscle strength, H/Q CONV, and H/Q FUNC ratio. The biomechanical landing markers showed a significantly higher score in PRE (P = 0.004; effect size = 0.32) and POST5 (P = 0.007; effect size = 0.29) in the FIFA 11+ group compared to the control group. Conclusion : Twice a week for eight weeks of FIFA 11+ is adequate to detect positive changes in biomechanical markers of ACL injury during fatigue.",1
Use of AI methods as a complement or alternative to biomechanical testing of lower limb peak torque in football,2024-01-01,2024,Politechnika Wroclawska Oficyna Wydawnicza,Acta of Bioengineering and Biomechanics,"Adam M. Szulc, Piotr Prokopowicz, Dariusz Mikołajewski","Purpose: Monitoring and assessing the level of lower limb motor skills using the Biodex System plays an important role in the training of football players and in post-traumatic rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to build and test an artificial intelligence-based model to assess the peak torque of the lower limb extensors and flexors. The model was based on real-world results in three groups: hearing (n = 19) and deaf football players (n = 28) and non-training deaf pupils (n = 46). Methods: The research used a 4-layer forward CNN neural network with two hidden layers with typical normalization for small data sets and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based on MatlabR2023a software with Neural Networks and Deep Learning toolkits and semiautomated learning algorithm selection using ML.NET. Results: The 70-90% accuracy shown in the article is sufficient here. AI provides a highly accurate, objective and efficient means of assessing neuromuscular performance, which can improve injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies. Conclusions: The high accuracy shows that AI-based models can help with this, but their wider practical implementation requires further cross-disciplinary research. AI, and in particular MLP and CNN can support both training methods and various gaming aspects. The contribution of the research is to use an innovative approach to derive computational rules/guidelines from an explicitly given dataset and then identify the relevant physiological torque of the lower limb extensors and flexors in the knee joint. The model complements existing methodologies for describing physiology of peak torque of lower limbs with using fuzzy logic, with a so-called dynamic norm built into the model.",1
Analysis of head-to-head impact in football with human finite element model considering pre-impact cervical muscle activation,2024-01-01,2024,Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers,Transactions of the JSME (in Japanese),"Takahiro EINAGA, Hiroki SAKAKIMA, Asuka HATANO, Shotaro HARA, Shinsuke SAKAI, Satoshi IZUMI","American football is characterized by its intense collision, which can induce serious injuries such as concussions and head trauma. Therefore, the evaluation of the safety of players is mandatory. In this study, we have developed a new finite element analysis model to evaluate the head kinematic response in American football. The novelty of our model is the incorporation of the effect of cervical muscle strength and pre-impact cervical muscle activation on head kinematics response. This model is based on the head-neck model extracted from the Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS). The finite element analysis of the hit movement, which is frequently seen during the American football practices, is performed with four different cervical muscle conditions; (i) early pre-impact activation, (ii) late pre-impact activation, (iii) weak muscle strength, and (iv) No pre-impact activation. We also performed an experiment to measure head kinematics response and torso rotation in the hit movement of American football players by mouthguard sensors and video motion capture system for model validation. The four conditions parameter study shows that the time history of head angular velocity with pre-impact muscle activation is better agreement with our experimental results. Therefore, it is important to model the pre-impact cervical muscle activation in the finite element analysis for evaluating the head kinematic response accurately. We also found that higher cervical muscle strength and earlier cervical muscle activation decrease the head angular acceleration at 20-35 ms after the head collision. This suggests that, in the case of low-intensity head collision, strengthening cervical muscles and activating them before the head impact by anticipating the collision can reduce head angular acceleration.",1

There were no exclusion criteria based on age, sex, or race. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Head injury linear accelerations were categorized as mild (&lt;66g), moderate (66g-106g), or severe (&gt;106g). Head impact locations, event type, and player race/ethnicity were included as model covariates. <h3>Outcome Measures</h3> SRT and RTP were measured in days. Kruskal-Wallis tests examined SRT and RTP differences by head impact severity. Multivariable negative binomial regression models analyzed associations between higher head impact severity and SRT and RTP. Effect estimates (ratios) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) excluding 1.00 were considered significant. <h3>Main Results</h3> Median linear acceleration was 66.7g, with 9 cases (17.7%) resulting from a severe (&gt;106g) linear acceleration. Median SRT and RTP were 6.1 days (IQR=5.8) and 12.3 days (IQR=7.8), respectively. No SRT (χ<sup>2</sup>=1.9; p=0.38) or RTP (χ<sup>2</sup>=0.38; p=0.83) differences were observed across impact severities. Multivariable models revealed no associations between higher head impact severity and SRT (Ratio=0.96; 95%CI=[0.71,1.30]) or RTP (Ratio=0.91; 95%CI=[0.62,1.34]), after adjusting for covariate effects. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Head injury biomechanics do not predict injury recovery. Future work should consider the role pre-injury repeated head impact exposure has on predicting SRT and RTP time given injury head impacts alone are not associated with SRT or RTP.",1
A28: Biomechanical Analysis and Research in Rugby Speed Training,2024-01-01,2024,"Boise State University, Albertsons Library",International Journal of Physical Activity and Health,Li Ren,"<bold>Purpose:</bold> Speed training is an essential and important part of rugby. Usually in confrontational events, strength will have a powerful effect, but good speed will be more than that plus works. Rugby speed drills can be complex or simple things that coaches choose. To the best of the speed required depends on the position, but every player on the field can be trained to get faster. <bold>Methods:</bold> Through the literature method, logic analysis and other related analysis of sports biomechanics of speed training in football, in order to provide some theoretical basis and reasonable suggestions for speed training, to improve the efficiency of speed training in football to make a contribution. <bold>Result:</bold> One of the most common scenes in football is when players speed up and slow down over and over again. Acceleration on the field can take many forms. Acceleration relies more on the quads and running at top speed relies more on the hamstrings and hip flexors. Acceleration depends on the strength of the buttocks, quadriceps, calves, and upper body (especially the anterior deltoid tract). Absolute strength, relative strength and running technique are also important. The process of deceleration is accomplished through centrifugal contraction of the legs, which creates the muscle elasticity to counter and mitigate impact and is a key element in the ability of athletes to perform rapid deceleration. To cushion such an impact, explosive force is absolutely essential, and the knee and hip joints also require a certain amount of flexion to effectively cushion the impact, a movement similar to the landing technique. But in actual speed training situations, a different scenario can occur, and many coaches directly relate disadvantage factors. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> First, speed training programs must be designed to meet the bioenergetic and biomechanical requirements encountered by athletes during competition and practice. Each position on the field needs to differentiate the composition of the training load to meet the different requirements that these players must meet during the game. Secondly, we should closely monitor the amount and time of speed training according to the actual situation and focus on the recovery of the body. Coaches should avoid the urge to rush, as athletes may practice incorrect sports biomechanics when they are tired. Finally, the coach should analyze the limiting factors of the disadvantageous elements, train the limiting factors of plasticity, and finally achieve the goal of improving the disadvantageous elements.",1
Analysis Of Some Biomechanical Variables To Predict The Accuracy Of Shooting Fixed Balls In Female Football Players,2024-01-01,2024,Green Publication,Educational Administration: Theory and Practice,"Rafahiya Bouchareb, Hikmat Almadhkhori, Wisam Hameed Abdulridha, Zahra saleh, Badriya Al-Hadabi","The research aims to identify the values of some biomechanical variables and their relationship to the accuracy of shooting from fixed balls outside the penalty area among female soccer players, and to find predictive equations for them. The descriptive approach was used for correlational relationships. The sample included (10) female soccer players from the state of Batna in Algeria. The results showed that the independent mechanical (kinematic and kinetic) variables (kinetic energy, linear momentum of the ball, variables of the speed and angle of launch of the ball, the circumferential speed of the kicker’s foot, and the height of the body’s center of gravity at the moment of kicking the ball ) was suitable for predicting shooting accuracy.

This system allows rapid adjustments related to gravity during both rest and activity, resulting in a physical adaptation known as balance (Soyuer &amp; İsmailoğulları, 2009). In all sports disciplines, it is crucial for athletes to demonstrate their balance performance, which is considered a motor coordination feature. The human body employs a balance mechanism to prevent falls during variable movements (Winter, 1995). Balance is a condition that requires a complex feedback and feedforward control system, operating through visual, somatosensory, and vestibular receptors (Tjernström et al., 2002). Balance proficiency is associated with factors such as muscle strength, flexibility, proprioception, and coordination (Uluç, 2023, p. 119). Balance is acknowledged as a critical skill encompassing athletes' coordination, stability, and control abilities. The performance of balance holds significant importance across all sports disciplines. In this context, the relationship between balance performance and sports performance is of great significance. The objective of this review is to examine the literature regarding the impact of different parameters and the complex balance system on sports performance, based on studies conducted between 2018 and 2023.",1

SEVI, P. KULOTHUNGAN","Finding out how strength training affected resting pulse rate and vital capacity was the goal of this investigation. Thirty male footballers from the Govt. Degree College in Ganderbal, J&amp;K, India, participated in this research. The individuals' ages varied from 18 to 24 years old. Two distinct sets of subjects, Group I and Group II, each with fifteen subjects, emerged for this research. Group 1 represented as the test group while Group 2 was designated as a control group, receiving no extra exercise outside of the required physical education classes and workouts, participating in a 12-week ST regimen three times weekly. Both categories' participants underwent tests on the chosen criteria factors, including vital capacity and resting pulse rate, applying a spirometer for measuring ultimate air exhalation following ultimate inhalation of participants prior to and following the instructional session, and radial pulse rate to measure resting pulse rate. If there are any noteworthy variances among groups, they are evaluated using a statistical analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The 'F' ratio is tested at an acceptable threshold of 0.05 that was thought to be adequate for the investigation and determined using ANCOVA. Engaging in a 12-week, thrice-weekly strength training regimen significantly improved resting pulse rate and vital capacity among football players compared to a control group. This underscores the pivotal role of commitment to strength training in enhancing athletes' overall physical well-being.",1
Associations of prior concussion severity with brain microstructure using mean apparent propagator magnetic resonance imaging,2023-12-29,2023,Wiley,Human Brain Mapping,"Bryna D. Goeckner, Benjamin L. Brett, Andrew R. Mayer, Lezlie Y. España, Anjishnu Banerjee, L. Tugan Muftuler, Timothy B. Meier","Abstract Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion studies have shown chronic microstructural tissue abnormalities in athletes with history of concussion, but with inconsistent findings. Concussions with post‐traumatic amnesia (PTA) and/or loss of consciousness (LOC) have been connected to greater physiological injury. The novel mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI is expected to be more sensitive to such tissue injury than the conventional diffusion tensor imaging. This study examined effects of prior concussion severity on microstructure with MAP‐MRI. Collegiate‐aged athletes ( N = 111, 38 females; ≥6 months since most recent concussion, if present) completed semistructured interviews to determine the presence of prior concussion and associated injury characteristics, including PTA and LOC. MAP‐MRI metrics (mean non‐Gaussian diffusion [NG Mean], return‐to‐origin probability [RTOP], and mean square displacement [MSD]) were calculated from multi‐shell diffusion data, then evaluated for associations with concussion severity through group comparisons in a primary model (athletes with/without prior concussion) and two secondary models (athletes with/without prior concussion with PTA and/or LOC, and athletes with/without prior concussion with LOC only). Bayesian multilevel modeling estimated models in regions of interest (ROI) in white matter and subcortical gray matter, separately. In gray matter, the primary model showed decreased NG Mean and RTOP in the bilateral pallidum and decreased NG Mean in the left putamen with prior concussion. In white matter, lower NG Mean with prior concussion was present in all ROI across all models and was further decreased with LOC. However, only prior concussion with LOC was associated with decreased RTOP and increased MSD across ROI. Exploratory analyses conducted separately in male and female athletes indicate associations in the primary model may differ by sex. Results suggest microstructural measures in gray matter are associated with a general history of concussion, while a severity‐dependent association of prior concussion may exist in white matter.",1

Quality Criteria for Studies Assessing the Acute Effects of Heading: Results from a UEFA Expert Panel,2023-12-27,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Sports Medicine,"Kerry Peek, Martino Franchi, Koen Lemmink, Paul Balsom, Tim Meyer","Abstract There is increasing concern regarding the effects of heading in football on brain health including cognitive, behavioural and neuromotor function, with research suggesting an association between repeated ball-head impacts and neurodegenerative disease. While longitudinal studies to determine the long-term consequences of heading are challenging, there have been short-term ‘acute’ studies conducted, with some studies lacking appropriate methodology to ensure valid results. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) established a panel of experts to determine methodological recommendations for the conduct of studies that explore the acute effects of heading (defined as a single session of heading conducted either in a laboratory setting or following match play or a training session). The aim of this panel was to create quality criteria for acute heading studies that will form part of the eligibility assessment when applying for UEFA research funding (although the criteria can be applied to the conduct of acute heading research more widely). This process was deemed necessary to counter studies with poor methodological quality that used heading trials that did not accurately represent player exposure to ball-head impacts through football practice and match play (such as small sample sizes, unrealistically high heading exposure, and a lack of consideration of confounding variables). The panel identified core design decisions that authors should consider when designing and conducting acute heading research, with key methodological requirements for each domain pertaining to participants, heading trials, confounding variables, statistics and dependent/target variables and their measurement. After two rounds of reviews, the final list of quality criteria was agreed by the panel and will be applied to the next round of UEFA grant applications.",1
Investigation of Acute Effects of Thoracic Manipulation on Trunk Flexion and Balance in Athletes,2023-12-26,2023,CBU Beden Egitimi ve Spor Bilimleri Dergisi,CBÜ Beden Eğitimi ve Spor Bilimleri Dergisi,"Nihat Sarıalioğlu, Rıdvan Türkeri","The aim of this study is to examine the acute effects of thoracic manipulation on trunk flexion and balance characteristics in athletes. 60 male team athletes with a mean age of 22.60±0.32 years participated in the study voluntarily. Trunk flexion values and balance levels of all participants were determined before manipulation. After the measurements, the participants were randomly divided into two groups as the thoracic manipulation group (TMG) and the placebo manipulation group (PMG). Then, as a single session, thoracic manipulation was applied to the TMG group and placebo thoracic manipulation was applied to the PMG group. The trunk flexions and balance levels of each participant were remeasured after the application, and the differences before and after the application were examined. Since the data analyzed via SPSS 25.0 package program showed normal distribution, paired-t test was used to evaluate the pre-application and post-application results. The results were analyzed at the p&amp;lt;0.05 significance level. In the results of the study, it was determined that there was a significant improvement in the standard deviation of forward and backward sway (FBSD), medial-lateral sway (MLSD) and used perimeter (P) parameters in post-application static balance. A significant improvement in the mean balance error monitoring (ATE) parameter in the post-application dynamic balance was also determined. An increase in trunk flexion values was observed in the TMG group after the application. As a result, it is concluded that high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) thoracic manipulation application provides instant positive contributions to trunk mobility and balance feature in athletes.",1
Explainable Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Muscle Injuries in Professional Soccer Players through Biomechanical Analysis,2023-12-25,2023,MDPI AG,Sensors,"Mailyn Calderón-Díaz, Rony Silvestre Aguirre, Juan P. Vásconez, Roberto Yáñez, Matías Roby, Marvin Querales, Rodrigo Salas","There is a significant risk of injury in sports and intense competition due to the demanding physical and psychological requirements. Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) are the most prevalent type of injury among professional soccer players and are the leading cause of missed days in the sport. These injuries stem from a combination of factors, making it challenging to pinpoint the most crucial risk factors and their interactions, let alone find effective prevention strategies. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the potential of tools provided by artificial intelligence (AI). However, current studies primarily concentrate on enhancing the performance of complex machine learning models, often overlooking their explanatory capabilities. Consequently, medical teams have difficulty interpreting these models and are hesitant to trust them fully. In light of this, there is an increasing need for advanced injury detection and prediction models that can aid doctors in diagnosing or detecting injuries earlier and with greater accuracy. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the biomarkers of muscle injuries in professional soccer players through biomechanical analysis, employing several ML algorithms such as decision tree (DT) methods, discriminant methods, logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble methods, boosted and bagged trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and XGBoost. In particular, XGBoost is also used to obtain the most important features. The findings highlight that the variables that most effectively differentiate the groups and could serve as reliable predictors for injury prevention are the maximum muscle strength of the hamstrings and the stiffness of the same muscle. With regard to the 35 techniques employed, a precision of up to 78% was achieved with XGBoost, indicating that by considering scientific evidence, suggestions based on various data sources, and expert opinions, it is possible to attain good precision, thus enhancing the reliability of the results for doctors and trainers. Furthermore, the obtained results strongly align with the existing literature, although further specific studies about this sport are necessary to draw a definitive conclusion.",1
Jones Fracture in the National Football League,2023-12-25,2023,MDPI AG,Sports,"Emily J. Luo, Albert T. Anastasio, Taylor Stauffer, Caitlin Grant, Christine J. Wu, Kevin A. Wu, Samantha Kaplan, Brian C. Lau","Background: Jones fracture, or proximal fifth metatarsal fracture, is a common injury in National Football League (NFL)-caliber athletes. Combine draft performance can greatly impact the long-term success of these athletes, and substantial emphasis has been placed on early return to play (RTP) and the minimization of post-operative complications after Jones fracture in these athletes. To date, no study has specifically described the treatment and outcomes of this injury specifically in NFL-caliber players, considering factors relevant to this unique population. Thus, the purpose of this review is to delve into Jones fracture in NFL-caliber athletes, evaluating the diagnostic, treatment, and RTP considerations. Methods: We searched Medline (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), Scopus (Elsevier), and SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost) for the concept of Jones fractures in the NFL. Using the PRISMA guidelines, a team of three reviewers conducted abstract screenings, full-text screenings, and the extraction of studies describing Jones fractures specifically in the NFL. Results: Of the 1911 studies identified, 6 primary retrospective studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The heterogeneity of the outcome reporting precluded a meta-analysis; thus, a qualitative review of manuscripts describing Jones fracture was carried out. Classification, diagnosis, and treatment considerations, RTP statistics and outcomes, and complications were discussed. Amongst the primary studies, there were 285 Jones fractures, all athletes were able to RTP, and the average time to RTP ranged from 6 weeks to 27 weeks. For complications, with operative treatment, the refracture rate ranged from 4 to 12%, and incomplete healing ranged from 7 to 50%. RTP was 15 weeks for refractures. There were no patient-reported outcomes. Conclusions: The vast majority of Zone 2/3 Jones fractures are treated with IM screw fixation with or without adjunctive orthobiologics, such as bone marrow aspirate concentrate, in NFL-caliber athletes. The six major series investigating outcomes after the operative treatment of Jones fractures in NFL players reveal very positive findings overall with regard to RTP, reoperation, and career continuation.",1

Comparison of markerless and marker-based motion capture systems using 95% functional limits of agreement in a linear mixed-effects modelling framework,2023-12-18,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Kishor Das, Thiago de Paula Oliveira, John Newell","Biomechanics analysis of human movement has been proven useful for maintenance of health, injury prevention, and rehabilitation in both sports and clinical populations. A marker-based motion capture system is considered the gold standard method of measurement for three dimensional kinematics measurements. However, the application of markers to anatomical bony points is a time consuming process and constrained by inter-, intra-tester and session reliability issues. The emergence of novel markerless motion capture systems without the use of reflective markers is a rapidly growing field in motion analysis. However an assessment of the level of agreement of a markerless system with an established gold standard marker-based system is needed to ensure the applicability of a markerless system. An extra layer of complexity is involved as the kinematics measurements are functional responses. In this paper a new approach is proposed to generate 95% functional limits of agreement (fLoA) using the linear mixed-effects modelling framework for hierarchical study designs. This approach is attractive as it will allow practitioners to extend their use of linear mixed models to assess agreement in method comparison studies in all domains where functional responses are recorded.",1
Effect of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Training for Injury Prevention and Accelerating Rehabilitation of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Athletes: A Scoping Review,2023-12-18,2023,Brieflands,Asian Journal of Sports Medicine,"Saghar Soltanabadi, Hooman Minoonejad, Mohammad Bayattork, Mohammad Seyedahmadi","Context: Recently, the use of Virtual reality (VR) and Augmented reality (AR) tools for assessing athletes’ performance in returning to sports and neuromuscular training has experienced significant growth across all age groups. Through this technology, by utilizing laboratory facilities and creating a three-dimensional simulated sports environment that closely resembles the reality and conditions of each sports discipline, athletes can train and undergo evaluation under controlled conditions. The VR and AR systems have been used recently to prevent and rehabilitate Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries and assess the motor control of injured individuals. This scoping review aimed to investigate the impact of VR and AR exercises on ACL injury prevention, ACL rehabilitation, and expediting the return to sports process. Evidence Acquisition: The scoping review follows the reporting system of systematic and meta-analysis studies (PRISMA-ScR) and utilizes the guidelines provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute for conducting various stages of work and data extraction. This study was registered in the PROSPERO database with code CRD42023446354. The search for English articles was conducted in electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SPORT Discuss, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane, using keywords such as virtual reality, rehabilitation, injury prevention, simulation, augmented reality, ACL, and anterior cruciate ligament until the end of June 2022. Inclusion criteria encompassed any primary research involving both athletes and non-athletes across all levels (from beginners to professional) and all ages and genders (male and female) who have experienced unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injury and have undergone any type and degree of sports or therapeutic intervention using VR and AR systems. Results: Twenty-six out of 204 comprehensive studies were reviewed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that biomechanical parameters related to ACL injury were measured using various methods such as real-time biofeedback, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The factors investigated showed significant changes after exercise in VR and AR environments. Conclusions: Anterior cruciate ligament injury (or any other sports injury) cannot be summarized in a single musculoskeletal dimension involving mechanical or movement dysfunction. The failure of current approaches to prevent ACL injuries, rehabilitation, and risk assessment is due to the neglect of cognitive and neurological aspects of the injury. New methods such as augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT), multidimensional rehabilitation approaches, and the utilization of virtual reality technology and novel training strategies based on the strengths of VR and AR systems (such as optimal strategy) can compensate for this scientific and practical gap.",1
Lower limbs micro-loading acutely attenuates repeated change-of-direction performance in male youth during small-sided soccer games,2023-12-18,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,"BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation","Mohamed Amine Ltifi, Hassane Zouhal, Ismail Laher, Ayoub Saeidi, Karuppasamy Govindasamy, Urs Granacher, Ridha Aouadi, Abderraouf Ben Abderrahman","Abstract Background Soccer players often wear light-weighted wearable resistance (WR) attached to different body parts during the warm-up period with the aim to improve measures of physical fitness. However, the effect of WR on physical performance is unknown. This study evaluated the effects of WR with different micro-loadings on repeated change-of-direction (RCoD) performance while executing small-sided soccer games (SSG). Methods Twenty male soccer players aged 16.0 ± 1.5 years (body mass 74.0 ± 7.4 kg, body-height 175.0 ± 10.0 cm) volunteered to participate in this study. Following a within-subject study design, players performed four specific warm-up protocols in randomized order with a rest of 72 h between protocols: (1) WR micro-loadings with 0.1% of body mass (WR0.1); (2) WR micro-loadings with 0.2% of body mass (WR0.2); (3) WR micro-loadings with 0.3% of body mass (WR0.3); (4) no WR (control = CONT). After the warm-up protocols, players performed 2 sets of 20-min SSG. The RCoD was collected at the 8th min of SSG (SSG 1–8 min), the 15th min of SSG1 (SSG1-15 min), and at the 15th min of SSG2 (SSG2-15 min). Outcomes included mean and total RCoD indices (i.e., mean time and total time for each condition). Results Based on the outcomes of a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), WR0.1 and WR0.2 were more effective than control in dampening the decrease of RCoD’s total time during SSG1-8 min, and SSG2-15 min (small ES: 0.24–0.35; p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between WR0.3 and control. In addition, WR0.1 and WR0.2 significantly affected the decreases in RCoD’s mean best time during SSG1 and SSG2 which was observed in the unloaded condition (CONT) and consequently displayed a lower rate of RCoD performance decrease. Conclusion This study reports that wearing lower extremity WRs with micro-loads of 0.1% or 0.2% of body mass attenuates physical fatigue indicated in attenuated RCoD performance while executing SSG.",1
Nitric Oxide in the Field: Prevalence and Use of Nitrates by Dietitians and Nutritionists in Spanish Elite Soccer,2023-12-16,2023,MDPI AG,Nutrients,"Jaime Sebastiá-Rico, Daniel Cabeza-Melendre, Liam Anderson, José Miguel Martínez-Sanz","Soccer players make frequent use of dietary supplements to improve performance. One of the most widely used strategies to optimize performance is to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide through nitrates, as it could delay fatigue during physical exertion, among other benefits. This may be positive for performance in soccer, although there is almost no research in professional soccer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of nitrates and behaviours related to their consumption in Spanish elite soccer clubs. Dietitian-nutritionist representatives from 45 teams from the most important Spanish soccer leagues completed an online survey to determine if, when, how and why nitrates are prescribed to soccer players. Of the total sample, 55.6% indicated providing nitrates, always before matches, but only 36% in training. There was a wide variation and lack of consistency in the timing, dosage and form of administration of nitrates. The use of mouthwashes or the protocol of chronic nitrate intake was not taken into account in most cases. The present study indicates a lack of interpretation between scientific knowledge and its application in practice, highlighting the need for future research to better understand how to optimize the use of nitrates in professional soccer.",1

An investigation of tendon strains in jersey finger injury load cases using a finite element neuromuscular human body model,2023-12-14,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Lennart V. Nölle, Eduardo Herrera Alfaro, Oleksandr V. Martynenko, Syn Schmitt","Introduction: A common hand injury in American football, rugby and basketball is the so-called jersey finger injury (JFI), in which an eccentric overextension of the distal interphalangeal joint leads to an avulsion of the connected musculus flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon. In the field of automotive safety assessment, finite element (FE) neuromuscular human body models (NHBMs) have been validated and are employed to evaluate different injury types related to car crash scenarios. The goal of this study is to show, how such a model can be modified to assess JFIs by adapting the hand of an FE-NHBM for the computational analysis of tendon strains during a generalized JFI load case. Methods: A jersey finger injury criterion (JFIC) covering the injury mechanisms of tendon straining and avulsion was defined based on biomechanical experiments found in the literature. The hand of the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS) version 3.0 was combined with the musculature of THUMS version 5.03 to create a model with appropriate finger mobility. Muscle routing paths of FDP and musculus flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) as well as tendon material parameters were optimized using literature data. A simplified JFI load case was simulated as the gripping of a cylindrical rod with finger flexor activation levels between 0% and 100%, which was then retracted with the velocity of a sprinting college football player to forcefully open the closed hand. Results: The optimization of the muscle routing node positions and tendon material parameters yielded good results with minimum normalized mean absolute error values of 0.79% and 7.16% respectively. Tendon avulsion injuries were detected in the middle and little finger for muscle activation levels of 80% and above, while no tendon or muscle strain injuries of any kind occurred. Discussion: The presented work outlines the steps necessary to adapt the hand model of a FE-NHBM for the assessment of JFIs using a newly defined injury criterion called the JFIC. The injury assessment results are in good agreement with documented JFI symptoms. At the same time, the need to rethink commonly asserted paradigms concerning the choice of muscle material parameters is highlighted.",1

Despite prior findings that confirmed positive effects on physical recovery after exercises, whether compression sportswear can enhance exercise performances has not been determined. Thus, this systematic meta-analysis examined the effects of compression sportswear on exercise performances including speed, endurance, strength and power, functional motor performance, and sport-related performance. We calculated effect sizes by comparing changes in exercise performances between the compression garment and the control group. Two additional moderator variable analyses determined whether altered exercise performances were different based on the types of participants and compression sportswear. For the total 769 participants from 42 included studies, the random-effect model found that compression sportswear significantly improved speed, endurance, and functional motor performances. Additional moderator variable analyses identified significant positive effects on speed for athletes, and endurance and functional motor performance for moderately trained adults. Further, whole-body compression garments were beneficial for improving speed, and lower-body compression garments effectively advanced endurance performances. For functional motor performances, both upper- and lower-body suits were effective. These findings suggest that wearing compression sportswear may be a viable strategy to enhance overall exercise performances.",1
GroundLink: A Dataset Unifying Human Body Movement and Ground Reaction Dynamics,2023-12-10,2023,ACM,SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Conference Papers,"Xingjian Han, Ben Senderling, Stanley To, Deepak Kumar, Emily Whiting, Jun Saito","The physical plausibility of human motions is vital to various applications in fields including but not limited to graphics, animation, robotics, vision, biomechanics, and sports science. While fully simulating human motions with physics is an extreme challenge, we hypothesize that we can treat this complexity as a black box in a data-driven manner if we focus on the ground contact, and have sufficient observations of physics and human activities in the real world. To prove our hypothesis, we present GroundLink, a unified dataset comprised of captured ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) synchronized to standard kinematic motion captures. GRF and CoP of GroundLink are not simulated but captured at high temporal resolution using force platforms embedded in the ground for uncompromising measurement accuracy. This dataset contains 368 processed motion trials (∼ 1.59M recorded frames) with 19 different movements including locomotion and weight-shifting actions such as tennis swings to signify the importance of capturing physics paired with kinematics. GroundLinkNet, our benchmark neural network model trained with GroundLink, supports our hypothesis by predicting GRFs and CoPs accurately and plausibly on unseen motions from various sources. The dataset, code, and benchmark models are made public for further research on various downstream tasks leveraging the rich physics information at https://csr.bu.edu/groundlink/.",1
The Coronal Alignment of Lower Limbs in the Adolescent Football and Ice Hockey Players,2023-12-09,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Indian Journal of Orthopaedics,"Nik Žlak, Zmago Krajnc, Aljaž Merčun, Matej Drobnič, Alan Kacin","Abstract Background To investigate the influence of sport-specific activities on coronal axial alignment of the lower limbs in adolescent football and ice hockey players. Methods This cross-sectional study targeted healthy adolescent male football and ice hockey players with at least 3 years of sports participation. 90 football and 38 ice hockey players aged 12–16 years were divided into five age-matched subgroups. Coronal alignment of the lower limbs was determined by measuring the players' intercondylar or intermalleolar (ICD-IMD) distance with a custom-made calliper. In addition, their sports history was recorded. An age-matched comparison between the two sports groups was performed using the two-way model ANOVA and a multiple regression model for ICD-IMD was constructed. Results were additionally compared with age-matched data from the general population published in recent literature. Results A statistically significant increase in ICD-IMD values ( p &lt; 0.05) was found between 12 (football 0 mm; ice hockey − 64 mm) and 16 years (football 340 mm; ice hockey 310 mm) in both sports groups. Results of regression analysis of pooled group data showed that ICD-IMD has low positive correlation (r = 0.407; r 2 = 0.168; p &lt; 0.05) with time of participation in sport, but no association with age of athletes at the start of their sport participation (r = − 0.018; r 2 = 0.000; p &gt; 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time point. Both sports groups showed a significant increase in ICD-IMD values (mean 198 mm) after the age of 14 compared to the general population. Conclusions Participation in football and ice hockey is associated with a similar increase in ICD-IMD in the adolescent years in male athletes. The observed increase was higher in both groups of athletes than in their peers who do not regularly participate in sports. Level of Evidence Level 4 (case series).",1
Isometric and isokinetic strength of lower-limb muscles in female athletes during different phases of menstrual cycle: a causal-comparative study,2023-12-08,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,BMC Women's Health,"Fatemeh Pournasiri, Mostafa Zarei, Elena Mainer-Pardos, Hadi Nobari","Abstract Background Muscle strength is affected by different stages of the menstrual cycle in women. Since the strength of the lower limb muscles plays a significant role in the occurrence of anterior cruciate ligament injury, it seems necessary to study the strength of the lower limb muscles at different stages of this cycle to take preventive measures. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the isometric and isokinetic strength of lower limb muscles in female athletes at different menstrual cycle stages. Methods The present study is of a causal-comparative type. Thirty-seven female athletes in anterior cruciate ligament injury high-risk disciplines participated in this study. Isometric and isokinetic knee extensors and flexors muscle strength status, including the traditional hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratios, were recorded at different stages of the menstrual cycle (follicular, ovulatory, luteal) by Biodex isokinetic dynamometry system 4. Then, the obtained results were analyzed by repeated measure analysis of variance. Results Analysis of variance with repeated measures showed isokinetic and isometric strength in the knee flexor and extensor muscles at an angular velocity of 60˚/s in the ovulatory phase are higher than the follicular and luteal ones. The strength of the muscles declined during the follicular and luteal phases ( p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions Due to the negative effect of the follicular and luteal stages of the menstrual cycle on the strength of the flexor and extensor muscles of the knee, the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury may increase during this period. Therefore, it is recommended that all female coaches and athletes take preventive measures during this period.",1

Are change of direction speed and agility different abilities from time and coordinative perspectives?,2023-12-07,2023,Public Library of Science (PLoS),PLOS ONE,"Mónica Morral-Yepes, Oliver Gonzalo-Skok, Thomas Dos´Santos, Gerard Moras Feliu","This study aimed to test whether agility and change of direction speed (COD) are independent capacities using the same movement pattern (1) in terms of the completion time and (2) the entropy. Seventeen semi-professional female football players participated in the study. The agility task consisted of a Y-shaped (45° COD) task with three possible exit options (center, right and left) performed pre-planned or in reaction to the movement of two testers (i.e., blocking exit gates). Players' acceleration was measured using an inertial measurement unit. Entropy was calculated from the acceleration signal and completion time was extracted using a magnet-based timing system. Significantly greater times and lower entropy (p<0.001) were found during agility runs to pre-planned COD runs. Furthermore, weak to moderate correlations were found between COD and agility for both completion time (r = 0.29, p<0.001) and entropy (r = 0.53, p<0.001, r2 = 28.1%). These results highlight that COD speed and agility are independent capacities and skills, and as such, should be tested and trained as distinct, separate qualities. Modifying task constraints including a reactive stimulus (i.e., cognitive factors), is essential for increasing task complexity by altering the biomechanical and coordinative aspects of the action.",1
Epidemiological study of pediatric ACL injuries,2023-12-04,2023,GSC Online Press,World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,"Y. El Qadiri, Y. El Andaloussi, AR. Haddoun, M. Raad, M. Brax, M. Fadili","ACL rupture in children is a serious injury that exposes the knee to meniscal damage and then, in the medium term, to osteoarthritis. The incidence of this type of injury has been rising steadily since the 1990s with the everincreasing practice of ""pivotal"" sports such as football, basketball, handball, rugby and gymnastics. The aim was to study the characteristics of the population of subjects affected and to identify risk factors for meniscus and cartilage damage. This was a retrospective, descriptive and analytical epidemiological study of 80 children who had consulted an orthopaedic clinic for an ACL rupture. At the orthopaedic consultation centre at Haguenau Hospital, from March 2014 to November 2022, with an average age of 13.8 years. Diagnosis was based on questioning, clinical examination and MRI as paraclinical examinations. The 15 parameters analysed were as follows: age at the time of the initial trauma, sex, corrected body mass index (BMI), side, type of sport practised, sporting level, Tegner score, circumstances of the causal trauma, time to consultation, time to MRI, attempt at functional treatment, time to surgery, associated meniscal lesions. The age at the time of surgery, and at the end the operative report. There is still a debate on the optimal treatment of ACL ruptures. Most surgeons who specialise in this area support early surgery, with the aim of preventing secondary damage and returning to the previous level of physical activity as quickly as possible. Of the 80 cases, 88.75% were treated surgically and 11.25% functionally, with a median corrected BMI of 19.7. 41.25% of cases had associated meniscal lesions. The 3 most frequently practised sports were handball, rugby and football. We also found a close relationship between meniscal injury and corrected BMI. Our results are in line with the literature, which is in favour of early repair of the anterior cruciate ligament in adolescent athletes, especially those with a BMI.",1

The Kneeling Isometric Plantar Flexor Test: Preliminary Reliability and Feasibility in Professional Youth Football,2023-11-30,2023,MDPI AG,Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology,"John J. McMahon, Nicholas J. Ripley, Paul Comfort, Francisco Javier Robles-Palazón, Jack T. Fahey, Andrew J. Badby, Christopher Bramah","Calf injuries are common in professional football; thus, the establishment of reliable and time-efficient methods of measuring the peak force capabilities of the plantar flexors with equipment that is accessible to football practitioners is valuable. In this study, we determined the preliminary reliability and feasibility of a new test, termed the kneeling isometric plantar flexion test (KIPFT), for footballers. Twenty-one male youth footballers (age = 17.8 ± 1.1 years, height = 182 ± 5 cm, weight = 77.6 ± 5.9 kg) from English League One football clubs completed three trials of the KIPFT on a wireless force plate at the end (2022–2023) and start (2023–2024) of the season. The within-session reliability of the peak force (relative to body weight) was good–excellent for both limbs and both occasions. On average, performance of the KIPFT took just over 1 min per limb and ~2 min to set up. The peak force values were larger for the non-dominant limbs only at the start versus the end of the season, but there were no between-limb differences. From these results, it was determined that (1) the KIPFT is feasible, (2) a minimum of 32 footballers would be required to establish its between-session reliability with ≥80% statistical power and (3) large-cohort normative data for the KIPFT may be best collected at the start of the football season.",1

Methods: Twenty-five seven-a-side soccer players were recruited from two senior national teams. The players completed the following protocols during 10 weeks of training: a) FIFA 11+: The FIFA group (n = 13) underwent the FIFA 11+ program combined with regular soccer training; b) Dynamic conventional warm-up: The control group (n = 12) underwent regular soccer training. Their ability was validated using a pre-test followed by a post-test to measure the sprint performance (5-, 10-, and 20-m sprints), a modified agility T-test (MAT), and a five-jump test (FJT). Results: A comparison of pre- and post-tests for physical performance in each group demonstrated that the FIFA 11+ warm-up significantly improved the 10-m sprinting performance (p = 0.034; F = 5.04; ηp2 = 0.17) and reduced the time spent to perform the MAT (p = 0.000; F = 23.16; ηp2 = 0.52) in the FIFA group compared with the control group; however, no significant changes were observed in the 5- and 20-m sprints and FJT. Conclusion: The main findings of this research showed that the 10-week FIFA 11+ program led to significant improvements in the 10-m sprint and MAT compared to regular training among elite seven-a-side soccer players. Given these positive outcomes, further studies on the practical implementation and optimization of the FIFA 11+ program are warranted to provide valuable guidance for coaches and athletes, seeking to maximize its benefits in real-world settings.",1
Improvement of Groin Pain in a Football Player with Femoroacetabular Impingement via a Correction of the Pelvic Position—A Case Report,2023-11-30,2023,MDPI AG,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Oliver Ludwig, Günther Schneider, Jens Kelm","Background: Femoroacetabular impingement is one possible cause for groin pain and can lead to long periods of absence for football players. In cam impingement, the end-grade position of the leg at kicking makes the hip particularly prone to faulty contact between the acetabulum and the femoral head. Studies suggest that the resting position of the pelvis in the sagittal plane may have an important role in the biomechanics of movement in the presence of cam impingement. Methods: A 19-year-old male competitive footballer complained of sudden groin pain during a period of low athletic load. Biomechanical tests (3D posture and isometric strength analyses) showed that unbalanced individual strength training had resulted in an increased forward tilt of the pelvis. At the same time, cam impingement was confirmed radiologically, which obviously contributed to the sudden onset of the symptoms. The kicking technique of the athlete showed increased hip and trunk flexion, which also indicated a muscular imbalance. Targeted strength and stretching exercises three times a week improved the pelvic position in terms of reduced anteversion. At the same time, the patient performed strength exercises to improve his kicking technique. Results: After 8 weeks, improvements in his pelvic position and global posture and increased muscle strength could be verified. At the same time, the athlete was free of complaints again. Conclusions: When groin pain occurs in football players with cam impingement, special attention should be paid to the resting position of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. Correcting increased pelvic anteversion can prevent unfavourable end-grade collisions of the acetabulum and femoral head during kicking with strong hip flexion and adduction. Possible changes in the pelvic position due to adverse individual strength training performed by young athletes should always be kept in mind.",1
Lumbar multifidus characteristics and body composition in university level athletes,2023-11-30,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Meagan Anstruther, Amanda Rizk, Stephane Frenette, Maryse Fortin","Introduction Body composition is well known to affect sport performance and previous studies suggested that structural and functional lumbar multifidus (LM) impairments in athletes were associated with low back pain and lower leg injuries. However few studies have examined the relationship between LM characteristics and body composition in athletic populations. Methods This cross-sectional study included a total of 134 university varsity athletes (hockey, soccer, rugby, and football players). Ultrasound imaging was used to examined LM characteristics at the L5 bilaterally [e.g., size, thickness at rest, thickness during contraction, echo-intensity (EI) and % thickness change from rest to contraction] and body composition parameters (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between LM characteristics and body composition parameters. One-way ANOVA assessed differences in LM characteristics and body composition between sports. All analyses were performed separately by sex. Results LM size and thickness were positively correlated with weight, height, lean body mass and total bone mass (male: r = 0.23–0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.01–0.05; female: r = 0.30–0.39, p &amp;lt; 0.01–0.05). LM EI was strongly correlated with % body fat (male: r = 0.62, female: r = 0.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01). LM thickness at rest ( r = 0.42, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and contracted ( r = 0.27, p &amp;lt; 0.05) were positively correlated and % thickness change was negatively correlated with % body fat in male athletes ( r = −0.43, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Discussion The significant differences in body composition and LM characteristics between sports may be attributed to sport specific demands. Understanding connections between body composition and LM may aid in preseason screening for athletes at risk of low back pain or lower leg injuries during the season.",1
Mechanisms for handling uncertainty in sensorimotor control in sports: a scoping review,2023-11-26,2023,Informa UK Limited,International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology,"Damian Beck, Ernst-Joachim Hossner, Stephan Zahno","In complex naturalistic sensorimotor behaviour, uncertainty arises from ambiguities and delays in sensory inputs as well as noise in sensory detection and motor execution. In sports, where human capacity reaches its limits, handling uncertainty is crucial. In fundamental motor-control research, five mechanisms for handling uncertainty – multisensory integration, prior-knowledge integration, risk optimisation, redundancy exploitation, and impedance control – have been proposed based on a rich body of evidence, mostly investigating simple arm and hand movement tasks. Here we review the literature investigating more complex tasks and examine to what extent these mechanisms explain handling uncertainty in sensorimotor control in sports. A systematic search following the PRISMA guidelines resulted in the consideration of 82 studies. These studies provide robust empirical evidence for the mechanisms of multisensory integration, prior-knowledge integration, and redundancy exploitation in complex naturalistic behaviour, whilst only a few publications focused on the other two mechanisms. Furthermore, only a few studies test model-based predictions that can be derived from the theoretical frameworks to a satisfactory extent. Finally, beyond discussing these explanatory mechanisms in isolation, we propose a unifying model that builds upon the theory of optimal feedback control, in which the mechanisms can be related to each other coherently.",1

This paper aims to understand that the prevalence and risk factors associated with these injuries are crucial for effective injury prevention and the overall well-being of adolescent athletes. This systematic review synthesizes the existing literature on sports-related injuries in adolescent athletes. A comprehensive search was conducted, yielding 11 relevant studies. The studies were analyzed to determine the prevalence of injuries and identify associated risk factors. A qualitative synthesis of the findings was performed. The included studies collectively highlight the significant burden of sports-related injuries among adolescent athletes, with prevalence rates ranging from 34.1% to 65%. Specific risk factors associated with these injuries include body mass index (BMI), physical activity patterns, age, gender, sport type, previous injuries, and training practices. Obese adolescents, those engaged in excessive weekly practice hours, younger athletes, and females were found to be at higher risk. Certain sports, such as soccer and football, exhibited higher injury rates. Sports-related injuries in adolescent athletes are a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors. Tailored injury prevention strategies are essential, considering the specific needs of adolescent athletes in different sports and age groups. Interventions should encompass physical and educational components, emphasizing proper warm-ups, protective equipment use, and injury prevention education. Longitudinal studies and standardized injury reporting systems are needed to monitor injury trends and evaluate prevention strategies effectively. This systematic review contributes to our understanding of sports-related injuries in adolescent athletes and underscores the importance of evidence-based injury prevention efforts.",1
Significant relationship between musculoaponeurotic attachment of the abdominal and thigh adductor muscles to the pubis: implications for the diagnosis of groin pain,2023-11-20,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Anatomical Science International,"Suthasinee Tharnmanularp, Satoru Muro, Akimoto Nimura, Takuya Ibara, Keiichi Akita","Abstract Groin pain is prevalent in orthopedic and sports medicine, causing reduced mobility and limiting sports activity. To effectively manage groin pain, understanding the detailed anatomy of supporting muscles is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the musculoaponeurotic attachments on the pubis and the relationship among intramuscular aponeuroses of abdominal and thigh adductor musculatures. Macroscopic analyses were performed in 10 pelvic halves. The bone morphology of the pubis was assessed in two pelvic halves using microcomputed tomography. Histological investigations were conducted in two pelvic halves. The external oblique aponeurosis extended to the adductor longus aponeurosis, forming conjoined aponeurosis, which attached to a small impression distal to the pubic crest. The gracilis aponeurosis merges with the adductor brevis aponeurosis and is attached to the proximal part of the inferior pubic ramus. The rectus abdominis and pyramidalis aponeuroses were attached to the pubic crest and intermingled with the gracilis-adductor brevis aponeurosis, forming bilateral conjoined aponeurosis, which attached to a broad area covering the anteroinferior surface of the pubis. Histologically, these two areas of conjoined aponeuroses were attached to the pubis via the fibrocartilage enthesis. Microcomputed tomography revealed two distinctive bone morphologies, a small impression and an elongated osseous prominence on pubis, corresponded to the two areas of conjoined aponeuroses. This study demonstrated close relationships between the aponeurotic attachment of the external oblique and adductor longus, and between the rectus abdominis, pyramidalis, gracilis, and adductor brevis. The findings of aponeurotic complexes would aid in diagnostic and surgical approaches for athletic groin pain.",1
Incline and decline running alters joint moment contributions but not peak support moments in individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and controls,2023-11-17,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Kenneth Harrison, Hillary H. Holmes, Eric B. Finley, Keven Santamaria Guzman, Katherine C. Kimbrough, Jaimie A. Roper","Individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) commonly exhibit altered gait patterns, potentially contributing to an increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA). Joint moment contributions (JMCs) and support moments during incline and decline running are unknown in healthy young adults and individuals with an ACLR. Understanding these conditional joint-level changes could explain the increased incidence of OA that develops in the long term. Therefore, this knowledge may provide insight into the rehabilitation and prevention of OA development. We aimed to identify the interlimb and between-group differences in peak support moments and subsequent peak ankle, knee, and hip JMCs between individuals with an ACLR and matched controls during different sloped running conditions. A total of 17 individuals with unilateral ACLR and 17 healthy individuals who were matched based on sex, height, and mass participated in this study. The participants ran on an instrumented treadmill at an incline of 4°, decline of 4°, incline of 10°, and decline of 10°. The last 10 strides of each condition were used to compare the whole-stance phase support moments and JMCs between limbs, ACLR, and control groups and across conditions. No differences in JMCs were identified between limbs or between the ACLR and healthy control groups across all conditions. Support moments did not change among the different sloped conditions, but JMCs significantly changed. Specifically, ankle and knee JMCs decreased and increased by 30% and 33% from an incline of 10° to a decline of 10° running. Here, the lower extremities can redistribute mechanics across the ankle, knee, and hip while maintaining consistent support moments during incline and decline running. Our data provide evidence that those with an ACLR do not exhibit significant alterations in joint contributions while running on sloped conditions compared to the matched controls. Our findings inform future research interested in understanding the relationship between sloped running mechanics and the incidence of deleterious acute or chronic problems in people with an ACLR.",1

Analysis of mechanical principle of banana ball,2023-11-17,2023,EWA Publishing,Theoretical and Natural Science,Shixian Liu,"The banana ball is a famous way to score goals in football matches. In the flight, the ball bypasses the defensive wall, giving the goalkeeper the illusion that the ball is far away from the goal, and then the ball will suddenly change direction. In order to improve the scoring probability and make training more efficient and scientific, in this article, the mechanics principle of banana ball is analyzed. A complete and comprehensive analysis of the ball motion from kick-out to flight in the air is presented. The analysis of flight considers the magnitudes of air resistance, Magnus force and Bernoulli's principle. The complete equation of motion is established. The numerical simulation by Matlab is used to simulate flight path. The flight curve of banana ball is successfully simulated. The result is consistent with real phenomenon.

MUSCLE STRENGTH EVALUATION AFTER ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION USING ISOKINETIC DYNAMOMETRY,2023-11-15,2023,Peytchinski Publishing Ltd.,Journal of IMAB - Annual Proceeding (Scientific Papers),"Maria Ganeva, Miglena Tsvetkova-Gaberska, Iliya Kanelov, Nevena Pencheva","Purpose: The aim of this report is to measure and analyse the isometric and isokinetic (concentric) peak torque (PT) of knee extensors and flexors of the involved and uninvolved limb of twin professional football players over one year post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). To calculate the unilateral and bilateral asymmetry indexes and compare the athlete's PT values with sport-specific and position-specific data. Case description: Strength measurements of the knee extensors and flexors were conducted on two ACLR football players (twins) on the involved and uninvolved limbs in isometric and concentric modes of muscle contractions, and unilateral/bilateral asymmetry indexes were calculated. Results: The peak torque isometric data indicated that the strength characteristics of the involved leg extensors in both patients were significantly lower compared to the uninvolved limb and were indicators of higher secondary injury risk. The first athlete's concentric peak torque values showed relatively good return-to-sport results, while the second football player returned to sport having not met the recovery criteria. Both athletes require additional specific muscle strength exercises on the extension and flexion muscle groups to reach the ACL reconstruction recovery targets. Conclusions: In this case report, the possibilities of isokinetic dynamometric testing in an isometric and concentric mode of football players to more accurately assess the extent of the muscle strength deficiency and asymmetry are demonstrated. This more precise information allows to the creation of correct training and therapeutic program to recover the knee muscle groups' strength and unilateral/bilateral strength balance to avoid reinjury.",1

A paired samples t-test showed significant reductions in UCJ jump height in the right leg after the 30-15 IFT (p = 0.018; d = 0.33), but not in the left leg (p = 0.459; d = 0.48). For the UDJ, significant reductions in jump height were shown in both the right (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.33) and left (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.33) legs. In addition, for the reactive strength index (UDJ), significant reductions were seen in the left leg after the 30-15 IFT (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.31), but not in the right leg (p = 0.948; d &lt; 0.001). Only UCJ inter-limb jump height asymmetries increased significantly post 30-15 IFT (p = 0.033; d = 0.46). In conclusion, the current study indicates that the 30-15 IFT provides a sufficient dose of activity for inducing acute fatigue in elite youth female team sport athletes. Therefore, monitoring jump height in unilateral jump testing is recommended given the tests’ sensitivity to detect significant differences in physical performance and inter-limb asymmetries under acutely fatigued conditions in healthy youth female athletes.",1

Interventions and automation based on Lean and ergonomics principles have strong influence on performance improvement of the production systems. This study focuses on implementation of lean manufacturing and ergonomics principles to improve work environment and performance of the soccer manufacturing production line. Work visualization and value stream mapping (VSM) techniques were employed to identify the opportunities for improvements. Time of value and non-value-added activities is recorded using time study method. Working postures and associated risk factors are evaluated using Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Lean manufacturing principles are employed to minimize wastes and non-value added activities. Similarly, improvements in work environment are made through ergonomics interventions. Various models comprising different levels of lean and ergonomics interventions were evaluated through simulation before actual implementation. The results of the finalized model in terms of decrease in cycle time (8.64 to 7.018 seconds), increase in daily production (20505 to 24176 soccer balls), and improved work environment are evident of performance improvements in all aspects. The integration of lean and ergonomics principles leads to improve the productivity and working environment for workers in soccer ball manufacturing industry.",1
Impact of active intra-complex rest intervals on post-back squat versus hip thrust jumping potentiation,2023-11-10,2023,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Scientific Reports,"Robert Urbański, Piotr Biel, Sebastian Kot, Dawid Perenc, Piotr Aschenbrenner, Petr Stastny, Michał Krzysztofik","This study investigated the impact of active rest intervals within a lower body complex training session on post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) response in amateur soccer players. Twelve soccer players took part in four different experimental conditions. These sessions included 2 sets of lower body complex-paired exercises, each involving 3 repetitions of either back squats or hip thrusts at 90% one-repetition maximum (1RM) as a conditioning activity paired with a broad jump and countermovement jump. Between those exercises in active intra-complex rest interval conditions, participants were performing 8 repetitions of bench press at 75%1RM or, in passive intra-complex rest interval conditions, rested while seated. A significant main effect of a set to increase broad jump length (p = 0.002), countermovement jump height (p = 0.002), and modified reactive strength index (p = 0.005) was revealed, without any significant differences between conditions. Post-hoc comparisons showed a significant increase in broad jump length from baseline to Set-2 (231 ± 13 vs. 234 ± 13 cm; p = 0.003; ES = 0.22). On the other hand, countermovement jump height and modified reactive strength index significantly increased from baseline to Set-1 (34.4 ± 3.6 vs. 35.6 ± 3.9 cm; p = 0.027; ES = 0.31 and 0.4 ± 0.05 vs. 0.45 ± 0.09; p = 0.005; ES = 0.66). Results of this study showed that to sustain a high training density, sports practitioners may incorporate upper body exercises within the intra-complex rest interval during lower limb complex training sessions and still elicit a significant PAPE effect.",1
Examining the Link between Isokinetic Strength Metrics and Ball Speed in Women’s Soccer,2023-11-10,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Cengiz Ölmez, Nadhir Hammami, Büşra Yücelsoy, Soukaina Hattabi, Pedro Forte, Andrew Sortwell, Mehrzia Amani Khezami, Alparslan İnce","The shot performance of female soccer players is one of the most critical factors in winning a soccer match. It is essential to thoroughly clarify the kinetic factors that can improve shot performance. This study explores the connections between ball velocity post-shooting and isokinetic knee extension (EXT) and flexion (FLX) strength performances among female soccer players. Thirteen voluntary players from professional leagues took part in the research study. The study analyzed the average and peak concentric (Con) and eccentric (Ecc) torques, isometric (Iso) strength performances at angular velocities of 60°/s, 180°/s and 300°/s, the time required to reach peak torque, and ball velocities during shooting. The relationships among these variables were investigated separately for the dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) legs. The analysis unveiled significant correlations between ball velocities and D-EXT (Absolute) peak torque at an angular velocity of 60°/s (r = 0.597; p &lt; 0.05), D-%IPS (r = −0.580; p &lt; 0.05), and ND-FLX (Absolute) average torque (r = 0.559; p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, notable associations were observed between ball velocities and ND-EXT (Absolute) (r = 0.581; p &lt; 0.05), as well as ND-FLX (Absolute) (r = 0.602; p &lt; 0.05) average torques at an angular velocity of 180°/s. Additionally, significant relationships were found between ball velocities and peak (r = 0.664; p = 0.013) and average (r = 0.660; p = 0.014) torques generated during ND-EXT (Absolute) at an angular velocity of 300°/s. However, the connections between the time to reach peak torque, eccentric and isometric forces, and ball velocities were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). The results of the study indicate that enhancing concentric isokinetic strength development at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s angular velocities, along with balanced strengthening of the ND extremity, holds paramount importance in elevating shot performance among female soccer players, particularly in the context of rapid shot strategies.",1
Neuromuscular and perceptual-cognitive response to 4v4 small-sided game in youth soccer players,2023-11-09,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Filip Skala, Erika Zemková","The physical and psychological load of small-sided games (SSGs) can affect players' neuromuscular and cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about the acute performance changes after such a specific exercise in young soccer players and their association with exercise load applied. This study investigates i) the neuromuscular and perceptual-cognitive response to the SSG exercise load, and ii) the relationship between pre- and post-SSG changes in variables of performance and the respective exercise load in youth soccer players. Sixteen participants (13.6 ± 0.5 years) underwent a 30-min SSG 4v4 + GK protocol. Prior to and after the SSG they performed countermovement jump (CMJ), planned and reactive Y-shaped agility tests (PA, RA), and go/no-go task (GNG). Their subjective perception of fatigue was evaluated by visual analog scale. Fatigue induced by SSG (perception of fatigue increased by 41.56%, p = .001, g = 4.15) increased PA time (4.04%, p = .002, g = .97), RA time (6.45%, p = .003, g = 1.16), and number of errors in the response inhibition task (87.1%, p = .023, rc = .57), whilst decreased CMJ height (-6.65%, p = .014, g = .56). These performance deteriorations were not significantly associated with neither internal nor external load variables. However, a less pronounced drop in performance was related to external load variables, i.e., ∆CMJ height and ∆RA time correlated with very high-speed running (rs = .66, p = .006; rs = -.50, p = .022; respectively) and maximal speed (r = .54, p = .032; r = -.52, p = .037; respectively), whilst ∆PA time was associated with high-intensity accelerations (rs = -.76, p = .002). These findings indicate that fatigue induced by SSG affects both planned and reactive agility, decision-making in response inhibition task, and explosive strength in youth soccer players regardless of significant contribution of any robust internal or external load variables. Nonetheless, high-intensity actions within SSG partially compensate for the decrements in their agility performance and explosive strength. The load variables encountered during SSG do not fully reflect youth players' neuromuscular and perceptual-cognitive responses to sport-specific exercise.",1
HIGHLIGHTING THE ASPECTS OF DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE TACTICS AND THE SPECIFIC TECHNIQUE OF THE FOOTBALL GAME,2023-11-09,2023,Universitatea Dunarea de Jos din Galati,The Annals of Dunarea de Jos University of Galati Fascicle XV Physical Education and Sport Management,"Eduard Leonard Guță, Dorina Orțănescu","Football is a complex sport of teamwork and competition, a shared space whose objective is to kick the ball into the opposite goal more times than the opposition .The fact that several players share a space, fighting over possession of the ball gives the sport one of its most defining characteristics: spontaneity and, therefore, makes it more difficult to predict events. This reality is recognised by coaches and new sport professionals who understand that training environments should resemble those that are found in a real competitive contexts. As a result, Small Sided Games (SSG) have become a widely used training tool in football. SSGs are down-sized situations where one, several, or all phases of the game can be trained in a smaller space and where there are fewer players than in a real situation.",1

P. Fong, Komsak Sinsurin","Background Assessing and understanding the control of the ankle during multidirectional jump landings in athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI) would help health professionals develop interventions to reduce the risk of recurrent injuries. The aim of this study was to investigate the angle, angular velocity, and movements of the ankle joint, and the muscle activity of peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles during multidirectional landings in athletes with CAI. Methods Nineteen athletes with CAI (≤25 Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool–Thai Score) participated. A Vicon Nexus motion analysis system synchronously collected data with an AMTI force plate and surface electromyography (EMG) to capture kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity, respectively. Participants were asked to perform single-leg jump-landing tests in forward (0°), 30° diagonal, 60° diagonal, and lateral (90°) directions. Ankle joint kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity of PL, TA, and GAS were analyzed. Repeated measure ANOVA (analysis of variance) and Friedman tests were used to analyze the main effects of the jump-landing direction. Results Athletes with CAI exhibited significant differences in ankle angles, angular velocities, ankle movements, and average muscle activity of GAS between directions. Greatest average EMG of GAS muscle was observed during landing in the lateral direction compared with the forward and 30° diagonal directions. Conclusion Lateral and diagonal direction movements showed the greatest risks associated with recurrent ankle sprains. Impairments of neuromuscular control in both pre-landing and landing phases were observed in athletes with CAI when considered alongside previously published data.

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of leg and joint stiffness of the supporting leg during side-foot kicking in soccer players with CAI. Twenty-four male collegiate-level soccer players with and without CAI participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic data were obtained using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Leg stiffness and joint (hip, knee, and ankle) stiffness in the sagittal and frontal planes were calculated and analyzed. The results clarified that soccer players with CAI (0.106 ± 0.053 Nm/°) had greater knee stiffness in knee adduction during the kicking cycle compared to those without CAI (0.066 ± 0.030 Nm/°; p = 0.046), whereas no characteristic differences were observed in knee stiffness in knee flexion and hip and ankle stiffness (p &gt; 0.05). Knee stiffness is believed to occur to compensate for ankle joint instability in the supporting leg. Therefore, adjusting knee stiffness to accommodate ankle joint instability is crucial for maintaining kicking performance. Based on results of this study, it may be important to consider training and exercises focused on joint coordination to improve knee stiffness in soccer players with CAI.",1

These injuries lead to time loss, performance impairment, and long-term health concerns. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of muscle reinjuries, delving into their epidemiology, risk factors, clinical management, and prevention strategies. Despite advancements in rehabilitation programs and return-to-play criteria, reinjury rates remain alarmingly high. Age and previous muscle injuries are nonmodifiable risk factors contributing to a high reinjury rate. Clinical management, which involves accurate diagnosis, individualized rehabilitation plans, and the establishment of return-to-training and return-to-play criteria, plays a pivotal role during the sports season. Eccentric exercises, optimal loading, and training load monitoring are key elements in preventing reinjuries. The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting and preventing reinjuries offers a promising avenue, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to managing these injuries. While current strategies offer some mitigation, there is a pressing need for innovative solutions, possibly leveraging AI, to reduce the incidence of muscle reinjuries in football players. Future research should focus on this direction, aiming to enhance athletes' well-being and performance.",1

Study design: Prospective. Prospective evaluation of T2 values of ankle cartilage of 50 weightlifters (30 adults and 20 juveniles) and 100 healthy volunteers (80 adults and 20 juveniles) using Siemens 3.0 T MRI with PDWI, T1WI, and T2 mapping sequences. Three physicians manually divided the talar cartilage of the ankle joint into six regions of interest. Three physicians utilized the anterior and posterior cut edges of the tibial cartilage as markers to identify the corresponding anterior and posterior cut edges of the talar cartilage on the sagittal MRI images. The medial and lateral sides were defined as half of the talar articular surface on the coronal plane. Differences in T2 values in each cartilage region were compared using independent sample T test or Mann–Whitney U test. The T2 values of talar cartilage were significantly increased in the athlete group relative to the volunteer group (35.11 and 31.99, P &lt; 0.001), with the most significant difference observed in the juvenile athlete group compared to the volunteer group (34.42 and 28.73, P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference in the T2 value of ankle talar cartilage between weightlifters and healthy volunteers, and juveniles may be more vulnerable to overuse sports injuries.

Subjects performed a single leg drop landing (SLDL) from a plyobox. For each leg, the two-dimensional frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) was analyzed. After pretesting the shuttle run test was performed until exhaustion, before repeating the measurements.ANOVA with repeated measures was applied and identified no significance difference for the FPPA between cyclic and acyclic sports (F = 0.98, p = 0.33), a significant difference before and after fatigue (F = 12.49, p = 0.002) and no significant difference between the dominant and non dominant leg of soccer players (F = 4.35, p = 0.26).Fatigue seems to be able to have a significant influence on knee stability in the frontal axis. Therefore, fatigue should be included in motion analysis for injury prevention and return to play tests because during this physical state most injuries happen.",1

Mental fatigue impairs repeated sprint and jump performance in team sport athletes,2023-11-03,2023,Elsevier BV,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,"Walter Staiano, Luis Raimon Salazar Bonet, Marco Romagnoli, Christopher Ring","Objectives: We tested whether mental fatigue (MF), induced by a cognitively-demanding task, would impair repeated sprint ability (RSA) and repeated jump ability (RJA) performance, and whether physical fatigue and MF would impair psychomotor vigilance. Design: Randomized within-participant design. Methods: After establishing baseline peak countermovement jump (CMJ), 18 male participants performed 12 maximal 20-m (10-m linear + 10-m directional) repeated sprints (RSA random test) followed by 12 maximal repeated CMJs (RJA test) subsequent to 30-min Stroop task (MF) or a documentary (Control). Peak and mean running time and height, percent decrement score (Sdec), blood lactate, heart rate and RPE were measured for CMJ, RSA, and RJA tests. MF (M-VAS) and psychomotor vigilance [psychomotor vigilance test (PVT)] were measured at baseline, after each condition, and after the RSA/RJA tests. Results: Compared to Control, the Stroop task elevated MF (p =.001), RPE ratings (all p <.031), and mean and Sdec performance in directional (but not linear) RSA (all p <.032) and RJA tests (all p <.034). PVT score worsened after Stroop task (p =.011) but not Control, declined after RSA/RJA tests in both conditions (all p <.023) and was lower in the MF condition (p =.029). No condition differences were noted for peak (CMJ, RSA and RJA tests) performance, blood lactate, and heart rate. Conclusions: MF impairs directional RSA, and RJA performance. This impairment was linked with increased RPE and without physiological changes. The progressive impairment in PVT score suggests a cumulatively negative effect of mental and physical fatigue on psychomotor vigilance.",1

We propose a physics-based mathematical model that describes football players' movements during dribbling situations, parameterized by the attacker aggressiveness, the defender hesitance and the top speed of both players. These player- and situation-specific parameters are extracted by fitting the model to real player trajectories from Major League Soccer games, and enable the quantification of player dribbling attributes and decisions beyond classical statistics. We show that the model captures the essential dribbling dynamics, and analyze how differences between parameters in varying game situations provide valuable insights into players' behavior. Lastly, we quantitatively study how changes in the player's parameters impact dribbling performance, enabling the model to provide scientific guidance to player training, scouting and game strategy development.",1

In contact sports (the practice of American football, karate, boxing, and motor sports, among others), the reporting of this type of injury is very common. Therefore, it is imperative to have preventive measures so players do not suffer from such injuries, since bad practices or accidents can put their lives at risk. This research evaluated cervical and skull biomechanical responses during a frontal impact, taking into consideration injury caused by wear on the intervertebral disc. Intervertebral disc wear is a degenerative condition that affects human mobility; it is common in people who practice contact sports and it can influence the response of the cervical system to an impact load. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the effects caused by impact loading and strains generated throughout the bone structure (composed of the skull and the cervical spine). The numerical evaluation was developed using the finite element method and the construction of the biomodel from computational axial tomography. In addition, the numerical simulation allowed us to observe how the intervertebral disc’s wear affected the cervical region’s biomechanical response. In addition, a comparison could be made between a healthy system and a disc that had suffered wear. Finally, the analysis provided information valuable to understanding how an impact, force-related injury can be affected and enabled us to propose better physiotherapeutic procedures.",1

Published literature has reported on the unique anatomic, biomechanical, and non-surgical and surgical management strategies specific to this age group.&nbsp;A multidisciplinary committee of pediatric orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons and physical therapists from the Pediatric Research in Sports Medicine (PRISM) Knee Ligament Research Interest Group (RIG) produced this current concepts review through critical appraisal of recently published literature on the topic of pediatric knee Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) injuries. MCL injuries in young athletes have been shown to constitute a high percentage of all sports related injuries with MCL injuries. Injury assessment in this age group must include a comprehensive knee exam evaluating for associated injuries unique to developing patients. Imaging should include a 4 view knee series, stress radiographs, and alignment films to guide and follow treatment. To optimize patient outcomes, a detailed understanding of patient specific factors related to knee anatomy and biomechanics during development are essential, along with appropriate characterization and classification of injury severity. While the majority of MCL injuries in this age group can be managed non-surgically with a thoughtful approach to rehabilitation, some injuries based on clinical and radiographic assessment may benefit from surgical intervention. MCL injuries can present decision making challenges related to primary repair versus reconstruction all while restoring normal anatomy and mechanics to the knee without compromising patient growth and development. Special considerations also apply to the rehabilitation process for both non-operatively and operatively managed MCL injuries in this age group. This current concepts review was assembled by a multidisciplinary committee of pediatric sports medicine specialists to better define anatomic, clinical, and treatment applications unique to the pediatric and adolescent patient with a knee MCL injury. MCL injuries in pediatric and adolescent patients can be managed safely and effectively, but a nuanced approach is required to optimize outcomes in this unique patient population.",1
Development of a tailored concussion education program for athletes: a pragmatic multimethods design and integrated knowledge translation approach from needs assessment to design,2023-11-01,2023,BMJ,BMJ Open,"Amanda M Black, Kate Turcotte, Alex Fidanova, Karen Sadler, Samantha Bruin, Phoebe Cheng, Shazya Karmali, Taryn Taylor, Drew Halliday, Shelina Babul","Objectives To understand Canadian university athletic programme concussion management needs, and to describe development and content of a tailored online concussion education tool for Canadian university/college athletes. Design An integrated knowledge translation multiphased, multimethods approach was used. Phases included a needs assessment survey with university representatives and athletes, content selection, mapping behavioural goals to evidenced-based behaviour change techniques, script/storyboard development, engagement interviews with university athletes and tool development using user-centred design techniques. Setting Canadian U SPORTS universities (n=56). Participants Overall, 64 university representatives (eg, administrators, clinicians) and 27 varsity athletes (52% male, 48% female) completed the needs assessment survey. Five athletes participated in engagement interviews. Outcome measures Surveys assessed previous athlete concussion education, recommendations for concussion topics and tool design, concussion management challenges and interest in implementing a new course. Results Institutions used a median (Med) of two (range 1–5) approaches when educating athletes about concussion. Common approaches were classroom-style education (50%), online training (41%) and informational handouts (39%). University representatives rated most important topics as: (1) what is a concussion, (2) how to recognise a concussion and (3) how to report a concussion (Med all =4.8/5). Athletes felt symptom recognition (96%) and effects on the brain (85%) were most important. The majority of athletes preferred learning via computer (81%) and preferred to learn alone (48%) versus group learning (7%). The final resource was designed to influence four behaviours: (1) report symptoms, (2) seek care, (3) encourage teammates to report symptoms and (4) support teammates through concussion recovery. Examples of behaviour change techniques included: knowledge/skills, problem-solving scenarios, verbal persuasion and social comparison. Athletes are guided through different interactions (eg, videos, flip cards, scenarios, testimonials) to maximise engagement (material review takes ~30 min). Conclusions The Concussion Awareness Training Tool for athletes is the first Canadian education tool designed to address the needs of Canadian university/college athletes.",1
Extrasynovial ACL Tear as Potential Indicator for ACL Healing Capability: A Case Report of a Recreational Football Player With 3 Years of Serial Follow-up Tracking ACL Healing,2023-11-01,2023,Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy (JOSPT),JOSPT Cases,"Andreas Serner, Bart Sas, Pieter D’Hooghe, Javier Arnaiz","BACKGROUND: Potential structural anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) healing is receiving increased focus with several studies showing that variations of ACL healing capacities are possible. It is unknown if there are specific variations in ACL tears, which have higher probability of healing. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a successful case of nonsurgical treatment of a complete ACL injury in a 34-year-old male recreational football player that showed proposed initial magnetic resonance imaging indicators of ACL healing potential: (1) the ligament fibers of the proximal and distal ends run mostly in the same direction (no displacement of ligament stumps), (2) no significant high signal intensity surrounding the torn ACL in water sensitive sequences, and (3) absence of significant joint effusion. OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up included a series of 10 continuous magnetic resonance imaging examinations showing ACL healing progress in steps, as well as continuous clinical and biomechanical examination from injury to return to sport (4.5 months after injury) and until 3-year after injury. DISCUSSION: We propose that an extrasynovial ACL tear might be an early indicator of ACL healing capability and provide considerations and illustrations, which may assist in the detection thereof. Further investigation and validation of this theory is encouraged. JOSPT Cases 2023;3(4):212-218. Epub 13 October 2023. doi:10.2519/josptcases.2023.11747",1

Control of the body and individual body districts becomes important for both performance and injury prevention. Objective: This study aims to verify the Functional Movement Screen (FMSTM) values in different categories of players, from the youth leagues to professional soccer players. Methods: A sample of soccer players (n=112) took part in the study. The sample was subdivided according to their category, resulting in the following subgroups: a) professional soccer players (PSP, n=56,), Under 19 - Primavera (U19, n=29), Under 17 (U17, n=27). The FMS protocol was used to assess the seven functional movements and the associated risk of non-contact injury. Results: Statistically significant differences emerged in the total scores between the U17 group and the PSP group (14.8±2.9 vs 19.1±1.4, p&lt;0.01), between the U17 group and the Under 19 - Primavera group (14.8±2.9 vs 16.2±2.1, p&lt;0.05) and between the Under 19 - Primavera group and the PSP (16.2±2.1 vs 19.1±1.4, p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: The values obtained show that young soccer players have a very different qualitative control of movement than highly qualified players. This study shows significant differences not only between the total scores, but more importantly between the individual 7 assessment tests that the FMS protocol includes: these values provide insight into which movements should receive more attention in athletic conditioning in the youth sector.",1
Developmental activities of elite junior hockey players: an analysis of early sport specialization,2023-10-31,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"W. J. Garland, K. L. Smith, J. C. Dixon, S. Horton","Early sport specialization is a popular and contentious topic in the scientific literature and popular media. The lure of extrinsic rewards has led to increasing rates of specialization among young athletes, while expert recommendations promote multisport participation. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze developmental activities of a group of elite junior hockey players in Canada. Within this context, elements of specialization were investigated in accordance with existing theoretical frameworks and long-term athlete development models to enhance the literature. Fifteen participants from the Ontario Hockey League completed quantitative retrospective interviews, detailing past sport and recreational activities. Thirty-one developmental milestones were assessed. Accumulated hours of activity were categorized in accordance with Côté's (1999) Developmental Model of Sports Participation, along with the number and types of sports in which they participated during childhood. Jayanthi et al.'s (2015) continuum was utilized to determine the age at which the athletes became moderately and highly specialized. Accrued hours of deliberate practice reported by participants increased from ages 6 to 16 years, as did competition in organized hockey games. Reported hours of deliberate play peaked at 9 years of age and decreased thereafter. Participants played a combined 16 sports other than hockey, ranging from an average of 2.0 at age 6, to a maximum average of 5.6 at 12 years old, and decreasing each year to 2.3 by age 15. The greatest number of hours in other sports was accumulated at 12 years of age. Using a three-point scale, participants considered themselves ""highly specialized"" at 14 years old; however, other quantitative indicators suggested this may have occurred at 12 years of age. Relative to previous research on early sport specialization, participants in this study spent more time practicing hockey, while ceasing hockey-specific play and other sports at younger ages. Despite a diverse sport history, hockey competition was initiated earlier than recommended, showing high levels of sport commitment as young as 9 years old. The early specialization path remains a popular trajectory among coaches, parents, and athletes in Canadian ice hockey.",1

Methods Two groups of soccer players were studied, all of whom played in the Greek Super League. The ACL group included players who had suffered an ACL injury in the last 2 years. The non-ACL group was composed of players who had never suffered an ACL injury. We used a 3D baropodometric laser scanner to measure pronation or overpronation (navicular drop phenomenon) of the subtalar joint and how this affects the subtalar joint while standing. We assessed ACL laxity using the Genourob Rotab. Results ACL-injured patients, regardless of the mechanism of injury, exhibited greater navicular drop values than a randomly selected group of subjects with no history of ACL injury. Conclusion Greater knee joint laxity and subtalar pronation may be associated with an increased risk of ACL injury. Pronation of the foot appears to be a risk factor for ACL injury. These findings should be integrated into future studies to better define how neuromuscular control related to lower extremity biomechanics is associated with ACL injury.",1

Movement Asymmetries: From Their Molecular Origin to the Analysis of Movement Asymmetries in Athletes,2023-10-27,2023,MDPI AG,Life,"Alexander Egoyan, Giorgi Parulava, Steven Baker, Melinda Gilhen-Baker, Giovanni N. Roviello","Asymmetry plays a major role in biology at all scales. This can be seen in the helix of DNA, the fact that the human heart is on the left side, or that most people use their right hand. A single protein such as Myosin 1D can induce helical motion in another molecule. This causes cells, organs, and even entire bodies to twist in a domino effect, causing left–right behaviour. More generally, athlete movements are often asymmetric and, during the physical rehabilitation after injury, the asymmetry is visually discernible. Herein, we review the molecular basis of the movement asymmetries and report on the available knowledge on the few therapeutics investigated so far such as meloxicam. From a more rehabilitative perspective, it is very important to use effective methods to control the process of resolving the injury-related movement asymmetry through the complex use of specialised exercises, measurements, and gait analysis, which can all provide useful information on the effectiveness of the rehabilitation plans. If for each athlete, the normal range of asymmetry is known, the asymmetry can be individually treated and the evolution can be monitored over time. Appropriate measures should be taken if the movement asymmetry is outside this range. In addition, genetic, physiological, and psychological factors relevant to athlete health should be considered in the process of assessing and improving exercise asymmetry, which we also discuss in this review. The main proposal of this work is that the movement asymmetries in athletes should be individually treated, while taking into account the athlete’s genetics, physical condition, and previous injuries.",1

The purpose of this work was to analyze the validity, precision, and reproducibility of an algorithm to detect angulation of changes of direction (CoDs) while running, of between 45° and 180°, both to the left and the right at different speeds, in a standardized context. For this, five participants performed a total of 200 CoDs at 13 km/h and 128 CoDs at 18 km/h while wearing three inertial sensors. The information obtained from the sensors was contrasted with observation and coding using high-resolution video. Agreement between systems was assessed using Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement as well as effect size (ES) and % difference between means. Reproducibility was evaluated using the standard error (CV%). The algorithm overestimated the angulation of 90° and 135° to the right (Cohen’s d &gt; 0.91). The algorithm showed high precision when the angulations recorded at 13 km/h and 18 km/h were compared, except at 45° to the left (mean bias = −2.6°; Cohen’s d = −0.57). All angulations showed excellent reproducibility (CV &lt; 5%) except at 45° (CV = 11%), which worsened when the pre-CoD speed was 18 km/h (CV &lt; 16%).

Exploring the interplay between metabolic power and equivalent distance in training games and official matches in soccer: a machine learning approach,2023-10-24,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Physiology,"Vincenzo Manzi, Cristian Savoia, Elvira Padua, Saeid Edriss, Ferdinando Iellamo, Giuseppe Caminiti, Giuseppe Annino","Introduction: This study aimed to explore the interplay between metabolic power (MP) and equivalent distance (ED) and their respective roles in training games (TGs) and official soccer matches. Furthermore, the secondary objective was to investigate the connection between external training load (ETL), determined by the interplay of metabolic power and equivalent distance, and internal training load (ITL) assessed through HR-based methods, serving as a measure of criterion validity. Methods: Twenty-one elite professional male soccer players participated in the study. Players were monitored during 11 months of full training and overall official matches. The study used a dataset of 4269 training games and 380 official matches split into training and test sets. In terms of machine learning methods, the study applied several techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support-Vector Machine classifiers. The dataset was divided into two subsets: a training set used for model training and a test set used for evaluation. Results: Based on metabolic power and equivalent distance, the study successfully employed four machine learning methods to accurately distinguish between the two types of soccer activities: TGs and official matches. The area under the curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.90 to 0.96, demonstrating high discriminatory power, with accuracy levels ranging from 0.89 to 0.98. Furthermore, the significant correlations observed between Edwards’ training load (TL) and TL calculated from metabolic power metrics confirm the validity of these variables in assessing external training load in soccer. The correlation coefficients (r values) ranged from 0.59 to 0.87, all reaching statistical significance at p &amp;lt; 0.001. Discussion: These results underscore the critical importance of investigating the interaction between metabolic power and equivalent distance in soccer. While the overall intensity may appear similar between TGs and official matches, it is evident that underlying factors contributing to this intensity differ significantly. This highlights the necessity for more comprehensive analyses of the specific elements influencing physical effort during these activities. By addressing this fundamental aspect, this study contributes valuable insights to the field of sports science, aiding in the development of tailored training programs and strategies that can optimize player performance and reduce the risk of injuries in elite soccer.",1
"Virtual training, real effects: a narrative review on sports performance enhancement through interventions in virtual reality",2023-10-19,2023,Frontiers Media SA,Frontiers in Psychology,"Fabio Richlan, Moritz Weiß, Patrick Kastner, Jeremias Braid","The present article reports a narrative review of intervention (i.e., training) studies using Virtual Reality (VR) in sports contexts. It provides a qualitative overview and narrative summary of such studies to clarify the potential benefits of VR technology for sports performance enhancement, to extract the main characteristics of the existing studies, and to inform and guide future research. Our literature search and review eventually resulted in 12 intervention studies with a pre vs. post design focused on different sports, including target and precision sports (archery, bowling, curling, darts, golf), bat/racquet and ball sports (baseball, table tennis), goal sports (football/soccer, basketball), martial arts (karate), and sport-unspecific processes such as bodily sensations and balancing. The samples investigated in the primary studies included novice, amateur, and expert athletes (total aggregated sample size N = 493). Many studies found statistically significant effects in relevant target skills following interventions in VR, often outperforming training effects in passive or active control conditions (e.g., using conventional training protocols). Therefore, interventions in VR (or extended reality) have the potential to elicit real effects in sports performance enhancement through training of motor and psychological skills and capabilities in athletes, including perception-action skills, strategic, tactical and decision-making, responding to unexpected events, and enhancing psychological resilience and mental performance under pressure. The neurocognitive mechanisms (e.g., visual search behavior, imagery), methodological aspects (e.g., adaptive training difficulty), and the issues of real-world transfer and generalizability via which these potential sports-performance-related improvements may occur are discussed. Finally, limitations of the present review, the included studies, the current state of the field in general as well as an outlook and future perspectives for research designs and directions are taken into consideration.",1

Plus/minus (PM) metrics provide a practical and objective approach to player performance assessment and are commonly used in other sports. This study aimed to quantify and compare individual player performance variations in elite football league players who sustained ATRs and returned to play within 1 year compared to those without ATRs, using a PM metric.Player and team data were sourced from Transfermarkt.com. Male players sustaining ATRs between 2007 and 2018 were identified through injury reports. A control group (CTRL) was matched by position, age, height, and league, with a 6:1 ratio of controls to ATR subjects. The day of injury was considered ""time zero"". Year -1 corresponds to the 360 days preceding injury, and Year 1 to the interval between 360 and 720 days after. Performance in the player's main team was evaluated using a previously validated weighted PM metric. Only data from Year -1 and Year 1 were used for ATR versus CTRL group comparisons. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The ATR group included 125 athletes. Data from more than 76,000 matches were analyzed. No statistically significant differences in net weighted PM metric between Year -1 and Year 1 were found.No differences were found between athletes suffering from ATRs and controls regarding the weighted PM metric.III.",1
Ergonomic Sports Mouthguards: A Narrative Literature Review and Future Perspectives,2023-10-16,2023,MDPI AG,Applied Sciences,"Talita Suelen De Queiroz, Beatriz Serralheiro da Cruz, Amir Mohidin Mohamed Demachkia, Alexandre Luiz Souto Borges, João Paulo Mendes Tribst, Tarcisio José de Arruda Paes Junior","Sports activities can increase participants’ risk of orofacial trauma. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of various types of sports mouthguards. This study aims to present a narrative literature review on ergonomic mouthguards, including their indications for use, classifications, materials, manufacturing methods, and the current status of additive manufacturing in their production. Research of the existing literature was performed in the Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases to identify the currently available publications on the topic of sports mouthguards from January 1951 to August 2023. The terms used were “sports mouthguard”, “mouthguards and orofacial traumas”, and “mouthguards and additive manufacturing”. A total of 920 articles were found, and 39 articles were selected and included in this review. While consensus exists regarding the significance of using sports mouthguards with optimal attributes, there is a need for standardization in the methodology for manufacturing custom-made mouthguards. These can be fashioned with conventional ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer reinforcements. Such standardization would ensure uniform stress distribution and guarantee ample protection for oral tissues, allowing for universal reproducibility among dental practitioners. Additive manufacturing stands as an innovative method for fabricating mouthguards, displaying promising benefits. However, the materials and methodologies employed in this workflow still require refinement and characterization for a safe clinical integration.",1
Effect of sportswear on performance and physiological heat strain during prolonged running in moderately hot conditions,2023-10-15,2023,Wiley,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports,"Leonidas G. Ioannou, Lydia Tsoutsoubi, Paraskevi Gkiata, Harry A. Brown, Julien D. Periard, Igor B. Mekjavic, Glen P. Kenny, Lars Nybo, Andreas D. Flouris","Introduction: This study examined the impact of different upper-torso sportswear technologies on the performance and physiological heat strain of well-trained and national-level athletes during prolonged running in moderately hot conditions. Methods: A randomized crossover design was employed in which 20 well-trained (n = 16) and national-level (n = 4) athletes completed four experimental trials in moderately hot conditions (35°C, 30% relative humidity). In each trial, participants ran at 70% of their peak oxygen uptake (70% V̇O2peak) for 60 min, while wearing a different upper-body garment: cotton t-shirt, t-shirt with sweat-wicking fabric, compression t-shirt, and t-shirt with aluminum dots lining the inside of the upper back of the garment. Running speed was adjusted to elicit the predetermined oxygen consumption associated with 70% V̇O2peak. Physiological (core and skin temperatures, total body water loss, and urine specific gravity) and perceptual (thermal comfort and sensation, ratings of perceived exertion, and garment cooling functionality) parameters along with running speed at 70% V̇O2peak were continuously recorded. Results: No significant differences were observed between the four garments for running speed at 70% V̇O2peak, physiological heat strain, and perceptual responses (all p > 0.05). The tested athletes reported larger areas of perceived suboptimal cooling functionality in the cotton t-shirt and the t-shirt with aluminum dots relative to the sweat-wicking and compression t-shirts (d: 0.43–0.52). Conclusion: There were not differences among the tested garments regarding running speed at 70% V̇O2peak, physiological heat strain, and perceptual responses in well-trained and national-level endurance athletes exercising in moderate heat.",1
Evaluation of Kinematic and Kinetic Variables After Knee Joint Surgery Before and After 8 Weeks of Individual Training (Case Study),2023-10-14,2023,Science Publishing Group,Education Journal,"Ali Fattahi, Behshad Panjehzadeh","The knee joint is one of the largest joints in the human body that, like all other joints in the body, is affected by defects, injuries and disease processes. The aim of this study was to identify the source of injury, to provide the best way to return to group training and play after knee joint surgery. This case study on a patient with a male gender, age 35 years, right upper leg, futsal sport with inclusion criteria having a history of surgery 3 times on the right knee (ACL, MCL, ALL, external and internal meniscus), Based on the analysis and performance tests, (curve tracking, squat, squat jump, body sway). The increase of the invertor / ankle evertor at the peak of pronation on the left side was excessive and gait pattern was asymmetric, according to the comparison of balance assessments Static and dynamic were observed between the balance in the right and left legs in the body sway test, the rate of balance in the body in the lateral (medial-lateral) direction was not the same (14.63%). The amount of control force in the left foot was more than the right foot, balance in the closed eye position in the right leg is less than the open eye position, control force in the left leg is more than the right leg, productive force on the left and right legs was almost the same. Conclusion, one-legged balance exercises for both sides, deep sensory strengthening of the knee and ankle (especially on the right side) and quadriceps and plantarflexor muscles are recommended. dynamic and static balance, especially in the medial-lateral direction, needs rehabilitation and improvement. The exercises, closed movement chain training techniques, balance, eccentric exercises with high repetition and low resistance, and facilitation of reflexes by reactionary exercises are suggested, respectively.",1
