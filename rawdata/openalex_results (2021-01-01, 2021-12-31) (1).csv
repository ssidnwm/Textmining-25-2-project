Material and methods: ‪‪Fifty-six adolescent athletes were included in the study. The athletes’ trunk, hip, and hamstring flexibility were evaluated with the SR test (traditional). The height-relative SR, leg length-relative SR and trunk length-relative SR test values were calculated by proportioning each data with the SR test values. Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis were used according to the distribution status. Statistical significance was taken as p&lt;0.05. Results: There was a very strong positive correlation between the traditional SR and all relative SR in female and male athletes (r:0.991/0.996; p&lt;0.05). Traditional values of SR flexibility were similar between genders; however, relative SR according to the height, the trunk length, and the leg length were found to be higher in female athletes. Conclusions: ‪We think that the height-relative SR, leg length-relative SR and trunk length-relative SR values will give more accurate results in comparing trunk, hip, and hamstring flexibility. Therefore, we suggest that flexibility should be evaluated with relative SR tests, and its practical use should be increased."

MATERIALS AND METHODSFifty-two patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with ToggleLoc device were reviewed for peroperative lateral femoral cortical burst complication.The relation between lateral femoral cortical burst and tunnel position on lateral femoral cortex (condylar-epicondylar) was investigated from patients' records.A case-based analysis was done.Preoperative and postoperative Lysholm scores were also noted. RESULTSPeroperative lateral femoral cortical burst complication was observed in four of 52 patients.In five of the 52 cases, ToggleLoc button was placed over the condylar region, and four of the cases with condylar button placement had the complication.The mean preoperative and postoperative Lysholm scores were 37.98 (min: 26, max: 62) and 91.73 (min: 81, max: 100), respectively. CONCLUSIONToggleLoc button structure and distal loading of tensioning sutures cause increased risk of lateral femoral cortical burst during ACL reconstruction.As a precaution, condylar placement of the femoral tunnel lateral cortical aperture should be avoided."

The aim of the presented article is to point out the effectiveness of movement therapy for the correction of the pelvic position and subsequent adjustment of the body posture, which is evaluated by a change in the distribution of plantar pressures as well as the position of the center of gravity projection. Observations were made on three subjects who reported pain in different areas of the body as a result of incorrect body posture. Input and control measurements were performed on a baropodometer, and Neurac movement therapy in the Redcord system was applied between the individual measurements. The individual exercises were chosen specifically with regard to affect the specific muscle groups. After evaluating the measured data, it can be stated that the selected movement therapy has a significant effect on the correction of pathophysiological position, which is also demonstrated by changing the distribution of plantar pressures, adjusting the position of the center of gravity projection and also significantly eliminating painful symptoms and increasing movement comfort."

Physical performance demands, such as cutting, hopping, and landing, involved with certain sport participation suggests that the rehabilitation needs of an athlete after LAS may differ from those of the general population.To review the literature to determine the most effective rehabilitation interventions reported for athletes returning to sport after acute LAS.Data Sources: Databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and PEDro were searched to July 2020.A scoping review protocol was developed and followed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines and registered (https://osf.io/bgek3/). Study selection included published articles on rehabilitation for ankle sprain in an athletic population.Parameters included athlete and sport type, age, sex, intervention investigated, outcome measures, measurement tool, and follow-up period.A qualitative synthesis for all articles was undertaken, and a quantitative subanalysis of randomized controlled trials and critical methodological appraisal was also conducted.A total of 37 articles were included in this review consisting of 5 systematic and 20 narrative reviews, 7 randomized controlled trials, a single-case series, case report, position statement, critically appraised topic, and descriptive study. Randomized controlled trial interventions included early dynamic training, electrotherapy, and hydrotherapy.Early dynamic training after acute LAS in athletes results in a shorter time to return to sport, increased functional performance, and decreased self-reported reinjury. The results of this scoping review support an early functional and dynamic rehabilitation approach when compared to passive interventions for athletes returning to sport after LAS. Despite existing research on rehabilitation of LAS in the general population, a lack of evidence exists related to athletes seeking to return to sport."

Even though clinical screenings aiming at identifying subjects at risk of injuries are gaining popularity, the use of sophisticated equipment still represents a barrier towards their widespread use. This study aimed to test both reliability and repeatability of a new methodology to assess lower limb joints kinematics and kinetics directly on field with the aid of video cameras and plantar pressure insoles. Ten athletes and one case study (post ACL surgery) were assessed in a gait laboratory, while performing double leg squats, through the simultaneous acquisition of stereophotogrammetry, force plates, commercial video cameras and plantar pressure insoles. Different sources of errors were investigated and both reliability and repeatability analysis performed. Minimum and maximum RMSE values of 0.74% (right knee joint center trajectory) and 64.51%, respectively (ankle dorsi-plantarflexion moment), were detected. Excellent to good correlation was found for the majority of the measures, even though very poor and inverse between-trials correlation was found on a restricted number of trials especially for the ankle dorsi-plantarflexion moment. These findings could be used in combination with already available screening tools in order to provide more repeatable results."
https://openalex.org/W4226315221,,2021-12-30,2021,paratext,"The development and practice of shooting skills in football often involves the use of stationary defenders and inanimate equipment.Previous research has focused on the biomechanical, physiological and psychological aspects of shooting, with less attention being applied to the ecology of shooting within the performance environment.The aim of this study was to identify and analyse Euro 2020 goal scorers' perception of defender proximity between the moment of the assist pass and the finish to offer guidance to coaches when designing shooting practice drills.Using an observation approach, goals scored by one-and two-touch finish (n=67) were analysed.Data collected were the proximity changes between goal scorer and defenders at the moment of the assist pass and finish.Proximity zones were based on the goal scorer's ability to take one, two, or three or more touches before shooting.Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability scores for the observation approach were high.340 defender positions were analysed using dependent samples t-test and results revealed the proximity between goal scorer and defenders to significantly change between the moment of assist pass and finish if the defenders were within a closer proximity.Defender proximity changes outside of a two-touch zone for the goal scorer showed to have no significant impact.Data suggest that the use of stationary defender positions or inanimate equipment may not be effective when performing shooting practice drills due to the proximity changes the goal scorer will experience in the performance environment.Results showed all goals were scored from central pitch positions from assist passes in both central and wide areas.Practical implications are offered to guide coaches in practice drill design to create an ecologically dynamic environment where defenders change position between the moment of assist pass and finish."
https://openalex.org/W4205341392,Reliability of the Hip Extension Lower Exercise as a Measure of Eccentric Hamstring Strength,2021-12-30,2021,article,"Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is a very common lower-body injury in field sports, and eccentric (ECC) hamstring strength is a potential modifiable risk factor, therefore having reliable eccentric hamstring strength assessments is critical. The aim of this study was to access test–retest reliability of the hip extension lower (HEL) exercise as a measure of ECC hamstring strength and inter-limb asymmetries. Twelve male elite level soccer players (mean; age: 21.8 years; height: 180.4 cm; weight: 75.7 kg) volunteered to participate in this study. Participants were from the same soccer club, covered all playing positions, and had no current injury issues. Participants performed two familiarization sessions to acquaint themselves with the device and exercise protocol. During testing, each participant performed three repetitions with 60s intra-set recovery provided. Average and peak force (N) was recorded for both limbs. Testing sessions took place on the same day and time over a two-week pre-season period and followed a full recovery day. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Coefficient of Variation (CV%), Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) and Typical Error (TE) were used to assess reliability. The HEL showed excellent reliability for average force (N) in the left (ICC (95% CI) = 0.9 (0.7–0.97); TE = 14.1 N, CV% = 1.87; MDC = 39.06 N) and right (ICC (95% CI) = 0.91 (0.73–0.97); TE = 20.89 N, CV% = 3.26; MDC = 57.87 N) limb, and also excellent reliability for peak force in the left (ICC (95% CI) = 0.91 (0.71–0.97); TE = 13.55 N, CV% = 1.61; MDC = 57.87 N) and right (ICC (95% CI) = 0.9 (0.7–0.97); TE = 21.70 N, CV% = 3.31; MDC = 60.11 N) limb. This data suggests the HEL as a reliable measure of both ECC hamstring strength and inter-limb asymmetries. Practitioners should consider the HEL as a reliable choice for measuring and monitoring eccentric hamstring strength in their athletes."
https://openalex.org/W4200073770,Examining the Relationship Between a Neuromuscular Control Baseline Battery for Sport-Related Concussion and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk,2021-12-30,2021,article,"To examine the relationship between the m-CTSIB and Landing Error Scoring System in a sample of collegiate female athletes.Recent literature has linked concussion and neuromuscular deficits in the lower extremity after injury. Neuromuscular control is frequently assessed using balance measures for concussion, but also dynamically to identify anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) risk via jump-landing movement screening.Thirty-nine healthy, collegiate female soccer (n = 22) and volleyball (n = 17) athletes completed the modified-Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction of Balance (m-CTSIB) and the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS). Measures consisted of total m-CTSIB sway index scores on individual conditions (firm surface eyes open [condition 1] and eyes closed [2], foam surface eyes open [3] and eyes closed [4]), m-CTSIB overall score, and total LESS errors. LESS scores were also categorized into a low (0-4 errors) and high (5 + errors) risk to determine if athletes with worse neuromuscular control on the LESS has worse balance on the m-CTSIB. A Spearman's rank-order correlation was conducted to determine the strength of the relationship between LESS and m-CTSIB performance. A series of Mann-Whitney U test were performed to determine differences between low and high LESS performance on m-CTSIB performance.There was a weak, negative correlation between LESS and m-CTSIB performance (rs(37) = -0.153, p = 0.35). Further, there were no differences between the low and high risk LESS groups on sway index scores on conditions 1 (U = 158.5, p = 0.39), 2 (U = 156.0, p = 0.36), 3 (U = 165.5, p = 0.51), or 4 (U = 128.5, p = 0.08), as well as overall m-CTSIB scores (U = 150.5, p = 0.28).There appears to be a lack of relationship between the LESS and m-CTSIB tests, revealing the independence of static and dynamic lower extremity neuromuscular function. Athletes who may be more at risk for ACL injury due to abnormal jump-landing biomechanics, do not differ from low-risk athletes on baseline balance assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4213284077,"Intrusiveness in professional and world tour road cycling: the “Troy horse” playing the role of coaches, head of performance, or sport science professionals",2021-12-30,2021,article,"Cycling is nowadays much better considered than one or two decades ago, after all the doping scandals reached their highest level with Lance Armstrong case (Zabala, 2017). This was called a necessary tsunami that would hurt both some good things but also and mainly really bad things like the doping culture. But before “Armstrong” case, we found “Festina” case in 1998 and later “Puerto” case in Spain in 2006. As Morente-Sánchez and Zabala (2013) pointed out, “Puerto” case was an inflection point in terms of letting all the people know (from cycling world to spectators, sponsors etc) that doping culture was taken as a shame, worse that just cheating. So, the rules were clear for everybody. Then antidoping rules and actions were strictly applied: Whereabouts, biological passport, “no needle policy”… and the creation of organizations as “Movement for a credible cycling” or “Clean cycling” to which different world tour and pro teams were affiliated (not all of them because self-obliged restrictions were sometimes hard to achieve or so believed some managers of important cycling teams). After many years of public punishment, and after suffering “Armstrong” case, cycling seemed to learn from its own mistakes (Morente-Sánchez and Zabala, 2014). Of course, other sports were not “angels”, but cycling was the most exposed sport of all of them. “Fancy bear” hackers club revealed different cases of doping among numerous sports like athletics, gymnastics, football… and a shameful use of the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) politics in favour of very famous and outstanding athletes. Then more actions like banning substances like Tramadol were driven, even if science still suggests that this is not a problem for athletes nowadays as it does not affect negatively cognitive processes and so it cannot be assumed that it could create massive crashes in the peloton (Zandonai et al., 2021), as it is wrongly suggested by some badly documented journalists. Anyway, the most important action was taken by the International Cycling Union (UCI) when they forced the world tour teams to contract coaches and specifically banning doctors to play a role as coaches or being related to the training process. This was called “organizational criterion”, and all the world tour teams must achieve this criterion (as for example the economical criteria) so they could get or maintain the world tour licence (Zabala, 2017).We are not here to talk about this dark past that, by the way, we must know to never forget. We are here to recognize the positive steps that were made, and also to warn about the “Troy horse” that could spoil all these positive advances: this is the attitude that boosted cheating culture in the past that, may be arising again using a different shape. Yes, we are warning about those people that were cheaters in the past and are trying to cheat nowadays. Those are mainly ex-cyclist who were sanctioned for doping and nowadays without the appropriate formation and studies are involved in pro or world tour teams, as well as coaching pro cyclists individually. Also, there are some coaches that are not prepared for such a job, but they are good friends of someone that decides in the team, or pseudo -nutritionist, -biomechanics… and it is said that some banned professionals involved in “Armstrong” case are still coaching in the shadow professional riders.We could “speak louder” but we could not “speak more clearly”. There are different kind of cheaters: those that were objectively dopers-cheaters in the past that are now playing a professional role to which they are not accredited, and those that are just cheating nowadays playing their professional role without the appropriate tittle. We must stand out those that do not own a sport science degree to play the role of a coach for professional athletes or, more obviously, to play the role of a “head of performance” or “sport scientist”. Also, for example, those that work as nutritionists not owning the specific tittle to be working on such a role. Can anyone imagine a doctor with no tittle working in any institution or company? What a paradox! Doctors in the team are banned to take part in cyclists’ training process but someone with no preparation can do it.Maybe the most important aim of this journal is to boost science to be a practical and useful part of professional sport, appealing to the “2.0 cycling”: the integrative, fair and transparent cycling. This was the first editorial of the Journal of science and cycling 10 years ago in 2012 when the journal was launched (Zabala and Atkinson, 2012). Many things have been improved since then, so that we are convinced that cycling is nowadays the cleaner elite sport in the world. But we cannot get slept, we must seek for the highest standards not just for the elite cycling but also for the amateur (Zabala et al., 2016; Fincoeur et al., 2020). Then, we must recognize the “Troy horse” so we can fight it properly. More responsibility and more ethics maybe from those that make the contracts not asking for the necessary tittle? Yes, may be the intruders exist because some managers and CEOs allow them this existence. So let’s be cautious… Troy was conquered, and professional road cycling could be seriously injured again"

Back then, it was only employed in track and field events and was known as “jump training.” The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of plyometric and strength trainings on selected physical fitness variables in Ethiopia Youth Sport Academy female soccer players. The study used quasi-experimental design. Random sampling technique was used to group the participants into plyometric and strength training groups. Both groups performed selected exercises for consecutive twelve weeks, implemented two days per week and two hours in each session. Paired sample t-test and independent t-test were conducted to analyze the change scores from pre and posttest for all subjects and from separated groups. The paired sample t-test results revealed that players in the plyometric group significantly improved their agility (p&lt;0.05) and explosive power performance (p&lt;0.05) from baseline to the end of the intervention. Whereas, female soccer players in the strength group only improved their explosive power (p&lt;0.05) following twelve-week of strength training intervention. As the independent sample t-test result identified no significant performance difference in agility (p&gt;0.05) and explosive power (p&gt;0.05) performances between the groups. In general, following twelve-week of continuous plyometric and strength trainings the study identified that both training interventions improved the agility and explosive power ability of female soccer players and no significant performance differences had been identified between the two groups."
https://openalex.org/W4206927092,Defining Training and Performance Caliber: A Participant Classification Framework,2021-12-29,2021,article,"Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term ""elite"" subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices."

This study is aimed at investigating the effects of differential learning (DL) and the elements of OPTIMAL theory on learning a goal-kicking skill in futsal, especially under the conditions of external and internal foci. (2) Methods: A total of 40 female beginners were randomly assigned to, and equally distributed among, five different interventions. Within a pretest and post-test design, with retention and transfer tests, participants practiced for 12 weeks, involving two 20-min sessions per week. The tests involved a kicking skill test. Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. (3) Results: Statistically significant differences with large effect sizes were found between differential learning (DL) with an external focus, DL with an internal focus, DL with no focus, traditional training with an external focus, and traditional training with control groups in the post-, retention, and transfer tests. (4) Conclusions: The results indicate the clear advantages of DL. It is well worth putting further efforts into investigating a more differentiated application of instructions combined with exercises for DL."

Eight male semi-professional football players took part in the study and filled a questionnaire about their activity during the lockdown. At the resumption of activities, the mean heart rate and covered distances during fatiguing exercises, the normalized variations of mean and maximum exerted power in the Wingate test and the Bosco test outcomes (i.e., maximum height, mean exerted power, relative strength index, leg stiffness, contact time, and flight time) were measured for one month. Questionnaires confirmed a light-intensity self-administered physical activity. A significant effect of fatigue (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p < 0.05) on measured variables was confirmed for the four weeks. The analysis of the normalized variations of the aforementioned parameters allowed the distinguishing of two behaviors: downfall in the first two weeks, and recovery in the last two weeks. Instrumental results suggest a physiological and ballistic (i.e., Bosco test outcomes) recovery after four weeks. As concerns the explosive skills, the observational data are insufficient to show complete recovery."

However, evidence shows that tendinopathy can significantly impact the professional careers of the affected athletes. The main clinical features of the condition include decreased performance and strength of the affected tendons, swelling, and localized pain. Although tendinopathy might seem a non-critical condition, estimates show that it might be career-ending for many professional athletes, and therefore, reducing their quality of life. In the present literature review, we have discussed the epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis of tendinopathy among athletes. Different intrinsic and extrinsic factors were found to contribute to the development of the condition and the impact of various systemic diseases. Evidence also shows that the prevalence of the condition is high among athletes. However, these rates were variable across the different studies in the literature. This is probably owing to various factors, like demographics and the process of detection. The pathogenesis of the condition is also very complicated, and the development of pain has been attributed to the process of angiogenesis and associated ingrowth of nerve fibers."
https://openalex.org/W4206022039,"Predictive Analytic Techniques to Identify Hidden Relationships between Training Load, Fatigue and Muscle Strains in Young Soccer Players",2021-12-24,2021,article,"This study aimed to analyze different predictive analytic techniques to forecast the risk of muscle strain injuries (MSI) in youth soccer based on training load data. Twenty-two young soccer players (age: 13.5 ± 0.3 years) were recruited, and an injury surveillance system was applied to record all MSI during the season. Anthropometric data, predicted age at peak height velocity, and skeletal age were collected. The session-RPE method was daily employed to quantify internal training/match load, and monotony, strain, and cumulative load over the weeks were calculated. A countermovement jump (CMJ) test was submitted before and after each training/match to quantify players’ neuromuscular fatigue. All these data were used to predict the risk of MSI through different data mining models: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among them, SVM showed the best predictive ability (area under the curve = 0.84 ± 0.05). Then, Decision tree (DT) algorithm was employed to understand the interactions identified by the SVM model. The rules extracted by DT revealed how the risk of injury could change according to players’ maturity status, neuromuscular fatigue, anthropometric factors, higher workloads, and low recovery status. This approach allowed to identify MSI and the underlying risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4200238199,Efficacy of Prophylactic Knee Bracing in Sports,2021-12-24,2021,article,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries are common knee injuries, which can result from contact and noncontact during sports, recreation, or work-related activities. Prophylactic knee braces (PKBs) have been designed to protect the knee and decrease risk of recurrence of these injuries. Despite their success, PKBs have not been proven to be consistently effective and cost of the device must be evaluated to optimize its use in sports, particularly American football. Biomechanical studies have suggested that increased hip and knee flexion angles may reduce frontal plane loading with bracing which can protect the knee joint. This is essential with knee loading and rotational moments because they are associated with jumping, landing, and pivoting movements. The clinical efficacy of wearing PKBs can have an impact on athletic performance with respect to speed, power, motion, and agility, and these limitations are evident in athletes who are unaccustomed to wearing a PKB. Despite these concerns, use of PKBs increases in patients who have sustained an MCL injury or recovering from an ACL reconstruction surgery. As the evidence continues to evolve in sports medicine, there is limited definitive data to determine their beneficial or detrimental effects on overall injury risk of athletes, therefore leading those recommendations and decisions for their usage in the hands of the athletic trainers and team physicians' experience to determine the specific brace design, brand, fit, and situations for use."
https://openalex.org/W4200427286,Treatment of Navicular Stress Fracture Accompanied by Os Supranaviculare: A Case Report,2021-12-24,2021,article,"Navicular stress fractures (NSFs) are relatively uncommon, and predominantly affect athletes. Patients complain of vague pain, bruising, and swelling in the dorsal aspect of the midfoot. Os supranaviculare (OSSN) is an accessory ossicle located above the dorsal aspect of the talonavicular joint. There have been few previous reports of NSFs accompanied by OSSN. Herein we report the case of a patient with OSSN who was successfully treated for an NSF. A 34-year-old Asian man presented with a 6-month history of insidious-onset dorsal foot pain that occasionally radiated medially toward the arch. The pain worsened while sprinting and kicking a soccer ball with the instep, whereas it was temporarily relieved by rest for a week and analgesics. Plain radiographs of the weight-bearing foot and ankle joints revealed a bilateral, well-corticated OSSN. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a sagittally oriented incomplete fracture that extended from the dorsoproximal cortex to the center of the body of the navicular. The OSSN was excised and the joint was immobilized with a non-weight-bearing cast for 6 weeks, followed by gradual weight bearing using a boot. The 5-month follow-up CT scan demonstrated definite fracture healing. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient's symptoms had resolved, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score had improved from 61 to 95 points, and the visual analog scale pain score had improved from 6 to 0. We describe a rare case of NSF accompanied by OSSN. Because of the fracture gap and biomechanical properties of OSSN, OSSN was excised and the joint was immobilized, leading to a successful outcome. Further research is required to evaluate the relationship between NSFs and OSSN, and determine the optimal management of NSFs in patients with OSSN."
https://openalex.org/W4205804541,Different change of direction tests assess different physical ability parameters: Principal component analysis of nine change of direction tests,2021-12-24,2021,article,"Change of direction (CoD) ability is critical for the success of athletes in many sports. The purpose of this study was to perform a principal component analysis using 9 CoD tests in order to reveal possible subcomponents of CoD ability, which could aid practitioners in test selection. Male and female kinesiology students (n = 76) performed all CoD tests and a 30-m sprint test in a quasi-randomized, counterbalanced order. Three components for males and two components for females were extracted from principle component analysis (variance explained = 82.3 and 71.4%, respectively). It seems that the CoD test should be subdivided into at least two components: a) “pure CoD tests” (such as 505 test, T-test and 180° turn) and maneuverability tests (such as AFL run, Illinois test and Figure of Eight test). Considering that different factors seem to underlie CoD and maneuverability, our findings have important practical implications for training design. If hopping/jumping CoD is important for a given athlete, it should also be tested separately."

Every sport has patterns of injury that are determined by the unique stresses experienced by those athletes. Evaluating these patterns of injuries and the mechanisms that are associated with them can lead to injury-prevention strategies and the development of effective protective equipment. The use of knee braces in football linemen [1, 10] and protective gloves in baseball players [3] as a way to avoid hand injuries while sliding into a base are examples of researchers mining injury data to decrease injury in a particular sport. But in some instances, protective equipment may not function as desired and may lead to new problems. For example, previous research [8] has suggested that wrist guards may result in a transfer of stress to the forearm and increase the chances of forearm fractures. Additionally, studies on skiing and snowboarding injuries [2, 6] indicate that although they are similar, each sport is associated with different rates of injury. In this context, corroboration of previous findings is especially important to assure that unique factors in previous datasets (such as the differences between snow conditions in the Rockies and the Appalachians) did not influence the results. There currently are no good data on the incidence of forearm injuries or their surrounding circumstances associated with skiing. The retrospective study by Twining et al. [11] attempts to fill that gap in knowledge. The authors evaluated a database of 40 years' worth of injuries at one ski slope in the Northeast United States to determine the frequency and types of diaphyseal forearm fractures and the factors associated with those injuries. They found that wrist guards did not increase the incidence of forearm fractures, although their research did not comment on whether they were of any benefit. One of the important findings of this study is that often skiiers are injured by collisions with other skiers when they are standing still. Physicians may help their patients most by pointing out the importance of being aware of other skiers when on the slopes. Where Do We Need To Go? Epidemiologic studies such as this one attempt to find patterns of injuries and factors associated with them under the theory that better understanding of the actual mechanics associated with the injury will allow the development of mitigation strategies to decrease their incidence. But the challenge for Twining et al. [11] was the fact that they selected a rare injury, such that even with 40 years of data, the numbers remain small. The incidence of forearm fractures among skiers was 0.004 per 1000 person-days, and among snowboarders it was 0.03 per 1000 person-days. Based on the study data, this is a very small percentage of the injuries seen on the ski slopes during this period (< 1% to 2%), and once they began looking at subgroups, problems of statistical power and what the authors called ""statistical fragility"" came up. Underpowering results in a limited ability to find differences that are present when making comparisons, and fragility means that the detection of a few more (or fewer) events could result in a change in a key finding. The obvious solution to both problems would be an experimental design that yielded a larger number of events for analysis; this could be obtained by pooling data from multiple ski slopes. Additionally, Twining and colleagues [11] are sitting on a huge database of other injuries, which can be mined for the evaluation of more common injuries such as ACL tears and tibial fractures [7]. Future studies should evaluate those injuries, which are more common in skiing and which may be adequately supported by data from just one ski slope. Another challenge the authors faced relates to the evolution of equipment that has occurred over 40 years. The evolution of ski equipment affects how people ski and likely has changed the incidence of injuries. Given the longitudinal nature of this database, future studies could consider the effect changes in boot and binding technology had, if any, on lower extremity injuries on their ski slopes. Finally, these authors clearly show that wrist guards do not increase the incidence of forearm fractures in skiers, but we still need to identify a piece of protective equipment that could possibly protect against forearm fractures. How Do We Get There? These authors have successfully answered the question regarding whether wrist guards increase the risk of forearm fractures, but some of the unusual findings in their dataset—including injuries occurring more often when standing still than when going fast or that they were more common on the easy slopes rather than the more challenging ones—may have been a function of the statistical fragility encountered because of the low incidence of forearm injuries. The solution to this problem, as I alluded to earlier, is more data, which could be obtained by pooling data from multiple ski slopes. A larger governing body to oversee such data consolidation and evaluation may be necessary, perhaps through the US Ski Association or a national orthopaedic association such as those for hand or sports medicine injuries. Currently, data are typically reported from hospitals or National Trauma Registry [9, 12] but not from individual slopes. Data pooling from multiple ski slopes will enhance the power of these data. It is possible that other ski slopes have similar databases and are unaware of the fact that similar data collection philosophies have been followed at ski slopes elsewhere. Collaboration between these ski slopes could immediately result in improvement in data analysis and management of injuries. These authors obviously had an interest in forearm fractures and may focus their practice in the upper extremity. Sharing this with their colleagues who manage lower extremity injuries or closed head injuries would allow extraction of even more information from the available data set. Depending on the length of time the data have been collected, both longitudinal studies and studies utilizing current data could produce meaningful results. Multiple studies on ski boots, bindings, and helmets have been produced over the past several decades [4, 5], but subtle changes in equipment can be evaluated through databases such as these. For studies seeking to evaluate the development of protective equipment, such research may require partnering with industry. Industry partnership for safety equipment and sports is complex and has ramifications in terms of both liability and profitability for companies. Despite this, extensive research has been performed in other areas including knee braces, football helmets, and helmets used for bicycle riding and skiing. Biomechanical data taken from the laboratory must be tested in the field, and databases such as this would be ideal to quantify the improvements in participant safety with modifications in equipment. Again, the longitudinal nature of databases such as this would be beneficial in creating a comparison group for changes in safety equipment design."

Validity of session rating of perceived exertion for measuring training load in youth team handball players. J Strength Cond Res 37(1): 174-180, 2023-Session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) is a subjective self-reported measure of training load and is a popular method in several different team sports. This study aimed to investigate the validity of sRPE, by correlating sRPE load (sRPE × minutes of training) and heart rate (HR) expressed as Edwards Summated Heart Rate Zones (SHRZ) and PlayerLoad among Danish youth team handball players. Second, the study aimed to investigate sRPE load's ability to descriptively differentiate between a low and a high training load category. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in the in-season period. Fourteen training sessions were measured from 6 teams, in which PlayerLoad, Edwards SHRZ, and sRPE load were measured for the training session and collected from 47 subjects (23 males and 24 females). Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between sRPE load and Edwards SHRZ and PlayerLoad. Furthermore, a high and a low load category were made from PlayerLoad or Edwards SHRZ to investigate sRPE load's ability to discriminate between high and low objective load. Large correlations between sRPE load and Edwards SHRZ (0.52 [95% CI 0.27:0.70]) and between sRPE load and PlayerLoad (0.67 [95% CI 0.47:0.80]) were observed. Our findings further indicate that sRPE load can differentiate between a high and a low training load category in both Edwards SHRZ and PlayerLoad. Our results show that sRPE load reflects both internal and external load during team handball training sessions and seems to discriminate between high- and low-intensity training sessions. These results support the validity of sRPE load for measuring training load in young team handball players."

Smaller (<8.5 cm2) lumbar multifidus at the fifth vertebra (LM L5) and larger (>8.2 cm2) quadratus lumborum (QL) cross-sectional area (CSA) have been associated with increased noncontact lower limb injury risk in AFL players. These associations have not been explored in an NRL cohort. This study will attempt to replicate previous research findings by confirming that muscle morphology is associated with noncontact lower limb injury.AFL (n = 87) and NRL (n = 151) players underwent LM L2-L5 and QL CSA ultrasound measures during preseason. Each club's medical staff reported all noncontact lower limb injuries sustained in the subsequent regular season. LM and QL CSA, age, body mass index, and noncontact lower limb injuries were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Seventy-two players sustained a noncontact lower limb injury in the 2020 regular season (AFL = 21, NRL = 51). The multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.85; P = 0.038) identified AFL players with larger QL CSA at increased risk of sustaining a noncontact lower limb injury during the regular season, but no relationship was found for LM CSA and noncontact lower limb injuries in the AFL (OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.36-2.78; P = 0.591) or NRL (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.29-1.33; P = 0.149).AFL players who sustained regular season noncontact lower limb injuries had larger QL CSA in preseason tests. No significant associations between either LM L5 CSA or LM L5 to QL ratio and regular season noncontact lower limb injuries were found."

The aim of this study was to compare the running asymmetry of healthy elite soccer players in training sessions at different times of the day. Methods: Sixteen healthy male elite soccer players were included in this study. Global Positioning System units (GPSports, SPI Pro, 5 Hz, GPSport, Canberra, Australia) were used to define training and running details. Fourteen (7 morning, 7 evening) training data were evaluated. Results: There was no statistical difference between morning and evening trainings in terms of training time, heart rate average and total running distance except for high speed running distance. Running asymmetry was 66% greater in evening training sessions than in morning training sessions (p=0.001; 4.13±1.92, 2.49±1.32 respectively). Running asymmetry did not show any significant correlation with training time, heart rate average, running distance, and high speed running distance (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Running asymmetry is higher in evening training sessions than in morning training sessions. Therefore, for athletes who are particularly at high risk of injury or who are in the process of a return to sports, and from whom high performance is not expected, morning trainings may be preferred instead of evening trainings. If training can not be performed in the morning, clinicians should follow the athletes instantly during evening training."

According to the literature, the deformity has been associated with acute medial collateral ligament tears, turf toe variant injuries, Lisfranc injury patterns, and first metatarsal fractures. There have been few documented cases of post-traumatic hallux valgus secondary to medial collateral ligament tears, and the treatment has been variable. Some authors have described direct end-to-end repair of the ligament to address the deformity, while others have described a modified McBride bunionectomy involving a Silver bunionectomy, lateral soft tissue release, and medial capsular and ligamentous repair. We propose a modified technique similar to the modified McBride bunionectomy, however, with the use of an all-suture anchor in the medial capsular and ligamentous repair. Our belief is that the all-suture anchor will allow for a stronger repair that will meet the physical demands of everyday ambulation and athletic participation. We used this technique in an individual who had evidence of a medial ligamentous complex injury of the hallux on MRI and failed conservative management. Postoperatively, the patient is immobilized until they can begin working on range of motion, strengthening, and finally to achieve return to full activity and sports."

Pearson's product-moment correlations were performed to determine the relationships between COD velocities, COD deficits, and the speed-power variables. Differences between players with higher and lower COD deficits were examined using magnitude-based inferences. Results showed that (1) greater sprint momentum was associated with higher COD deficits, particularly in drills with sharper angles and multiple directional changes (L-drill and pro-agility); (2) higher unilateral jump heights were associated with greater COD deficits in the pro-agility and L-drill but not in the CUT; (3) faster athletes were less efficient at changing direction and presented greater trunk and knee flexion angles during COD maneuvers, probably as a consequence of higher inertia."

Methods: Twelve college-level female handball athletes with no previous experience with resistance training performed five maximal isokinetic contractions of the knee extensors and knee flexors to determine isokinetic peak torque and hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios. Proprioception was determined by assessing passive position sense on an isokinetic dynamometer. Results: The athletes presented significantly greater (p < 0.01) knee extensors isometric peak torque for the jumping limb (144.9 ± 23.1) when compared to the non-jumping limb (132.9 ± 21.5). The Hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio was below 0.6 for both limbs, being significantly greater (p < 0.01) for the non-jumping limb (0.56 ± 0.08) when compared to the jumping limb (0.50 ± 0.08). Conclusion: Female handball athletes that do not engage in resistance training can experience functional bilateral asymmetries in the knee extensors and knee-joint instability, as assessed by the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio due to the asymmetric characteristics of handball. Regular strength training might correct such asymmetries and instabilities."

This makes it impossible for practising Sikhs to wear helmets and other protective headwear, mandatory in many countries and facilities for engagement in recreational pursuits (e.g., skiing) and on adventure outdoor recreation camps mandatorily run for school groups. The result is often social exclusion and ostracisation in the case of school children. Despite studies into the efficacy of protective helmets in some recreational outdoor activity settings, virtually nothing is known about the protective potential of turbans. This paper systematically reviews the extant literature on head injuries in several recreational outdoor activities and sports sectors (aerial, water, winter, wheeled and animal-based sports) and finds that the extant literature is of limited value when trying to understand the spatial distribution of trauma on the cranial surface. As the data do not permit to make inferences on the protective potential of turbans, future systematic, evidence-based epidemiological studies derived from hospital admissions and forensic examinations are required. Failure to do so perpetuates social exclusion and discrimination of religious grounds without an evidentiary basis for defensible public health measures."

Singing is a type of sportive activity and, like sports medicine, professional voice medicine is interested in the habilitation and rehabilitation of the vocal performer. The vocal needs of the professional vocal performer may not be similar to other professional or non-professional voice users. Like a professional athlete, a vocal performer’s ability to perform for many decades at a high level will be enhanced by basing artistic and lifestyle decisions on a scientifically sound foundation. Objective. The aim of this study is to present a multidimensional introduction to the methods of SVT, incorporating the principles of sport and exercise medicine, and physical therapy and rehabilitation. Reflection. Singing voice therapy needs to provide answers to “what”, “why”, “how”, and “when” questions. SVT must first correctly identify the problem, leading to the “how to do” solutions for a wide variety of cases, followed by a schedule of prescribed activities including answers to the “why” question (which exercise relates to which muscle). The periodization and motor learning principles provide a temporal answer to the “when” question when developing habilitation and/or rehabilitative protocols. Conclusion. Singing is not only an artistic expression but also a sportive performance. The clinical approach to the professional voice is a multidimensional and multi-layered team effort. All practices are structured by blending scientific and pedagogical knowledge."

Barriers to implementing such prevention programs have previously been identified such as lack of resources, logistic issues or motivation. The COVID-19 pandemic associated with restrictions on daily life dramatically impacted sports participation from training to competition. It is therefore reasonable to assume that such lockdown-like context has exacerbated the challenge to implement exercise-based injury prevention programs, potentially leading to a greater musculoskeletal injury risk. In this narrative review, recommendations are proposed for building an expertise- and evidence-based Standard Operating Procedure for injury prevention in lockdown-like contexts for high-level and professional athletes. The following recommendations can be provided: (1) assess the global and sport-specific risks in the light of the ongoing cause of isolation; (2) adapt remote training materials and programs; (3) ensure regular quality communication within the staff, between athletes and the staff as well as between athletes; (4) follow the athlete's mental well-being; and (5) plan for a safe return-to-sports as well as for an ongoing monitoring of the load-recovery balance. These key domains should further be addressed to comply with local policies, which are subject to change over time in each individual country. The use of these recommendations may improve the readiness of athletes, coaches, physicians and all sports stakeholders for future lockdown-like contexts."

The practice of exercise contributes by improving bone mineral density (BMD) and can prevent problems associated with low BMD. Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine BMD and measure bone turnover using blood markers in weightlifting athletes in response to exercise. Methods: The study included 16 athletes and 16 controls of both sexes in the range of 18 to 22 years old. BMD was determined at the femoral neck, hip, lumbar spine, and Total Mineral Density (TMD). The value of the total mineral density (TMDV) was obtained from the sum of the BMD of the evaluated regions. Bone formation and resorption in blood were evaluated by Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Acid Phosphatase (ACP), respectively. In addition, the concentration of urea and Creatine Kinase (CK) were determined. Results: The mean BMD of the lumbar spine and TMDV was of 1.2 g/cm 2 in female and male athletes. In young people who did not practice weightlifting, BMD in the lumbar spine (0.9 g/cm 2 in both groups) and TMDV (1.05 g/cm 2 in women and 1.11 g/cm 2 in men) were significantly lower ( p &lt;0.05). The activity in bone formation and CK in male athletes was twice as high compared to the other groups. The blood urea concentration in athletes (32.7- 38.0 mg/dL) was significantly higher ( p &lt;0.05) compared to the control groups (19.3-18.8 mg/dL). Conclusion: The practice of weightlifting benefits bone mass gain in the lumbar spine. These findings suggest that exercises in which high weight loads are supported promote bone turnover and mineralization to prevent bone weakening."

Knee-straining activities at work such as kneeling or squatting cause high biomechanical stresses on the knee joints that can lead to acute or chronic injuries. The objective of this systematic review is to update the evidence on the potential relationship between occupational risk factors and meniscal lesions. Methods We searched the Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases until August 2021 to identify epidemiological observational studies on the association between occupational risk factors and meniscal lesions. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Effect measures were extracted from individual studies and pooled with random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity analyses were conducted. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to assess the overall quality of evidence. Results The database search resulted in 11,006 references, and 46 additional studies were identified through hand search. Twenty-two studies (represented in 25 publications) met the predefined eligibility criteria and nine records were included in the meta-analysis. There was only one study with an overall low risk of bias. Significant associations between occupational risk factors and the development of meniscal lesions were found for kneeling (effect size (ES) 2.15, 95% CI 1.67–2.76), squatting (ES 2.01, 95% CI 1.34–3.03), climbing stairs (ES 2.28, 95% CI 1.58–3.30), lifting and carrying weights ≥ 10 kg (ES 1.63, 95% CI 1.35–1.96), lifting and carrying weights ≥ 25 kg (ES 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.24), playing football on a professional level (ES 5.22, 95% CI 3.24–8.41), working as a hard coal miner (ES 5.23, 95% CI 2.16–12.69) and floor layers (ES 1.99, 95% CI 1.43–2.78). The overall quality of evidence according GRADE was moderate to low. Conclusion We found consistent evidence of an increased risk of meniscal lesions by occupational knee-straining exposures. Our findings are important for the development of preventive strategies to reduce work-related knee disorders and work absence. Trial registration PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42020196279 )."

However, its effectiveness on sports performance remains poorly studied and its use is not widely practised among athletes, notably because of its accessibility and questionable effectiveness. The aim of this study is to show that this technology can be accessible, and that Alpha EEG-NFB is immediately effective. Fifteen professional soccer players took part in this study. Using a novel EEG headset that can be installed in less than one minute, and new processing software, the players performed two peripherical attentional tasks before and after, immediately and one month, a single Alpha EEG-NFB training session. The results showed a significant effect on both tasks immediately after EEG-NFB training, with a benefit of more than 30% and this performance continued after one month (20%). This study, the first to use this headset and software, shows that the improvement in sports performance can be related to cognitive performance, especially peripherical visual attentional functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the use of the EEG-NFB is accessible and effective for high-level athletes."

One such headband-mounted impact sensor is the SIM-G (Triax Technologies, Norwalk, CT, USA), which has been previously used to investigate the biomechanics of soccer heading by human subjects. Previous studies have evaluated the accuracy of the SIM-G for pure rotation and pendulum, impulse hammer and drop rig impacts. The current study used a soccer ball heading model to evaluate the accuracy of the SIM-G. A soccer ball was projected at the head of an anthropomorphic test device (ATD) representing a 10-year-old to replicate the heading maneuver at various impact sites, angles and speeds previously identified in youth soccer. Linear regression revealed that the SIM-G sensor overestimated the peak angular velocity and linear acceleration recorded by the ATD headform by approximately 44% and 105%, respectively. Tests in which the ball directly contacted the SIM-G sensor resulted in the largest peak linear accelerations. Glancing impacts were significantly associated with a decrease in percentage error of the SIM-G sensor peak angular velocity data relative to the ATD reference data. While it may not demonstrate accuracy in estimating the magnitudes of head impacts, the SIM-G remains a useful tool to provide estimates of head impact exposure for soccer players."

However, there is a lack of evidence on the efficacy of VR relaxation interventions to reduce anxiety in athletes and how that is portrayed in their movement patterns. The purpose of the current study was to examine how a VR relaxation intervention affected perceived anxiety levels and penalty kick performance of female soccer players. Thirteen female soccer players took five penalty kicks in baseline, stress-induced, and VR relaxation conditions. Perceived levels of anxiety, self-confidence, mental effort, heart rate (HR), accelerometry of the lumbar spine and thigh, and performance in each condition was obtained. Results indicated that the VR intervention significantly reduced cognitive anxiety and somatic anxiety from baseline (p = 0.002; p = 0.001) and stress (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Kendall's W = 0.72; 0.83). VR significantly increased self-confidence from baseline (p = 0.002) and stress (p = 0.001) with a large effect size (Kendall's W = 0.71). Additionally, all participants felt that VR helped them relax. Mental effort was significantly higher in the stress condition compared to that in baseline (p = 0.007) with moderate effect size (Kendall's W = 0.39). Peak acceleration and performance were not significantly influenced by stress or VR. This study serves as an initial step to evaluate VR relaxation interventions on performance in female soccer players."

https://openalex.org/W4200579079,Editorial,2021-12-13,2021,editorial,"That was the year that was! 2021 seemingly arrived just yesterday and now we are shortly to bid it farewell. I hailed its predecessor as heralding the hope for a new clarity of vision – the start of a new decade which promised much. However, I have become reminded that perfect 20/20 vision in the present may not necessarily lead to reliable predictions for the future. Further I have immediately been taken back to my undergraduate days and the unforgettable words of the great poet T. S Eliot in his poem Burnt Norton – the first of the four Quartets Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past. If all time is eternally present All time is unredeemable. What might have been is an abstraction Remaining a perpetual possibility Only in a world of speculation. What might have been and what has been Point to one end, which is always present They are words that seem to ring particularly true not only to anyone contemplating their remorselessly advancing years and reflecting on a career nearing completion, but they also seem particularly apposite for the experiences of the last two years. The pandemic started by destroying our expectations and predictions for what lay ahead. It ensured that our best laid plans for our immediate futures would remain unfulfilled and thus unredeemable. Subsequently during the year, we were left to speculate as to our future pathways - not only with regard to our professional activities, but also concerning our personal and family relationships – with a whole world of separation between ourselves and those of our kith and kin domiciled in distant lands. Though for some it may have been no more than a regional border! Such forced isolation caused many of us to think backwards as well, reflecting on our past trajectories and recalling both mistakes and successes alike. Yet for many it became a time to substitute the incessant demands of work and its associated travel and busy-ness with former and forgotten pleasures. Leisurely walks with friends and family, the rediscovering of rhythms and tempos unimpeded by the daily demands of our diaries and other extraneous demands on our time that had required us to respond immediately and forgo the immediate needs of the surroundings and people closest to us. Above all, with the future in limbo and the past re-emerging in our minds, it reinforced the realisation that the present is what we really have, and it contains what is most important. For a time, the incessant chatter and noise of the media retained our attention, just as it had dominated our attention at the end of 2019. Yet, somehow during the year, the hype and frenzied reporting seems to have diminished in impact. This was nowhere more evident than in the responses to COP26 – the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK. Items in the press came thick and fast leading up to the event: predictions of planetary doom; political conflicts were highlighted as world leaders met or didn’t meet on the conference stage; appearances by the celebrities of the world; demonstrations aplenty. All of this breathless activity faded imperceptibly out of our consciousness as the serious (but more boring?) negotiations between nations started to take place, with much of the brilliance of the limelight now exhausted. The anticlimactic conclusion was judged by Boris Johnson, the chair and among the most optimistic of politicians, as achieving a 6 out of 10. Several positive outcomes were identified such as: commitments to end deforestation; a global methane pledge; a socalled ‘Breakthrough Agenda’, which committed countries to work together to accelerate the clean energy transition. Yet predictably, this was labelled by the critics and activists as too little too late. Although there are many who would see climate crisis as the major crisis that faces us – there are many other current crises of even more pressing and immediate concern to very many of us. The most urgent of which, would depend upon your own circumstances and where you might find yourself in the world. Examples from recent media would include: the loss of previously taken for granted freedoms in Hong Kong; increased fears for personal safety and the prospect of hunger and poverty in Afghanistan; the loss of political freedoms and the prospects of war in Belarus and the Ukraine; the prospect of secession leading to renewed civil war in Serbia; another military coup in Sudan; civil unrest in Cuba, etc etc.. On a global scale the movement of people leaving failed states and war-torn areas looking for the chance to make a better future, has continued to increase on a scale that the world is quite unable to manage. Sadly, even in the countries that are eagerly sought as destinies, there seem to be endless stories of strife, anxiety and anger to be told. The Economist provides the example of France, the ninth largest economy in the world with the 20th largest population of 67+ million. This pillar of Europe is facing a presidential election. Far from rejoicing in its prosperity, stability and proud history – the mood is sombre. Tune in to any French prime time talk show this autumn, and discussion rages over the country’s wretched decline. France is losing its factories and jobs, squeezing incomes and small businesses, destroying its landscapes and language, neglecting its borders and squandering its global stature. Its people are fractious and divided, if not on the verge of a civil war, as a public letter from retired army officers suggested earlier this year. At the second presidential primary debate for the centre-right Republicans party, on November 14th, the five candidates competed with each other to chronicle French disaster. Listen to the hard right, and it is “the death of France as we know it”. The anxiety is widespread. In a recent poll 75% agreed that France is “in decline”. When asked to sum up their mood in another survey, the French favoured three words: uncertainty, worry and fatigue. So, we are entitled to ask, what is happening in the world as we contemplate the path out of Covid? Should we not be expecting some feeling of optimism and gratitude that modern medicine has provided a way forward out of the pandemic through vaccination and new medical treatments? We should be putting the trials and tribulations of the pandemic behind us, embracing the lessons we have learnt and anticipating the benefits of the reassessments and recalibrations we have undergone over the last two years. Yet instead, we seem to be facing re-entry into a world of strife and dissension. It is a view that that would seem to encourage retreat into the comfort of a limited and familiar space, rather than striking out confidently and optimistically. So, to return to Eliot – perhaps we need to be reminded that the present is all we have. We will only be able to experience our future when we arrive there. Therefore, the pathway we choose to it, should be as smooth, rich and rewarding as possible. It should not be characterised by hedonism but rather by enhancing rather than diminishing the future. Every moment spent devaluing either our future or our past, is a moment that further undermines our present. This last point is particularly true when we fail to see our present in the context of both our past and future. One of the major contributions to this current angst within our societies, appears to be the cultural wars being waged by the warriors of WOKE. Passing judgements on figures from a previous time, without a clear understanding of the context in which they operated makes absolutely no sense. It is akin to a capital punishment abolitionist vilifying the heroes of the French Revolution for allowing Madame Guillotine to be the agent of their retribution against the aristocracy. So, it is with defacing statues of those who lived and acted in far different times and were the product of the dominant values and beliefs of that time. It is indeed an act of vandalism. If we remove all evidence of the history to which such people belonged, how can we expect to learn from that time and ensure that the world does indeed move forward? Although we are talking about the context provided by time – this is equally true of all the contexts in which we currently find ourselves. It is impossible to understand human behaviour without knowing and understanding the context in which it occurs. This is a key principle of the science of human behaviour. Alas it is a principle that has been neglected in the sport sciences in recent years. Whereas research into the physiology, psychology and biomechanics of sport has flourished, too often it is reported in a way that fails to adequately take account of the context in which it occurs. It is why so many findings are ungeneralisable and remain in the laboratory rather than making the journey out onto the playing field of life. Understanding the history and the social context within which sport is practised is essential if scientists and professionals are going to be able to make comparisons between findings gained in different settings. Comparative studies in sport and physical education play an important role in enabling knowledge and understanding about these institutions to be widely shared. Our journal therefore has an important role to play in the development and sharing of knowledge and understanding between scientists and professionals in different settings. This is a role that has been filled by our journal over the last forty-three years. I am pleased to be able to report that the society (ISCPES), following a break of four years in activity, will be meeting again at the end of this year. The meeting which can be attended online will be hosted by Lakshmibai National College of Physical Education in India. Details are provided in this edition, and I commend this important meeting to you. That there is an interest and demand in comparative and international studies is clear from the number of submissions we have been receiving for our journal. The chance to meet with fellow researchers and colleagues in real time, if not actually face to face, is to be welcomed. It is my fervent hope that this will lead to continuing growth in interest in our multidiscipline and internationally focused field. I congratulate the organisers for their initiative. I would also like to pay tribute to former president Dr Walter Ho of the University of Macau, for his role in this as well as for his continuing support of our journal. So, I come to commend to you the contributions of this latest volume. They come from four different continents and as such provide a representative cross section of our readership. The topics about which they write give an example of the range of understanding and practices that can usefully be shared amongst us. In our first paper Croteau, Eduljee and Murphy report on the health, lifestyle behaviours and well-being of international Masters field hockey athletes. The Masters sport movement provides an important example of why sport represents a solid investment in assisting individuals to commit to health supporting physical activity across the lifespan. The study is particularly interesting, as it provides evidence of the broader sense of wellbeing to be gained by ongoing participation and also the fact that this benefit seems to apply even in the geographic and culturally different environments provided by life in Europe, North America and, Asia and the Pacific. Our second paper by Kubayi, Coopoo and Toriola addresses a familiar problem – the breakdown in communication between researchers and scientists in sport and the coaches who work with the athletes. The context for this study is provided by elite performance level sport in South Africa and the sports of soccer, athletics, hockey and netball. It is concluded that the sports scientists and academics need to be encouraged to make their work more available by presenting it more frequently face to face during coaching workshops, seminars, clinics and conferences. However, the caveat is that this needs to be done in a way that is understandable, applicable and relevant to helping the coach make effective decisions and solve problems in a way that benefits the athletes as the end product. A team of medical and pedagogical scientists from Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia provide the Asian input to this volume. They raise a concern over the issue of safety and risk in physical education and how well specialists in the subject are prepared in the area of sport injury management. Hidayat, Sakti, Putro, Triannga, Farkhan, Rahayu and Magetsari collaborated in a survey of 191 physical education teachers. They concluded that there was a need for better and more sustained teacher education on this important topic. PE teacher training should not only upgrade teachers’ knowledge but also increase their self-perceptions of competence. PE teachers should be provided with enhanced training on sports injuries and Basic Life Support (BLS) skills, in order to improve the safety and maximize the benefits of PE classes. It is a finding that could usefully be compared with current practices in other countries and settings, given the common focus in the PE lesson on children performing challenging tasks in widely varying contexts. Our final paper by Rojo, Ribeiro and Starepravo takes a very much broader perspective. Sport migration is a relatively new, specialised but expanding field in sports studies. This paper is however significant not for what it can tell us about current knowledge in sport migration, but rather in what it tells us about the way knowledge is gathered and disseminated in a specialist area such as this. Building on the ideas of Bourdieu, they demonstrate how the field of knowledge is shaped by the key actors in the process and how these key actors serve to gather and use their academic capital in that process. As such fields of knowledge can become artificially constricted in both the spaces and cultures in which they develop. The authors highlight a very real problem in the generation and transmission of academic knowledge, and it is one that International Sports Studies is well positioned to address. In conclusion, may I encourage you in sharing with these papers to actively engage in reflecting on the importance of the varying contexts these authors bring and how sensitivity to this can enlarge and deepen our own practices and understanding.

Methods 67 male players were divided by chronological age into the under-17 (U17: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), under-20 (U20: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 22), and above-20-year (PRO: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) groups. They performed countermovement (CMJ) and squat (SJ) jumps. Also, maximal isometric contractions during knee flexion and extension for right (R-TOR) and left limb (L-TOR) torque were assessed. Hamstrings-quadriceps (H:Q) and CMJ:SJ ratios were determined. Results Compared with U17 and U20, PRO showed higher CMJ (Δ = 20% and 14%; both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) and SJ (Δ = 19% and 13%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02, respectively), and higher absolute R-TOR and L-TOR during knee extension (Δ = 40% and 58%; both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01). PRO exhibited higher absolute L-TOR and R-TOR during knee flexion than U17 (Δ = 22% and 26%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01, respectively). Between-group differences were not detected in normalized torque, except for knee extension R-TOR (PRO &gt; U17; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Greater differences for quadriceps absolute torque (effect size: 1.37–1.46) were observed in the hamstrings (effect size: 0.30–0.92) between PRO and U17. No differences were found for any H:Q torque ratio, but moderate effect sizes (0.71–0.75) were verified between PRO and the other groups. No differences were found for CMJ:SJ ratio. Conclusions PRO players are more powerful than U17 and U20. Differences in strength level between PRO and U17/U20 are muscle-dependent. The larger strength development of quadriceps over hamstrings can result in lower isometric H:Q torque ratio for PRO."

https://openalex.org/W4200140262,The Problematic Experience of Players' Mutations Between Clubs: Discovering the Social Adaptability Skills Required,2021-12-09,2021,article,"Objective: During their career, most players working in professional team sports move from club to club. These transitions are not always completely successful and could highly impact the route of the players' development. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the psychological processes involved when players encounter problems in adapting from one club to another. Thus, it was the aim of this study to identify the most difficult aspects of these transitions, as experienced by team sports players and the psychological skills that contribute to successful outcomes. Design and Method: The present study included twenty professional basketball players (aged between 20 and 36 years old; Mean = 26.05, SD = 4.12), who had played under different coaches (coach range 4-15; Mean = 8.65, SD = 2.92), and also played for different clubs (range 3-10; Mean = 5.35, SD = 2.08). They took part in retrospective interviews regarding their embedded experiences during club to club transitions. A situated E-approach was used to identify their problematic experiences, the adaptability skills and how they are applied during club mutations. Results and Conclusions: The identification of problematic experiences revealed seven components in relation to coaching (e.g., obeying orders, reduced play time), three components with teammates (e.g., respect), two components with the club (e.g., lack of support), and three components with family/friends (e.g., geographical constraints). Additionally, results indicated that the adaptability skills used during mutation are related to three groups namely mental skills, learning methods, and interpersonal skills. The results provide coaches, players, sports psychologists, and national sport organizations a set of issues for understanding the challenges players encounter when they move from one club to another."

https://openalex.org/W4200497972,Fiber orientation downsampling compromises the computation of white matter tract-related deformation,2021-12-09,2021,preprint,"Abstract Incorporating neuroimaging-revealed structural details into finite element (FE) head models opens vast new opportunities to better understand brain injury mechanisms. Recently, growing efforts have been made to integrate fiber orientation from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) into FE models to predict white matter (WM) tract-related deformation that is biomechanically characterized by tract-related strains. Commonly used approaches often downsample the spatially enriched fiber orientation to match the FE resolution with one orientation per element (i.e., element-wise orientation implementation). However, the validity of such downsampling operation and corresponding influences on the computed tract-related strains remain elusive. To address this, the current study proposed a new approach to integrate voxel-wise fiber orientation from one DTI atlas (isotropic resolution of 1 mm 3 ) into FE models by embedding orientations from multiple voxels within one element (i.e., voxel-wise orientation implementation). By setting the responses revealed by the newly proposed voxel-wise orientation implementation as the reference, we evaluated the reliability of two previous downsampling approaches by examining the downsampled fiber orientation and the computationally predicted tract-related strains secondary to one concussive impact. Two FE models with varying element sizes (i.e., 6.37 ± 1.60 mm and 1.28 ± 0.55 mm, respectively) were incorporated. The results showed that, for the model with a large voxel-mesh resolution mismatch, the downsampled element-wise fiber orientation, with respect to its voxel-wise counterpart, exhibited an absolute deviation over 30° across the WM/gray matter interface and the pons regions. Accordingly, this orientation deviation compromised the computation of tract-related strains with normalized root-mean-square errors up to 30% and underestimated the peak tract-related strains up to 10%. For the other FE model with finer meshes, the downsampling-induced effects were lower, both on the fiber orientation and tract-related strains. Taken together, the voxel-wise orientation implementation is recommended in future studies as it leverages the DTI-delineated fiber orientation to a larger extent than the element-wise orientation implementation. Thus, this study yields novel insights on integrating neuroimaging-revealed fiber orientation into FE models and may better inform the computation of WM tract-related deformation, which are crucial for advancing the etiological understanding and computational predictability of brain injury.

The role of AI in improving decision-making and forecasting in sports, amongst many other advantages, is rapidly expanding and gaining more attention in both the academic sector and the industry. Nonetheless, for many sports audiences, professionals and policy makers, who are not particularly au courant or experts in AI, the connexion between artificial intelligence and sports remains fuzzy. Likewise, for many, the motivations for adopting a machine learning (ML) paradigm in sports analytics are still either faint or unclear. In this perspective paper, we present a high-level, non-technical, overview of the machine learning paradigm that motivates its potential for enhancing sports (performance and business) analytics. We provide a summary of some relevant research literature on the areas in which artificial intelligence and machine learning have been applied to the sports industry and in sport research.

The second goal was to analyse how the dorsal and lumbar curves behave in the three phases of the rowing gesture, and to determine which phases can be detrimental to the correct development of the spine during growth. We analysed the spine curvatures in the sagittal plane of 29 females and 82 males, which were measured with an inclinometer in standing, slump sitting, maximal trunk flexion and during rowing performance. The average value of thoracic kyphosis in the rowers was 30° (mean, 30 + 8.27°). Thoracic hyperkyphosis was found in only two rowers (1.8%). Lumbar lordosis was within normal range in 84.1% of the males (mean, 27 + 9.57°) and 75.9% of female rowers (mean, 33°). Functional thoracic hyperkyphosis was observed in 57.4% of the males and 17.1% of the females. Functional lumbar hyperkyphosis was observed in 28 of the 69 males (40.5%) and five of 22 females (17.2%). Rowing seems to provide adequate spine alignment in the sagittal plane on standing. The integrated spinal assessment of the sagittal morphotype showed that half or our rowers presented with functional thoracic hyperkyphosis, and 43.2% presented with functional lumbar hyperkyphosis. Spine behaviour during the rowing technique shows that the thoracic kyphosis (98.2%) and lumbar spine (91%) perform within normative ranges and could explain the adequate positioning of the spine in the sagittal plane on standing. Years of rowing training tend to reduce thoracic kyphosis in males."

The review evaluates and synthesises models and proposes recommended avenues for future research. The two major models of the Input-Mediator-Output-Input (IMOI) framework and the Big Five dimensions of teamwork were reviewed and both will need significant development for application to future teams comprising non-human agents. Research suggests that a multi-method approach is appropriate for team measurements, such as the integration of methods from self-report, observer ratings, event-based measurement and automated recordings. Simulations are recommended as the most effective team-based training interventions. The impact of new technology and autonomous agents is discussed with respect to the changing nature of teamwork. In particular, whether existing teamwork models and measures are suitable to support the design, operation and evaluation of human-nonhuman teams of the future. Practitioner summary: This review recommends a multi-method approach to the measurement and evaluation of teamwork. Team models will need to be adapted to describe interaction with non-human agents, which is what the future is most likely to hold. The most effective team training interventions use simulation-based approaches."

Mechanical demands (landing height) in landing tasks may affect the biomechanical differences between individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI). However, energy dissipation strategies during landing from various heights in individuals with CAI are unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of landing height on lower extremity biomechanics between individuals with and without CAI. Eleven participants in each of the CAI and Control group performed a single-leg landing from three heights (30, 40, and 50 cm). We calculated the contribution of each joint to total energy dissipation at 50-ms intervals during 0-200 ms post-initial contact (IC). Peak joint angles and moments and joint stiffnesses were calculated during 0-200 ms post-IC. Two-way mixed analysis of variance revealed significant group-by-height interactions for hip energy dissipation at 101-150 ms post-IC and peak ankle plantarflexion and hip extension moment. These significant interactions suggested that the effects of landing height on the ankle and hip joints differ between individuals with and without CAI. The effect of mechanical demands on altered landing biomechanics among CAI populations should be considered in biomechanical studies and clinical practice."

This study clarified hip joint mobility and dynamic balance ability in soccer players with functional ankle instability. This case–control study included 17 male college soccer players. All participants were assessed using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and were divided into chronic ankle instability (CAI) and non-CAI groups for each of their dominant and nondominant legs. Bilateral passive hip range of motion (ROM) was assessed and the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) was measured for each leg. In the dominant leg, the reach in the posterolateral direction in the CAI group was significantly less than that in the non-CAI group. Hip internal rotation angles in the dominant leg in the CAI group were greater than those in the non-CAI group; however, no significant correlations with the three directions of mSEBT were observed. In the nondominant leg, mSEBT and hip ROMs did not show any significant differences between groups. The dominant leg in soccer players with CAI had poor dynamic balance ability while reaching posterolaterally. However, acquiring hip flexibility may not be necessary to improve the dynamic balance ability. These findings may help develop future research."

The available evidence suggests that ACL reconstruction diminishes somatosensory feedback and proprioceptive functioning, which are vital for adequate joint positioning and movement control. Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of an ACL rupture on knee proprioception after arthroscopic ACL repair surgery or conservative treatment. Methods A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Guidelines for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature search was performed in the following databases from inception to 10th October 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library and Scopus. Randomized and non-randomized studies that evaluated proprioception using the joint position sense (JPS) and threshold to detection of passive motion (TTDPM) techniques at 15°–30° knee flexion with an external healthy control group in a time period between 6 and 24 months post injury or operation were included in the analysis. Results In total, 4857 studies were identified, from which 11 were included in the final quantitative analysis. The results demonstrated that proprioception after arthroscopic ACL repair surgery was significantly lower than in the healthy control group (JPS: standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.87, p &lt; 0.01, n = 6 studies; TTDPM: SMD 0.77, 95% CI 0.20–1.34, p &lt; 0.01, n = 4 studies). There were no significant differences in proprioception between the conservative treatment group and the healthy control group (JPS: SMD 0.57, 95% CI − 0.69 to 1.84, p = 0.37, n = 4 studies; TTDPM: SMD 0.82, 95% CI − 0.02 to 1.65, p = 0.05, n = 2 studies), although measures for TTDPM were close to statistical significance. Conclusion The findings of the present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that knee proprioception is persistently compromised 6–24 months following surgical treatment of ACL tears compared with healthy controls. The reduced kinesthetic awareness after ACL surgery is of high relevance for optimizing individual treatment plans in these patients. As the current literature is still scarce about the exact underlying mechanisms, further research is needed. Trial Registration The present systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021198617)."

Review article,2021-12-02,2021,review,"Purpose: to determine the existence of a relationship between the development of muscles responsible for postural balance in a person and running efficiency.Research methods. A literature search was carried out using data from Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection and Pub Med. 40 sources were selected for analysis. Preference was given to works published in publications with a Q1 - Q2 rating.Results. Different sports have different requirements for a person's postural stability. The postural balance is of the greatest importance for the representatives of football, hockey, basketball. Running is the basis of many sports. Therefore, the study of postural balance during running loads is the basis for understanding the mechanisms of maintaining dynamic balance. There is currently research showing that jogging alone improves postural balance. It has also been shown that strengthening the muscles responsible for the postural balance of a person increases the stability of walking and running. The dynamic and static postural balance is influenced by aerobic fatigue, as well as accumulated fatigue in the annual training cycle of athletes. Deterioration of the work of the muscles responsible for the postural balance of a person can lead to injuries, diseases, and also limit the achievement of high sports results in running.Conclusions. This is one of the first studies of postural balance in running. In the work, data will be obtained on the positive influence of the development of postural balance (with the use of exercises for strengthening muscles - local stabilizers, balance exercises) on the running technique and the functional state of runners."

Cam morphology (present in almost two of every three football players) may explain this heightened risk, but there is limited research on its role in hip OA development in younger athletes. Knowledge of this relationship will advance our understanding of the aetiology of hip OA in football players. We aimed to study the relationship between cam morphology size and MRI-defined cartilage defects and labral tears, and if this relationship differs by symptomatic state in young adult football players.For this case-control study, 182 (288 hips) symptomatic (hip and/or groin pain >6 months and positive flexion-adduction-internal-rotation (FADIR) test) and 55 (110 hips) pain-free football players (soccer or Australian football) underwent anteroposterior and Dunn 45° radiographs, and 3-Tesla MRI. Cam morphology size was defined using alpha angle, and cartilage defects and labral tears were scored semiquantitatively. Presence, location and score (severity) of cartilage defects and labral tears were determined. Each participant completed the International Hip Outcome Tool 33 and Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score.Greater alpha angle was associated with cartilage defects (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04) and labral tears (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04). Greater alpha angle was associated with superolateral cartilage defects (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05) and superior labral tears (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05). The association of alpha angle with MRI-defined cartilage defects and labral tears was no greater in football players with symptoms than in those without (p=0.189-0.937).Cam morphology size was associated with cartilage defects and labral tears in young adult football players with and without pain. This study provides evidence that cam morphology may contribute to the high prevalence of hip OA in football players. Prospective studies of football players are now needed to establish if cam morphology causes progression of cartilage defects and labral tears and development of hip OA."
https://openalex.org/W4206827639,A Multi-Systems Approach to Human Movement after ACL Reconstruction: The Musculoskeletal System,2021-12-01,2021,article,"Several negative adaptations to the musculoskeletal system occur following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and ACL reconstruction (ACLR) such as arthrogenic muscle inhibition, decreased lower extremity muscle size, strength, power, as well as alterations to bone and cartilage. These changes have been associated with worse functional outcomes, altered biomechanics, and increased risk for re-injury and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. After ACL injury and subsequent ACLR, examination and evaluation of the musculoskeletal system is paramount to guiding clinical decision making during the rehabilitation and the return to sport process. The lack of access many clinicians have to devices necessary for gold standard assessment of muscle capacities and force profiles is often perceived as a significant barrier to best practices. Fortunately, testing for deficits can be accomplished with methods available to the clinician without access to costly equipment or time-intensive procedures. Interventions to address musculoskeletal system deficits can be implemented with a periodized program. This allows for restoration of physical capacities by adequately developing and emphasizing physical qualities beginning with mobility and movement, and progressing to work capacity and neuromuscular re-education, strength, explosive strength, and elastic or reactive strength. Additional considerations to aid in addressing strength deficits will be discussed such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, volume and intensity, eccentric training, training to failure, cross-education, and biomechanical considerations. The American Physical Therapy Association adopted a new vision statement in 2013 which supported further development of the profession's identity by promoting the movement system, yet validation of the movement system has remained a challenge. Application of a multi-physiologic systems approach may offer a unique understanding of the musculoskeletal system and its integration with other body systems after ACLR. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to highlight important musculoskeletal system considerations within a multi-physiologic system approach to human movement following ACLR."

However, it is unknown whether female recreational athletes are susceptible to fatigue or not, compared to female collegiate athletes with greater physical activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine and clarify the effects of fatigue and recovery on knee biomechanics of the drop vertical jump (DVJ) in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes. Methods Fifteen female collegiate athletes and ten female recreational athletes were enrolled in the current study. All subjects were basketball players and Tegner activity scales were level 9 and 7, respectively. They performed DVJ before and after the fatigue protocol. Three-dimensional knee kinematics and kinetics were collected during landing phase of DVJ. The data after the fatigue protocol (first, second, and third DVJs) were compared with those before the protocol using one-way repeated measures of analysis of variance in each group. Results Fatigue caused significant increase of knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC) and peak abduction moments within 40 ms from IC in female recreational athletes, whereas no increases of these parameters were observed in female collegiate athletes. Moreover, recovery from fatigue seemed to be more slowly in female recreational athletes than in female collegiate athletes as smaller knee flexion moment was observed even in post-fatigue third DVJ only for female recreational athletes. Conclusions Effects of fatigue on DVJ were significantly greater and continued for a longer duration in female recreational athletes compared to female collegiate athletes."

A recent study in New Zealand found that a history of rugby participation or concussions were associated with neurocognitive deficits, as measured by CNS Vital Signs (CNSVS) test battery. Although it is a vastly different context, rugby is just as popular in South Africa as in New Zealand. Despite this, no study to date has quantified the effects of rugby exposure and concussion history as measured by CNSVS. Aim The aim of the study was to determine the association between cognitive function and rugby exposure and/or concussion history among adult first division rugby players in South Africa. Research methodology The research conducted was a cross-sectional survey which targeted first division rugby players in KwaZulu-Natal. The research tools used were the CNSVS test battery and the General Health Rugby (GHR) questionnaire which were used in a similar study in New Zealand. Results and discussion This study revealed a weak Pearson coefficient -0.24 (p = 0.05) between the number of years of rugby playing experience and neurocognitive index (NCI) score, which indicated that every additional year of rugby played resulted in a minor decrease in the NCI score of the respondents. However, multiple regression analyses revealed that the association between rugby playing experience and NCI score was attenuated (p = 0.41). Despite the multiple regression association not being significant (p = 0.53), this study reported medium to large effect size inverse associations between the number of concussions sustained by the players and their NCI domain scores. Conclusion and recommendations Rugby is a physically demanding team sport played in South Africa as well as across the globe, therefore the need for research pertaining to neurological health in rugby is necessary. This study indicated a weak negative association between the number of years of rugby playing experience and the respondents’ NCI scores. Furthermore, this study reported a medium to large effect size inverse association between the number of concussions sustained by the players and their NCI domain scores, and as such warrants further exploration in more prospective studies. There is a need for additional research with regards to neurological health in rugby players, taking into account concussive and sub-concussive exposure."

On the other hand, sport type and its specific nature and demands, may also be connected with the level of state and trait anxiety. This study aimed to investigate potential differences in the competitive trait anxiety level and general self-esteem according to gender in sports of different contact level. The sample consisted of 1024 (590 males and 434 females) young athletes. Independent variables were sport contact level (non-contact, contact and collision sports) and gender. Dependent variables were measured by the adjusted versions of Sport Competition Anxiety Test and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Basic descriptive statistics was calculated for all the groups, and the differences between them were established using χ² test and MANOVA. The results suggest significant differences in trait competitive anxiety per sport type, gender and their interaction, and no differences in the general self-esteem level. The current study reveals that not only the intensity but also the intergroup relationship of a sport contact level (non-contact, contact and collision sports) is gender determined. These findings are important in psycho-diagnostic procedure and choosing appropriate coping strategies for athletes."

Core stability is crucial to prevent SSS. The study investigated the effect of isokinetic core strength of trunk flexors and extensors and core endurance on shoulder stability in adolescent swimmers with SSS. Methods The study involved 30 swimmers, assigned to 2 equal groups. The experimental group (A) suffered from SSS; the control group (B) included healthy swimmers with no history of shoulder pain or instability. The mean values of age, body mass, and height were 12.86 ± 1.59 years, 41.73 ± 3.99 kg, and 142.0 ± 3.96 cm, respectively, in group A and 13.2 ± 1.56 years, 42.66 ± 3.9 kg, and 142.26 ± 4.39 cm, respectively, in group B. Isokinetic peak torque (PT) for trunk flexors and extensors was measured with a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Four functional tests assessed core endurance: side bridge endurance test, static back endurance test, ball bridge test, and unilateral bridge test. Results There was a statistically significant between-group difference in mean PT of trunk extension at both angular velocities: 60°/s, 180°/s. No significant differences were detected in mean PT of trunk flexion. All functional core stability tests revealed a greater endurance time in group B. Conclusions Weak core inhibits shoulder muscles, which is a major risk factor for shoulder instability and SSS. It is crucial to incorporate core stability training into the rehabilitation plan to provide proximal stability for obtaining safe and proper distal mobility across the shoulder joint."

Bio-banding reduced the within-bio-banded group variance for anthropometric values, when compared to an aggregated chronological banded group (chronological: 5.1–16.7%CV; bio-banded: 3.0–17.3%CV). Differences between these bio-banded groups ranged from moderate to very large (ES = 0.97 to 2.88). Physical performance variance (chronological: 4.8–24.9%CV; bio-banded: 3.8–26.5%CV) was also reduced with bio-banding compared to chronological aged grouping. However, not to the same extent as anthropometric values with only 68.3% of values reduced across banding methods compared to 92.6% for anthropometric data. Differences between the bio-banded groups physical qualities ranged from trivial to very large (ES = 0.00 to 3.00). The number of functional movement metrics and %CV reduced by bio-banding was lowest within the ‘circa-PHV’ groups (11.1–44.4%). The proportion of players achieving the threshold value score of ≥ 14 for the FMS™ was highest within the ‘post-PHV’ group (50.0–53.7%). The use of maturity status bio-banding can create more homogenous groups which may encourage greater competitive equity. However, findings here support a bio-banding maturity effect hypothesis, whereby maturity status bio-banding has a heightened effect on controlling for characteristics which have a stronger association to biological growth."

https://openalex.org/W4321269145,Varus knee deformity in adolescent soccer players,2021-11-29,2021,article,"The lower limb axis develops dynamically throughout the first and second decades of life. In recent years, with respect to youth athletes, we have been facing a progressive increase in the intensity of exercise during training and competition (involving increased time, frequency, and power), and, as a result, there hasbeen an increase in the number of acute and chronic overuse injuries. There are some sports with a higher incidence of injuries, one of which is soccer. A review of literature for the past 15 years with a focus on varus knee deformities in adolescent soccer players showed that varus axial deformities of the lower limbsoccur more frequently in soccer players than in the general population and in athletes from other sport, probably due to the specific loading pattern in soccer training. Varus deformities alter knee biomechanics, which results in medial joint space overloading, and consequently an early onset of degenerative joint disease. In addition, bowlegs predisposes athletes to patellofemoral pain syndrome and meniscal lesions. The etiology of genu varum in soccer is thought to be multifactorial, ranging from the natural selection of players to mechanical overload of the proximal medial tibial growth plate. A growing number of clinical reports and animal studies have indicated that intensive sport training may precipitate pathologic changes of the knee joint growth plate, and even produce a growth disturbance."

Performance analysis provides an important means of classifying and quantifying athletic prowess in terms of the significant performance aspects of the sport to provide objective feedback. This study aimed to analyze technical execution in terms of punch trajectory, force, velocity and time, considering the expert-novice paradigm by investigating the technical execution of 31 experienced and non-experienced athletes for the four main punching techniques of the cross, jab, uppercut and hook strike. The kinetic and kinematic data were collected by means of a boxing monitoring system developed and validated for in-field use. The research revealed significant correlation for executed punching trajectory and punch force in intragroup comparison and significant differences in intergroup comparison. No significant differences were detected for punch velocity in either inter- or intra-group paradigms. This study, through use of the sensor system, aligns with the results of existing publications conducted in laboratory conditions, in the assessment of punch force, punch speed and punch time and thus extends the state of research by use of a smart wearable in field method."

Twenty-three male professional football players (age 24 ± 4.5 years, range 18-34 years; body mass 80.21 ± 8.4 kg; height 178.26 ± 7.62 cm) took part in a randomised, cross-over design to test the potentiating responses of two AEL conditions (AEL20 and AEL40) versus a body weight control group (CON). Mean loads for the two conditions were 15.84 ± 1.70 kg (AEL20) and 31.67 ± 3.40 kg (AEL40). There was no significant difference between the three conditions for jump height (p = 0.507, η2G = 0.022). There were significant differences in peak power between the groups (p = 0.001, η2G = 0.154). Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment showed significantly higher peak power for both AEL conditions compared to the control group, but no significant differences between AEL conditions (CON vs. AEL20, p = 0.029, 95% CI -1016.735, -41.815, Cohen's d = -0.56; CON vs. AEL40, p = 0.001, 95% CI -1244.995, -270.075, Cohen's d = -0.81; AEL20 vs. AEL40, p = 0.75, 95% CI -715.720, 259.201, Cohen's d = -0.24). There was no significant difference between the three conditions for peak velocity (p = 0.269, η2G = 0.046). AEL using either 20% or 40% of body mass may be used to increase peak power in the countermovement jump in well-trained professional football players."

Considering particularly learner perceptions in the learning environment design is known to improve both their learning and wellbeing. There are no, however, shared theoretical frameworks guiding the learning environment co-design from the learner perspective. As a response to this challenge, a learning environment design (LED) framework was developed based on the literature and co-design involving learners aged 7 to 19 (n = 342) in Finland (n = 266) and Spain (n = 76). The LED framework entails 53 characteristics grouped under seven constructs. It draws attention to the importance of balancing communality with individuality, comfort with health, and novelty with conventionality. Flexibility and functionality are recognised as central enablers for a quality learning environment. The study suggests a design framework and principles for learning environment co-design. They can serve as a research-based introduction to the topic after which priorities can be defined based on the concrete design target and goals, and concrete design solutions can be created in the participatory design involving learners and other key stakeholders."

We determined the effects of CAF-CHO mouth-rinsing on kinetics, kinematics, and perceptual measures during a sprint-endurance performance commonly performed by track and field athletes in Muslim athletes fasting during Ramadan. In a randomised and counterbalanced single-blind study, ten national-level male sprinters and sprint/middle-distance runners (21.0 ± 2.0 y) participated in this study. They performed three sprint-endurance sessions on a non-motorised treadmill within the second and third weeks of Ramadan. Each session consisted of 3x15-s all-out sprints, with 2-min active recovery between each sprint. In each session, athletes either did not mouth rinse (NMR), or rinsed with 25 mL of CAF-CHO (4 g carbohydrate, 5 mg caffeine), or a placebo solution (PLA) prior to warm-up (30-min pre-trial), 1-min pre-trial, and mid-way through every recovery period. CAF-CHO maximised total sprint distance relative to NMR (210.3 ± 7.8 vs. 208.7 ± 9.1 m, d = 0.20), whilst counteracted the attenuation following PLA (204.6 ± 8.7 m; d = 0.66). Relative to NMR, CAF-CHO increased perceived activation prior to each sprint (p < 0.05, d = 1.23-2.05). Post-trial perceived exertion was lower for CAF-CHO (d = 0.12) and PLA (d = 0.58) compared to NMR (p > 0.05). Athletes indicated 'no' (50%) or 'unsure' (50%) whether mouth-rinsing would improve performance. The results suggest that CAF-CHO has a potential to optimise, and counter-act the negative effect of mouth-rinsing in Ramadan-fasted Muslims having a negative attitude towards this procedure."

Twenty male competitive outfield soccer players (age 19.6±1.3y, body mass 73.6±8.2kg) were split into experimental (n=10) and control groups. In the experimental group, 20m linear sprint time was measured immediately before and 5, 6 and 7minutes after the sled push with either 50 or 100% body mass. The control group performed the 20m sprints only. A repeated measures ANOVA comparing control and experimental groups revealed no effects of time, group or time by group interaction for either experimental condition (all P&gt;0.05). The repeated measures ANOVA compared the experimental conditions revealed effects of time (P=0.034) and group (P=0.002), but not time by group (P&gt;0.05). The effects sizes demonstrated within group effects on sprint time that were small to moderate (-0.26 to 0.71) and trivial to small (-0.31 to 0.09) for the 50% and 100% body mass condition, respectively. These findings demonstrate that a sled push has no significant effect on 20 m sprint time in competitive footballers. If coaches continue to prescribed a sled push before sprinting, a single 15 m push with 50% body mass could have positive benefits."

Numerous professionals have been drawn to this subject, and many viable prediction systems have been developed. Prediction of potential knee joint injury is critical to effectively avoid knee joint injury during exercise. The current prediction algorithms are mainly implemented through expert interviews, medical reports, and historical documents. The algorithms have problems with low prediction accuracy or precision values. There is a need to understand more knee injury factors and improve the prediction accuracy; hence, the intelligent prediction algorithm for potential injury of knee joints of football players is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the characteristics of the knee joint injury and the injury factors of the football players are gathered and analyzed. Then, the damage is predicted by the similarity measurement. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher prediction accuracy and shorter time. According to the findings of a survey that collected healthcare data, several key factors contribute to football knee injuries. To a degree, this algorithm can predict the likelihood of a football player's knee injury."

In some cases, musculoskeletal system functional disorders occur during long-term training in certain sports, when training are held without taking into account the anatomical and biomechanical pecularities of the growing young athlete body using a large number of monotonous physical activities. The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in young athletes engaged in various sports is growing steadily. Our research has expanded the understanding of musculoskeletal system functional state of young football players. It was found that normal posture is characteristic of 50% of players aged 11-12 years, and 42, 85% of players aged 12-13 years. In young athletes, the most common musculoskeletal system functional disorder is scoliotic posture, which is found in 26.66% of players aged 11-12 years and 28.57% of players aged 12-13 years. The second detected musculoskeletal system functional disorder in young football players is a round back detected in 16.67% of 11-12 year olds and 17.14% in 12-13 year old athletes. The data obtained indicate the fact that the problem of musculoskeletal system functional disorders in young athletes is more acute than ever. The results obtained supplemented the information base on somatometric indicators of football players aged 11-13."
https://openalex.org/W3216693526,Evaluation of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) in Identifying Active Females Who are Prone to Injury. A Systematic Review,2021-11-22,2021,review,"Abstract Background The validity of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) in identifying active females who are predisposed to injury has not been specifically reviewed. This study aims to synthesize the literature on the ability of the FMS to identify at-risk active females. Methods Six online databases, including PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct, SPORTDiscus and Google Scholar, were searched for the period of April 2006 to September 2021. Out of the 61 potential references, 17 were reviewed in detail with respect to the inclusion criteria; ten were ultimately included. The risk of bias, applicability and level of the studies were then identified using the QUADAS-2 and a checklist for assessing methodological quality. The following data were obtained from the included studies: year of publication, title, study type, participants’ demographic, sample size, FMS cutoff point, injury definition, statistical analyses used, FMS results and study level. Results Generally, the quality of eight studies was poor to moderate due to both small sample sizes and short follow-up periods. Except for a study on military members, all studies were carried out on team sports players. The overall bias of the studies was low, but there was an unclear amount of bias for participant selection. Two studies reported no predictive validity for the FMS, while three defended its predictive validity; the rest partially supported the FMS as a valid diagnostic tool. The reliability of the recommended cutoff point was confirmed, though cutoffs higher than 14 were significantly associated with the predictive ability of the FMS. Conclusion Although the FMS is reliable for clinical practice, and the current literature shows promise regarding the predictive ability of the FMS among active females, concerns remain regarding its validity in identifying at-risk females. Given the lack of clarity in the literature on the use of the FMS in females, further well-organized studies with larger sample sizes and longer monitoring periods are highly recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of the recommended cutoff of ≤ 14 has considerably decreased , and higher cutoff values should be applied to increase the FMS predictive ability. Level of evidence The level of evidence was determined to be 2b."

We endeavoured to assess the current approaches to managing syndesmotic injuries through a Research Electronic Data Capture survey.The survey consisted of 27 questions, including respondent demographics, indications for treatment of syndesmotic injuries, preferred treatment and technique, and postoperative management. Responses were generated through six different athlete scenarios: moderate impact, high impact, and very high impact athletes with/without complete deltoid injury. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all categorical responses.A total of 742 providers responded to the survey, including 457 American surgeons and 285 members of various international societies. Flexible devices were the preferred fixation construct (47.1%), followed by screws (29.6%), hybrid fixation (e.g. combination of flexible device and screw, 18%), and other (5.3%). Sixty-four percent of respondents noted that their rehabilitation protocols would not change for each athlete scenario. Considerable variability was present in anticipated return to full participation, largely dependent on the presence or absence of a deltoid ligament injury.The most common elements used as surgical indications were syndesmosis widening > 2 mm on x-ray, an anterior inferior talofibular ligament injury in combination with a posterior inferior talofinular ligament or deltoid ligament involvement on magnetic resonance imaging, and widening of the distal tibiofibular joint during arthroscopic evaluation. Overall, flexible fixation (e.g. suture button) was the preferred device choice for the repair of an injured syndesmosis. Most respondents did not alter their rehab protocol or anticipated return to play timeline based on the injury severity. However, there was considerable variability between respondents on the time to weight-bearing, running, and full participation. Further pragmatic outcomes data are necessary to guide safe return to play protocols for syndesmotic injuries.Level IV."

How are these representations structured and which knowledge is shared among experts in the same discipline? To address these questions, the event segmentation task was used. Experts in Taekwondo and novices indicated how they would subjectively split videos of Taekwondo form sequences into meaningful units. In previous research, this procedure was shown to unveil the structure of internal action representations and to be affected by sensorimotor knowledge. Without specific instructions on the grain size of segmentation, experts tended to integrate over longer episodes which resulted in a lower number of single units. Moreover, in accordance with studies in figure-skating and basketball, we expected higher agreement among experts on where to place segmentation marks, i.e., boundaries. In line with this hypothesis, significantly more overlap of boundaries was found within the expert group as compared to the control group. This was observed even though the interindividual differences in the selected grain size were huge and expertise had no systematic influence here. The absence of obvious goals or objects to structure Taekwondo forms underlines the importance of shared expert knowledge. Further, experts might have benefited from sensorimotor skills which allowed to simulate the observed actions more precisely. Both aspects may explain stronger agreement among experts even in unfamiliar Taekwondo forms. These interpretations are descriptively supported by the participants’ statements about features which guided segmentation and by an overlap of the group’s agreed boundaries with those of an experienced referee. The study shows that action segmentation can be used to provide insights into structure and content of action representations specific to experts. The mechanisms underlying shared knowledge among Taekwondoists and among experts in general are discussed on the background of current theoretic frameworks."

Water polo players utilise the egg beater motion (method of treading water with legs rotating like an ""egg beater""), and it is currently unclear what the relationship is between an egg beater and FAI morphology. Our objective was to associate hip range of motion during egg beater motion to MRI findings.Eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 varsity water polo athletes (5 females and 3 males) were filmed at orthogonal views performing the egg beater motion using two waterproof cameras in synchrony. A model-based image-matching technique was used to determine hip joint angles which were recorded from the software. These athletes also underwent noncontrast MRI scans of both hips using a 3T MRI scanner and completed an 33-item International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) hip pain outcomes questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are reported as counts and percentages for categorical variables and as means, standard deviations, and a five-number summary for continuous variables. Relationships between the range of motion measures with MRI measures and with iHOT33 scores were analysed using linear regression models. All statistical analyses were completes using a two-sided level of significance of 0.05.The average alpha angles for the right and left hips were 71.80 ±7.50 and 74.10 ±8.40, respectively. There was no statistically significant correlation between hip range of motion in any plane and alpha angle or lateral centre edge angle (CEA) on MRI. The average iHOT33 was 85.9 ± 18.9. Participants who had a labral tear had significantly smaller hip abduction ranges than participants who did not have a labral tear (29° ± 4.1 vs. 35.3° ± 0.6, p = 0.02), and those who had a labral tear had significantly increased hip flexion during egg beater kicking as compared with participants who did not have a labral tear (28.2° ± 6.1 vs. 16.3° ± 4, p = 0.02). There were no differences between right and left alpha angles or between right and left CEA.There were no significant correlations between hip range of motion and alpha angle or CEA, but hips with labral pathology had greater hip flexion and more limited hip abduction ranges."

However, there is no objective data establishing the direct relationship between pitching injuries and associated glenohumeral and scapular movements. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to demonstrate biomechanical differences in scapular and glenohumeral movements during pitching between injury-prone pitchers and healthy college baseball pitchers. Thirty collegiate baseball pitchers were classified into two groups according to their injury status: injury-prone group (N=15, 20.7±1.4 years, 180.1±6.5 cm, 78.9±5.4 kg) and control group (N=15, 20.9±1.1 years, 177.1±6.6 cm, 72.3±6.7 kg). We obtained the pitching motion data using the three-dimensional motion analysis technique with four high-speed cameras. The horizontal abduction angles of the glenohumeral joint during cocking and acceleration phases were significantly greater in injury-prone pitchers [19.0° (95% CI: 14.4–23.6) at foot contact, −4.0° (95% CI: −7.7 to −0.2) at maximum external rotation (MER), and −0.3° (95% CI: −4.8 to −4.2) at ball release] than in healthy controls [11.7 °(95%CI:7.1 to 16.3) at foot contact, −10.0°(95%CI: −13.7 to −6.3) at MER, and −6.9°(95%CI: −11.4 to −2.4)]( p &lt;0.01). In addition, the external rotation angle (ER) of the scapula at MER was significantly greater in the injury-prone group [−0.1° (95% CI: −5.0 to 4.8)] than in the control group [−12.3° (95% CI: −17.2 to −7.4)] (p&lt;0.01), but there was no difference in the scapular ER during foot contact between the two groups. These results suggests that injury-prone pitchers have less internal rotation of the scapula and more horizontal abduction of the glenohumeral joint during cocking and acceleration phases. Therefore, sports medicine practitioners may need to pay more attention to coordination of scapular and glenohumeral movements during the cocking and acceleration phases of pitching for prevention of shoulder injuries."

https://openalex.org/W3211454490,A portable isometric knee extensor strength testing device: test-retest reliability and minimal detectable change scores of the Q-Force ӀӀ in healthy adults,2021-11-19,2021,article,"Although knee extensors are essential in daily activities (e.g. walking, climbing stairs), knee extensor strength is often not measured in clinical settings. Existing devices to test muscle strength are not always suitable to accurately measure the high forces of this muscle group. Therefore, a device to test muscle strength that is convenient, feasible, reliable, and valid in clinical settings is required. This study evaluated the reliability, responsiveness, and level of discomfort of the newly developed Q-Force ӀӀ (i.e. a portable device to measure isometric knee extensor strength) in healthy middle-aged and elderly adults.Participants (n = 22) conducted two standardized test sessions on the Q-Force ӀӀ (five to ten days apart). Each session consisted of one familiarisation trial followed by three trials of peak isometric knee extension per each leg. Per trial, peak and mean knee extension force (N) and torque (Nm) were measured at 90° flexion. The level of discomfort was determined using a visual analog scale (VAS: 0-100). Intra Class Correlation (ICC, model: two-way mixed with absolute agreement), Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC) were determined. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine between-test variation.Excellent test-retest (ICC > 0.95) and inter-trial (ICC > 0.91) reliability for both legs were shown. No significant differences were found in peak and mean knee forces and torques between test and retest of both legs, indicating good test-retest reliability (P-value range: 0.360-0.538; F(1,21) range: 0.4-0.9). The SEM of the peak and mean forces and torques ranged from 28.0 to 30.4 N (6.0-6.8%) and from 9.2 to 10.4 Nm (6.4-7.7%), respectively. The MDC for these outcomes ranged respectively from 77.6 to 84.1 N (16.5-18.8%) and from 25.5 to 28.9 Nm (17.6-21.4%). The level of discomfort was low (median range: 7-10, IQR: 4-18).The portable Q-Force ӀӀ is a comfortable, responsive, and relatively cheap device with excellent test-retest reliability. This device would be potentially suitable to measure isometric knee extensor strength in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W4200046348,Origins of vocal-entangled gesture,2021-11-19,2021,preprint,"Humans move their upper limbs for communicative purposes during speaking. They gesture. Such movements interact on multiple levels with speaking. In connection to what is said, gestures meaningfully shape with varying means of representation. Yet, gestures also have non-representational aspects; they quasi-rhythmically pulse with prosodic structure in speech. In explaining how modern human gesturing practices emerge in phylogeny or ontogeny, it is undisputed that gestures proliferated because they provide particularly effective means to refer to absent or distal state of affairs. It suggested that displaced or deictic reference is gestures' most basic proper function. The upshot is that the non-representational pulsing quality of gesture is completely ignored as something a) that requires an explanation or b) something that can elucidate how gesture practices emerged from more basic beginnings shared with other animals. However, recent research provides evidence for direct biomechanical interaction between pulsing manual movements and respiratory-vocal activity. We argue that this physical link is enacted during infant vocal-motor babbling - way before infants learn to represent manually. Further, we argue that gesture-vocal biomechanics directly relates to the cross-species phenomenon of locomotor-respiratory(-vocal) coupling. Given that gesture-speech biomechanics has its roots in locomotor-respiratory coupling, it can be related to bipedalism and respiratory complexification, i.e., an adaptation for the faculty of speech. We conclude that the physical origins of vocal-entangled gesture run much deeper and unfolded more gradually than currently assumed. The entanglement of sound and movement arose out of natural physical coalitions between vocal, respiratory, and limb systems that are forced to interact. We thus invert current argumentation of how gesture and vocalization must have evolved and rethink what is foundational of human gesture. This perspective underlines that a more comprehensive investigation of the physical basis of bodily communication can yield new sources of semiotic significance in human and non-human animals."

Implications for Performance and Hamstring Injury Management,2021-11-18,2021,article,"Sprint kinematics have been linked to hamstring injury and performance. This study aimed to examine if a specific 6-week multimodal intervention, combining lumbopelvic control and unning technique exercises, induced changes in pelvis and lower-limb kinematics at maximal speed and improved sprint performance.Healthy amateur athletes were assigned to a control or intervention group (IG). A sprint test with 3-dimensional kinematic measurements was performed before (PRE) and after (POST) 6 weeks of training. The IG program included 3 weekly sessions integrating coaching, strength and conditioning, and physical therapy approaches (eg, manual therapy, mobility, lumbopelvic control, strength and sprint ""front-side mechanics""-oriented drills).Analyses of variance showed no between-group differences at PRE. At POST, intragroup analyses showed PRE-POST differences for the pelvic (sagittal and frontal planes) and thigh kinematics and improved sprint performance (split times) for the IG only. Specifically, IG showed (1) a lower anterior pelvic tilt during the late swing phase, (2) greater pelvic obliquity on the free-leg side during the early swing phase, (3) higher vertical position of the front-leg knee, (4) an increase in thigh angular velocity and thigh retraction velocity, (5) lower between-knees distance at initial contact, and (6) a shorter ground contact duration. The intergroup analysis revealed disparate effects (possibly to very likely) in the most relevant variables investigated.The 6-week multimodal training program induced clear pelvic and lower-limb kinematic changes during maximal speed sprinting. These alterations may collectively be associated with reduced risk of muscle strain and were concomitant with significant sprint performance improvement."

The aim of this study was to assess the associations of the mechanical variables derived from the FV relationship with approach jump, linear sprint and change of direction (CoD) ability in young male volleyball players. Thirty-seven participants performed countermovement jumps with incremental loads from bodyweight to 50-100 kg (depending on the individual capabilities), 25-m sprint with split times being recorded for the purpose of FV relationship calculation, two CoD tests (505 test and modified T-test) and approach jump. Results in this study show that approach jump performance seems to be influenced by maximal power output (r = 0.53) and horizontal force production (r = 0.51) in sprinting, as well as force capacity in jumping (r = 0.45). Only the FV variables obtained from sprinting alone contributed to explaining linear sprinting and CoD ability (r = 0.35-0.93). An interesting finding is that sprinting FV variables have similar and some even stronger correlation with approach jump performance than jumping FV variables, which needs to be considered for volleyball training optimization. Based on the results of this study it seems that parameters that refer to horizontal movement capacity are important for volleyball athletic performance. Further interventional studies are needed to check how to implement specific FV-profile-based training programs to improve specific mechanical capabilities that determine volleyball athletic performance and influence the specific physical performance of volleyball players."

PubMed, SPORTDiscuss, and Scopus databases were searched until September 10, 2021, with no restriction of published data. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guided the study's screening and quality assessment performed by an external reviewer using a 16-checklist item. A search of the databases identified 125 studies, but only eight were eligible, including a total sample of 117 male athletes. Four reports only associated mechanical or technical parameters with the performance of the paddler. Concerning the remaining studies, only one correlated physiological data, and the others associated more than one parameter with race time. Most of the eligible reports presented significant associations between mechanical/physiological components and slalom performance. Eligible studies support that high-force development during a slalom race is a relevant parameter for performance. Aerobic metabolism is highly required during slalom tasks and is inversely associated with race time, although it may not increase the chances of winning medals. Few reports have associated canoe slalom performance with technical components, and further research should focus on this matter."
https://openalex.org/W4387499323,Applying safe flooring in housing environments related to the independent elderly : evaluating suitability flooring technology to absorb impact in the event of a fall,2021-11-18,2021,dissertation,"This research has been developed with the intention of investigating a different generation of pavements. Most of the current pavements have the same basic standard characteristics and this ensures that living conditions are comfortable, safe, and pleasant for the majority of citizens. But a small group of pavements is designed with a specific purpose: to reduce injuries related to people's falls to the ground; They are called CF (compliant flooring in English). A detailed study of CF flooring systems is warranted to assess their usability for vulnerable groups such as the elderly. This study is structured in six chapters. The first chapter has dealt mainly with bibliographic studies and statistical data consulted on official and international websites. This section evaluates the importance of the increase in the elderly population, life expectancy, and threats to the safety and health of the elderly, especially, and their secondary effects. The scope of the research has been carried out internationally, in Europe and within Spain, and finally, specifically for Catalonia. The second chapter presents a brief overview of the interior flooring, specifically considering its comfort and safety during use. The importance and direct relationship between the sole of the foot and the gait mechanism with respect to the type of pavement have been verified. Many factors that influence this have been investigated, such as the physics and biomechanics of the body when walking, the kinematics of falls, and the dynamics of impact. In addition, a general description of the behavior of materials for use in pavements has been made to better understand the behavior of CF systems. In addition, the most suitable strategies to cope with falls and reduce injuries are discussed. Examining other products with appreciable energy-absorbing and shock-reducing capabilities has been helpful in the proposed pre-designs, all of which have been made based on numerical analysis and related standards. The third chapter is already dedicated to the study of technology and research on the most suitable CF systems; studies from academic, commercial, and architecture departments, in general, are included. In this section, some standard tests related to the various selected materials are developed and several examples of similar products are studied. The fourth chapter includes field research (on-site) and analysis of case studies. Several notable flooring companies around the world were contacted by mail, specifically examining those products whose manufacturers claimed to be shock absorbers. This part of the investigation was slowed down by the delay in shipments. Once they arrived, a real environment was sought where they could obtain the opinion of the elderly and the personnel assigned to their care. All the practice tests were carried out in a residence for the elderly in Barcelona for about two months, focusing on the study of the current pavements of the center and the current derived problems related to users.This entire process was completed by interviewing users and caregivers with predefined questionnaires. It should be noted that this allowed us to contrast the quantitative characteristics of the study in combination with the elements of qualitative research. Chapter Five deals with the results, discussions, suggestions for installation and improvement of pavement safety in risk areas. Simulations were also carried out on a possible base structure of the pavements with the finite element method (FEM). Chapter six presents guidelines for future developments. The author further investigated the materials and their structure and is presented them as a basis for future technical developments.The author considers that, with more detailed studies, it would be possible to use as CF system other materials, either natural or recycled based on agricultural products, which would increase the diversity of the CF system offer and promote more sustainable architecture Esta investigación se ha desarrollado con la intención de investigar una generación diferente de pavimentos. La mayoría de los actuales pavimentos tienen las mismas características básicas estándar y ello garantiza que las condiciones de vida sean cómodas, seguras y agradables para la mayoría de los ciudadanos. Pero un grupo reducido de pavimentos está diseñado con un propósito específico: reducir las lesiones relacionadas con las caídas al suelo de las personas; son los denominados CF (compliant flooring en inglés). Un estudio detallado de los sistemas de pavimentos CF está justificado para evaluar su posibilidad de uso para grupos vulnerables como los ancianos. Este estudio se estructura en seis capítulos. En el primer capítulo se han abordado principalmente los estudios bibliográficos y datos estadísticos consultados en sitios web oficiales e internacionales. En esta sección se evalúa la importancia del aumento de la población anciana. El ámbito de la investigación se ha realizado a nivel internacional, en Europa y dentro de España, y finalmente, específicamente para Cataluña. El segundo capítulo se presenta una breve panorámica del pavimento interior. Se ha constatado la importancia y relación directa entre la planta del pie y el mecanismo de andar con respecto al tipo de pavimento. Se han investigado muchos factores que influyen en ello. Además, se ha realizado una descripción general del comportamiento de los materiales al uso en pavimentos para comprender mejor el comportamiento de los sistemas de CF. Además, se discuten las estrategias más idóneas para hacer frente a las caídas y reducir las lesiones. Examinar otros productos con apreciables capacidades de amortiguación de energía y reducción de impactos ha sido de gran ayuda en los prediseños propuestos, todos los cuales se han realizado sobre la base de análisis numérico y los estándares relacionados. El tercer capítulo está dedicado ya al estudio de la tecnología y la investigación sobre los sistemas de C más idóneos; se incluyen estudios procedentes de departamentos académicos, comerciales y de arquitectura en general. En esta sección se desarrollan algunas pruebas estándar relacionadas con los diversos materiales seleccionados y se estudian varios ejemplos de productos similares. El cuarto capítulo incluye investigación de campo (in situ) y análisis de estudios de casos. Se contactó por correo con varias empresas notables de pavimentos en todo el mundo, y se examinaron específicamente aquellos productos cuyos fabricantes afirmaban ser amortiguadores. Esta parte de la investigación se vio ralentizada por la demora en los envíos. Una vez llegados se buscó un ámbito real donde poder recabar la opinión de las personas mayores y del personal adscrito a su cuidado. Todas las pruebas prácticas se realizaron en una residencia de ancianos de Barcelona durante unos dos meses, centrándose en el estudio de los actuales pavimentos del centro y los problemas actuales derivados relacionados con los usuarios. Todo este proceso se completó mediante entrevistas a usuarios y cuidadores con cuestionarios predefinidos. El Capítulo Cinco se refiere a los resultados, discusiones, sugerencias para la instalación y mejora de la seguridad del pavimento en áreas de riesgo. También se realizaron simulaciones sobre una posible estructura base de los pavimentos con el método elemento finito (FEM). El capítulo seis presenta directrices para desarrollos futuros. El autor investigó más a fondo sobre los materiales y su estructura, y se presenta como una base para desarrollos técnicos futuros. El autor considera que, con estudios más detallados, sería posible utilizar como CF otros materiales, bien naturales o reciclados a base de productos agrícolas, lo cual aumentaría la diversidad de la oferta de CF y fomentaría la arquitectura más sostenible."

However, there currently exists a gap in the literature surrounding the use of interval programs for the rehabilitation of punting and place-kicking athletes. We aim to perform a systematic review of the literature examining the use of interval kicking programs to aid punting and place-kicking athletes following a lower-extremity injury. Following PRISMA guidelines, a review was performed using PubMed and MEDLINE databases to evaluate the literature surrounding interval kicking programs for punting and place-kicking athletes. Search terms were combined using Boolean operators of “AND” and “OR”. Articles included in this review met these criteria: 1) included patients with lower-extremity pain/injury, 2) reported a return to sport progressive program, and 3) analyzed the measure’s ability to predict a successful return to sport. The initial search returned 115 articles. Seventy-nine of these articles were excluded after initial screening, leaving 36 full-text articles for final review. Of these final articles, there were no studies outlining the use of interval kicking programs by punting or place-kicking athletes. Of the articles reviewed, the most relevant was an interval kicking program developed by Arundale et al. specifically for the soccer athlete. Punting and place-kicking use biomechanically distinct patterns of movement, warranting a specific interval program. This review identified a gap in knowledge surrounding the use of interval programs in the rehabilitation of punting and place-kicking athletes. This review will now describe what is currently known regarding biomechanics of punting and place kicking, the injuries experienced by these athletes, and the benefit an individualized interval program could provide. There currently exists a gap in the literature surrounding the use of interval programs for the rehabilitation of punting and place-kicking athletes. The biomechanics and application of these skills are distinct, and an interval program designed specifically for these athletes is warranted. Future research should be dedicated to the development, implementation, and analysis of an interval kicking program designed for these athletes."

However, biomechanics of DVJ should differ with type of various sporting activities. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether biomechanical features of DVJ are different among various sporting activities in female athletes. Methods: A total of 42 female athletes, including 25 basketball, 8 soccer and 9 volleyball players, participated in the current investigation. DVJ was done for each female athlete using a three-dimensional motion analysis system which consisted of six cameras, two force plates and 46 retro-reflective markers. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded for both limbs in each athlete. Simultaneously, frontal and sagittal plane views of the DVJ were recorded using high-resolution two different video cameras to evaluate Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) score. Three-dimensional biomechanical parameters at the knee joint and LESS were compared among three different sporting activities. Results: Soccer players had better LESS score, compared to basketball players, while no significantly differences were found between basketball and volleyball players in LESS. In addition, peak knee flexion angle was significantly larger, and knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC), peak knee abduction angle, knee internal rotation angle, and knee abduction moment within 40 milliseconds from IC were significantly smaller in soccer players, compared to basketball players. There were no significantly differences between basketball and volleyball players in all biomechanical parameters. Conclusions: From the present study, female basketball and volleyball players have worse LESS score, greater knee abduction angle and moment, compared to female soccer players. Thus, female basketball and volleyball players are likely to have the increased risk of non-contact ACL injury during DVJ, compared to soccer players. DVJ may be useless as a screening tool of non-contact ACL injury for soccer players. Biomechanics of DVJ depends on characteristics of the athlete's primary sport."

Little is currently known about the ability for OMTs to reduce gait asymmetries, thereby reducing the risk of injury, accelerated disease progression, and suboptimal recovery.To demonstrate whether osteopathic screening and treatment could alter movement and loading asymmetry during treadmill walking.Forty-two healthy adults (20 males, 22 females) between the ages of 18 and 35 were recruited for this prospective intervention. Standardized osteopathic screening exams were completed by a single physician for each participant, and osteopathic manipulation was performed targeting somatic dysfunctions identified in the screening exam. Three-dimensional (3-D) biomechanical assessments, including the collection of motion capture and force plate data, were performed prior to and following osteopathic manipulation to quantify gait mechanics. Motion capture and loading data were processed utilizing Qualisys Track Manager and Visual 3D software, respectively. Asymmetry in the following temporal, kinetic, and kinematic measures was quantified utilizing a limb symmetry index (LSI): peak vertical ground reaction force, the impulse of the vertical ground reaction force, peak knee flexion angle, step length, stride length, and stance time. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance model was utilized to evaluate the effects of time (pre/post manipulation) and sex (male/female) on each measure of gait asymmetry.Gait asymmetry in the peak vertical ground reaction force (-0.6%, p=0.025) and the impulse of the vertical ground reaction force (-0.3%, p=0.026) was reduced in males following osteopathic manipulation. There was no difference in gait asymmetry between time points in females. Osteopathic manipulation did not impact asymmetry in peak knee flexion angle, step length, stride length, or stance time. Among the participants, 59.5% (25) followed the common compensatory pattern, whereas 40.5% (17) followed the uncommon compensatory pattern. One third (33.3%, 14) of the participants showed decompensation at the occipitoatlantal (OA) junction, whereas 26.2% (11), one third (33.3%, 14), and 26.2% (11) showed decompensation at the cervicothoracic (CT), thoracolumbar (TL), and lumbosacral (LS) junctions, respectively. Somatic dysfunction at the sacrum, L5, right innominate, and left innominate occurred in 88.1% (37), 69.0% (29), 97.6% (41), and 97.6% (41) of the participants, respectively.Correcting somatic dysfunction can influence gait asymmetry in males; the sex-specificity of the observed effects of osteopathic manipulation on gait asymmetry is worthy of further investigation. Osteopathic structural examinations and treatment of somatic dysfunctions may improve gait symmetry even in asymptomatic individuals. These findings encourage larger-scale investigations on the use of OMT to optimize gait, prevent injury and the progression of disease, and aid in recovery after surgery."

The current prospective cohort study aims to evaluate potential risk-factors, propose a criteria-based conservative rehabilitation protocol and assess return-to-play outcomes among professional youth soccer players suffering from long-standing pubic-related groin pain. Methods: Male soccer players with long-standing (> 6 weeks) pubic-related groin pain from a professional soccer club’s youth academy were analyzed for possible risk factors such as age, team (U12 - U23), younger/older age group within the team, position and preinjury Functional movement score. All injured players received a conservative, standardized, supervised, criteria-based, 6-level rehabilitation program. Outcome measures included time to return to play, recurrent groin pain in the follow-up period and clinical results at final follow-up two years after their return to play. Results: A total of 14 out of 189 players developed long-standing pubic-related groin pain in the 2017/2018 season (incidence 7.4%). The average age of the players at the time of the injury was 16.1 ± 1.9 years. Risk factor analysis revealed a significant influence of the age group within the team (p =.007). Only players in the younger age group were affected by long-standing pubic-related groin pain, mainly in the first part of the season. Injured players successfully returned to play after an average period of 135.3 ± 83.9 days. Only one player experienced a recurrence of nonspecific symptoms (7.1%) within the follow-up period. The outcome at the 24-month follow-up was excellent for all 14 players. Conclusions: Long-standing pubic-related groin pain is an overuse entity with a markedly high prevalence in youth soccer players, resulting in a relevant loss of time in training and match play. In particular, the youngest players in each team are at an elevated risk. Applying a criteria-based rehabilitation protocol resulted in an excellent return-to-play rate, with a very low probability of recurrence. Trial registration: The trial was retrospectively registered under DRKS00016510 in the German Clinical Trials Register on 19.04.2021."

Unfortunately, the majority of publications are case reports/case series or study single impairment types in isolation. Indeed, an overview of how each International Paralympic Committee classifiable impairment type impact athlete physiology, health, and performance has not been forthcoming in the literature. This can make it challenging for practitioners to appropriately support para-athletes and implement evidence-based research in their daily practice. Moreover, the lack of a cohesive publication that reviews all classifiable impairment types through a physiological lens can make it challenging for researchers new to the field to gain an understanding of unique physiological challenges facing para-athletes and to appreciate the nuances of how various impairment types differentially impact para-athlete physiology. As such, the purpose of this review is to (1) summarize how International Paralympic Committee classifiable impairments alter the normal physiological responses to exercise; (2) provide an overview of ""quick win"" physiological interventions targeted toward specific para-athlete populations; (3) discuss unique practical considerations for the para-sport practitioner; (4) discuss research gaps and highlight areas for future research and innovation, and (5) provide suggestions for knowledge translation and knowledge sharing strategies to advance the field of para-sport research and its application by para-sport practitioners."

We obtained and reviewed 37 of 57 (65%) injury videos to establish the injury mechanism, situational pattern, and knee flexion angle. We used detailed biomechanical analysis to assess the indirect and noncontact injuries. Injury layoff times, timing of injuries during the match, and location of the injuries on the pitch were also reported.Twenty-three (62%) injuries were direct contact, 9 (24%) were indirect contact, and 5 (14%) were noncontact. Three main sprain mechanisms were noted: (1) direct contact/blow to the knee (n = 16), (2) contact to the leg or foot (lever like) (n = 7), and (3) sliding (n = 9). Seventy-three percent of MCL injuries occurred during 2 main situations: (1) pressing/tackling (n = 14, 38%) and (2) being tackled (n = 13, 35%). For indirect and noncontact injuries, knee valgus loading (100% of cases), hip abduction (73% of cases), and external foot rotation (92% of cases) were prominent injury kinematics, often with lateral trunk tilt (median, 10°; 64% of cases) and rotation (64% of cases). Knee flexion angles were higher for indirect and noncontact injuries (median, 100°) than for direct-contact injuries (median, 22°; P<.01).Nearly two thirds of MCL injuries occurred after direct contact; 1 in every 4 MCL injuries occurred after indirect contact.

Most studies investigating kicking performance have been conducted with male athletes, resulting in a dearth of specific data to inform coaching of this skill in female players. This systematic review aimed to compare kicking biomechanics in male and female athletes in field-based sports. As per PRISMA guidelines, articles were retrieved from searches across five online databases. Studies investigating kicking biomechanics in field-based athletes of both sexes were eligible for inclusion. Articles were screened using Covidence and data extracted based on STROBE recommendations. The review included 23 studies, featuring 455 soccer players. Male athletes produced significantly greater ball velocities and linear velocities of the ankle, foot, and toe than females. Males had greater ankle plantarflexion angles than females at ball strike, while females used larger trunk flexion ranges than males. Hip and knee torques and ball-to-foot velocity ratios were greater in men than women. Skilled players generated power using tension arcs; a technique not seen in novices. Skill level within sex may have a greater influence on kicking performance than differences between the sexes. This review highlights the need for further research investigating kicking performance in both sexes across the spectrum of sports."

The objective of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of the attack of the Chilean National Goalball League, according to type of shot and trajectory. Four Goalball matches of the final phase of a national tournament were filmed. For this, a digital camera was used behind an arch located in height. The matches were analyzed following the diagrams proposed by Morato et al. (2016) and Morato (2012). The front throw (FRO) was used the most (88.9%) with an effectiveness rate of 6.2%. Longer trajectories were made in short diagonals (SD) and parallel (PA) (31.3% and 23.2%, respectively). The FRO throw was directed in SD (34.5%) and PA (22.4%), while on the other hand, the spinning throws (SP) were directed preferably in PA (30.4%) and SD (29.1%). The FRO throw was more effective in PA (10.6%), whereas the SP throw was more effective in the middle diagonal (MD) (12.5%). The lateral positions execute throws, preferably FRO, but in defense the central positions are protagonists. Throws are most effective when they are directed in PA and SD."

Methods: Databases of PubMed, Ovid-Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM were searched for literature in July 2021. Screening of search results, data extraction, and literature quality evaluation were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Results and discussion: Seven articles were selected for the meta-analysis. The results showed that the mechanical properties of the femoral-tendon graft–tibia complex fixed with magnesium and its alloys were comparable to those fixed with titanium and its alloys, and magnesium and its alloys were superior to titanium and its alloys in promoting new bone formation. In addition, the unique biodegradability made magnesium and its alloys an orthopedic implant with significant therapeutic potential. However, whether the degradation rate of magnesium and its alloy can match the rate of bone-tendon integration, and whether the bioconjugation of bone-tendon after degradation can meet the exercise load still needs to be explored in further detail. Simultaneously, it is necessary for future research to improve and standardize experimental design, result measurement, etc., so as to minimize the risk of transforming animal experimental results into clinical practice."

One of the most commonly used test batteries for interpreting the characteristics of an injury is the Functional Movement Screen (FMSTM). It makes possible to possible to identify movement limitations and asymmetries which are believed to impact injury risk in sports. The aim of this study is to use the FMSTM to determine whether an eight-week training protocol can predict and prevent injuries in handball. The study sample comprised the fifteen members of the Borac handball club youth team. The initial measurement showed that most players (80%) had an overall score in the test battery ranging from 15 to 20 points. In addition, three players were found to have asymmetry. Only one of the three players had an overall score in the FMSTM of ≤14. The participants scored the lowest in the initial measurement for Rotary Stability, followed by Deep Squat and Hurdle Step Left. They scored the highest in the Shoulder Mobility. After the implementation of the exercise protocol for improving body mobility and stability, the final measurements showed that all the participants had an overall score in the FMSTM of &gt;14. The value of eta squared showed that training in between the two measurements had a significant impact. At the time of testing and protocol implementation no players sustained any injuries during matches or in training. This study confirmed that the FMSTM can be used to predict injuries in sports."
https://openalex.org/W4200221411,Occupational Exposure Assessment Tools in Europe: A Comprehensive Inventory Overview,2021-11-15,2021,review,"Abstract Objectives The Network on the Coordination and Harmonisation of European Occupational Cohorts (OMEGA-NET) was set up to enable optimization of the use of industrial and general population cohorts across Europe to advance aetiological research. High-quality harmonized exposure assessment is crucial to derive comparable results and to enable pooled analyses. To facilitate a harmonized research strategy, a concerted effort is needed to catalogue available occupational exposure information. We here aim to provide a first comprehensive overview of exposure assessment tools that could be used for occupational epidemiological studies. Methods An online inventory was set up to collect meta-data on exposure assessment tools. Occupational health researchers were invited via newsletters, editorials, and individual e-mails to provide details of job-exposure matrices (JEMs), exposure databases, and occupational coding systems and their associated crosswalks to translate codes between different systems, with a focus on Europe. Results Meta-data on 36 general population JEMs, 11 exposure databases, and 29 occupational coding systems from more than 10 countries have been collected up to August 2021. A wide variety of exposures were covered in the JEMs on which data were entered, with dusts and fibres (in 14 JEMs) being the most common types. Fewer JEMs covered organization of work (5) and biological factors (4). Dusts and fibres were also the most common exposures included in the databases (7 out of 11), followed by solvents and pesticides (both in 6 databases). Conclusions This inventory forms the basis for a searchable web-based database of meta-data on existing occupational exposure information, to support researchers in finding the available tools for assessing occupational exposures in their cohorts, and future efforts for harmonization of exposure assessment. This inventory remains open for further additions, to enlarge its coverage and include newly developed tools."
https://openalex.org/W3211971626,Structural Discrimination in Physical Education. The “Encounter” Between the (White) Norwegian Teaching Content in Physical Education Lessons and Female Students of Color's Movements and Expressions,2021-11-15,2021,article,"Background: Throughout society, including in the field of sports and physical education (PE), there are extensive debates on racism and structural racism. Researchers have found that students of color experience racial stereotyping and discrimination in PE. Studies also show that PE teaching practices reflect a masculine culture, emphasizing traditional (Western) competitive male sports and physical fitness practices, while marginalizing female students of color. Simultaneously these students also negotiate, resist, and operate as visible agents within these practices. While previous research has tended toward focusing on the experiences (of discrimination) from the perspective of students of color, numerous scholars today argue for a shift in research focus from the inadequacies of the racialized ""others"" toward how (white) everyday pedagogical practices privilege some people, and conversely, marginalize and discriminate against students of color. We believe, however, that it is crucial to examine and direct attention toward the students who ""encounter"" discriminatory practices in PE. The Purpose of the Paper is Twofold: (i) To investigate what kind of movements, knowledge/skills and bodies are valued and privileged, or ignored/discriminated in teaching practices in PE. (ii) To depict the ""encounter"" between the teaching content in physical education lessons and the female students of color's movements and expressions. Research Design and Production of Empirical Material: Our sample consisted of institutionalized pedagogical practices enacted by four white PE teachers in an upper secondary school located in eastern Oslo, Norway. The empirical material consisted of observations and informal conversations extracted from 42 teaching lessons. Students from a great diversity of backgrounds participated in the lessons during our study. We chose a critical whiteness perspective and critical feminist theory as analytical lenses for the analyses. Findings: Strenuous exercise as a means of becoming physically fit and ""healthy"" was central during the PE lessons under observation. The teacher's instructions draw on healthism discourses influenced by knowledge from exercise physiology and biomechanics, which produce a normative ideal for the body and movements in PE teaching practice. The movements and expressions of female students of color did not meet the expected norm of intensity, activity and exercises from the health and sport discourses. However, we identified female students of color as competent movers when performing ""their own"" movements, with which they had more of a cultural connection. These students also expressed vitality, joy and social interaction. Thus, they created new movements and expressions that contrasted with the norm of working out with a high intensity level in PE lessons. Conclusion: Hegemonic ""truths"" about the body, physical exercise and health make teachers ""blind"" to the ways that institutionalized pedagogical practices in PE privilege majority ethnic white (male) students. Refusing to adhere to the institutionalized movement/exercise practices enacted by the teachers, the female students of color are competent dancers and express liveliness, spontaneity, and joy. In the future, incorporating these types of expressions to teaching practices can add value to PE."
https://openalex.org/W3212854562,Methodological implications of adapting and applying a web-based questionnaire on health problems to adolescent football players,2021-11-15,2021,article,"Abstract Background The Oslo Sport Trauma Research Centre Questionnaire on Health Problems (OSTRC-H) has become a popular tool to monitor health status in athletes. Originally developed for adult athletes, the tool is today also being used in adolescent athletes. However, little is known on the suitability of the questionnaire for the adolescent age group and the methodological implications of applying the tool to prospectively monitor illness and injury. To address this gap in methodological knowledge, the aim of this study is to outline and discuss the adaption and application process of the OSTRC-H to adolescent football players. Method The adaption process included a slightly modified back-translation method to translate the questionnaire. The application process included a web-based version of the Swedish OSTRC-H sent out once a week over 23 weeks to 115 adolescent football players aged 10-19 attending two football schools in Sweden. The response rate and prevalence of health problems over 23 weeks were calculated as feasibility indicators. Additionally, comprehensibility questions were added to the questionnaire in the end of the study. Result No major disagreement was found between the original and translated versions of the questionnaire. However, significant changes to the wording of the questions and answer categories were necessary to adapt it to adolescents. A visual body figure was also added. The average weekly response rate was 38% (SD 13.5). To increase this rate, questionnaire data was gathered retrospectively through telephone and email contact with the participants and their parents, elevating the response rate to 53% (SD 15.5). The adolescents experienced the questionnaire as easy to understand and to cover all relevant health problems. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the importance of adapting the questionnaire to the adolescent target group through translation, pre-tests, adjustments of wording and the facilitation of answering the questionnaire using a visual body figure. The study further shows the importance of keeping close and personal contact with the participants, their parents, teachers, and coaches throughout data collection. Future studies should take into account the age group and study context when adapting and applying the OSTRC-H to adolescents."

Type of impairment and high-performance training are factors that contribute to the development of sports injuries. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the prevalence of sports-related injuries in visually disabled athletes of the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer team. Methods: The method was defined as a descriptive, longitudinal, epidemiological study. The sample was composed of ten male athletes, members of the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer team, including two athletes without VI and eight athletes with the B1 visual classification, who participated in competitions in 2014. The questionnaire for the data collection was based on the Sport Injuries Protocol for Paralympic Sports (PLEEP), expressing quantitative data analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: The results showed that, in 2014, five athletes with VI had seven sports injuries, with a prevalence of 62.5%, clinical incidence of 0.87 injuries per athlete per year, and 1.4 injuries per injured athlete. The main sports injuries were muscle strain (28.6%), groin pull (athletic pubalgia) (28.6%), and shin splints (periostitis) (28.6%). All sports injuries occurred in the lower limbs, affecting legs (71.4%) and hips (28.6%). Overload was the most frequent mechanism (57%), reported after the technical kick movement and linked to the muscle imbalance between dominant and supporting lower limbs, in addition to the postural misalignment typical of people with visual impairments. Conclusions: In summary, the Brazilian 5-a-side soccer athletes presented a pattern of overload injuries resulting from the repetition of the technical kick movement, occurring predominantly in sports competitions. Epidemiological data can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent injuries in this sport. Level of evidence II, Progressive prognostic study."

However, there is little literature that analyses the behaviour of muscle coactivation in runners, describing the effect between two techniques associated with the initial contact, such as the use of rearfoot (RF) and forefoot (FF). Material and method: The purpose of this study was to compare muscle coactivation levels developed in the lower limb during two running techniques, FF vs RF. Fourteen amateur runners were evaluated (eight men, six women; age= 23.21 ± 3.58 years, mass= 63.89 ± 8.13 kg, height= 1.68 ± 0.08m). Surface electromyography was used to measure muscle activity during both running techniques evaluated on a treadmill, considering the muscle pairs: Rectus femoris- Biceps femoris (RFe-BF), Lateral Gastrocnemius–Tibialis Anterior (LG-TA), and Medial Gastrocnemius - Tibialis Anterior (MG-TA). These were calculated in three windows considering ten running cycles (0-5%, 80-100%, and 0-100%). To compare FF vs RF t-student test for paired data was used. Results: It was observed significant differences in the MG-TA pair (FF= 18.42 ± 11.84% vs RF = 39.05 ± 13.28%, p = 0.0018 during 0-5%, and RFe-BF pair (FF = 42.38 ± 18.11% vs RF = 28.37 ± 17.2%, p = 0.0331) during 80-100% of the race. Conclusion: Our findings show that the behaviour of muscle coactivation is different between FF vs RF techniques if we analyze little windows in the running cycle. This could be associated with an increase in the joint stability between these short intervals, represented in the initial and final regions of the running cycle."

Clinical subjective evaluation included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Lysholm knee score, and visual analog scale (VAS). The knee joint scores were evaluated according to the Lysholm score. Clinical objective assessment included the Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), IKDC, and the range of motion. The patient's quality of life was measured using a life summary table. Assessment of fracture healing and internal fixation was performed on lateral X-rays of the knee joint. The patients’ satisfaction was measured and evaluated at the last follow-up in accordance with Marsh criteria. RESULTS: There were 22 patients (22 knees) with a mean age of 33.64 ± 8.60 years. The mean follow-up was 28.36 ± 2.79 months. The difference in Lachman test and ADT before and after the operation was statistically significant. According to the IKDC classification, there were 11 cases with type A, 9 cases with type B, and 2 cases with type C. According to the intra-articular button position classification, the rate of ideal position was 100%. The satisfaction rate was 81.8%.CONCLUSIONS: Day surgery using double-button plates to treat TEF can achieve anatomical reduction, power and stability, and good clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3212883655,Optimal mechanical force‐velocity profile for sprint acceleration performance,2021-11-14,2021,article,"The aim was to determine the respective influences of sprinting maximal power output ( PHmax ) and mechanical Force-velocity (F-v) profile (ie, ratio between horizontal force production capacities at low and high velocities) on sprint acceleration performance. A macroscopic biomechanical model using an inverse dynamics approach applied to the athlete's center of mass during running acceleration was developed to express the time to cover a given distance as a mathematical function of PHmax and F-v profile. Simulations showed that sprint acceleration performance depends mainly on PHmax , but also on the F-v profile, with the existence of an individual optimal F-v profile corresponding, for a given PHmax , to the best balance between force production capacities at low and high velocities. This individual optimal profile depends on PHmax and sprint distance: the lower the sprint distance, the more the optimal F-v profile is oriented to force capabilities and vice versa. When applying this model to the data of 231 athletes from very different sports, differences between optimal and actual F-v profile were observed and depend more on the variability in the optimal F-v profile between sprint distances than on the interindividual variability in F-v profiles. For a given sprint distance, acceleration performance (<30 m) mainly depends on PHmax and slightly on the difference between optimal and actual F-v profile, the weight of each variable changing with sprint distance. Sprint acceleration performance is determined by both maximization of the horizontal power output capabilities and the optimization of the mechanical F-v profile of sprint propulsion."

https://openalex.org/W3214526819,The burden of injuries according to maturity status and timing: A two‐decade study with 110 growth curves in an elite football academy,2021-11-12,2021,article,"Injuries have a negative impact on the development of football players. Maturation is a potential risk factor for football injuries but available data on this topic provide limited evidence due to methodological shortcomings. The aim of this study was to describe the injury burden of male academy football players according to growth curve-derived maturity status and timing. Injury and growth data were collected from 2000 to 2020. Longitudinal height records for 110 individual players were fitted with the Super-Imposition by Translation and Rotation model to estimate age at peak height velocity (PHV). Players were clustered according to maturity status (pre-, circa-, post-PHV, or adults) and timing (early, on-time, late maturers). Overall and specific injury burdens (days lost/player-season) and rate ratios for comparisons between groups were calculated. Overall injury burden increased with advanced maturity status; pre-PHV players had 3.2-, 3.7-, and 5.5-times lower burden compared with circa-PHV, post-PHV, and adult players, respectively. Growth-related injuries were more burdensome circa-PHV, while muscle and joint/ligament injuries had a higher impact post-PHV and in adults. Further, in the pre-PHV period, late maturers showed lower burden of overall, growth-related, anterior inferior iliac spine osteochondrosis, and knee joint/ligament injuries compared with on-time maturers. In adult players, however, injuries were less burdensome for early maturers than on-time and late maturers. In addition, joint/ligament injuries of adult late maturers were 4.5-times more burdensome than those of early maturers. Therefore, monitoring maturity seems crucial to define each player's maturation profile and facilitate design of targeted injury prevention programmes.Highlights Injury burden is significantly lower in football players at pre-peak height velocity (PHV). Growth-related injuries are most burdensome circa-PHV, while muscle and joint/ligament injuries are more burdensome post-PHV and especially in adults.Before PHV, growth-related and knee joint/ligament injuries have lower burden in players who mature late than those who mature on-time. Adult late maturers have greater burden of overall and joint/ligament injuries than early maturers.Football academies should regularly assess the maturity status and timing of young football players, as the impact of injuries varies with maturation status and timing.Management of the maturity-related injury risk profile, in combination with other relevant factors (training load, neuromuscular and biomechanical factors, physiotherapy, coaching, communication, psychosocial factors …), might help improve the success of player development programmes and protect the health of young football players."

However, there is still insufficient evidence on whether to repair the DL in acute ankle fracture. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies was performed to report the outcome of DL repair in acute ankle fracture. Methods The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched from the inception dates to October 31, 2020, for comparative studies. The methodological quality was evaluated based on the risk-of-bias tool of the Cochrane Collaboration for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) or the Risk-of-Bias Assessment Tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS). The post-operative medial clear space (MCS), final MCS, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, visual analogue scale (VAS) score and incidence of complications were analysed. Results A total of 8 comparative studies involving 388 participants who suffered Weber type B or C ankle fractures were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the post-operative MCS, final MCS, AOFAS score and rate of complications were statistically superior in the DL repair group. For the VAS score, there was no significant difference between the DL repair group and the DL non-repair group. Conclusions In this meta-analysis of comparative studies, DL repair offered great advantages in terms of the post-operative MCS, final MCS, AOFAS score and rate of complications compared with non-repair. The repair of the DL in patients with acute ankle fractures might be beneficial to ankle joint stability and assist in improving the quality of ankle reduction. More high-quality and prospective studies with long follow-up durations are needed to further demonstrate the superiority of DL repair over non-repair."

Several injury prevention programs have been confirmed to reduce the number of injuries in female and male players. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data about their cost, burden, and benefit for the health care system. In this paper we aim to systematically review the literature and critically evaluate the economic quality of injury prevention interventions implemented across different populations of soccer players. Web of Science, Medline, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, and other databases were searched from January 2011 through July 2021. Research articles were only selected for analysis if they focused on the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention, were experimental papers written in English, and were published following the peer-review process. Three cluster RCT and one retrospective study met the criteria. Cost data on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. The included studies had a good/average quality of economic evaluation. Based on ICERs, injury prevention interventions were cost-effective in three out of the three comparisons. One study did not report the ICER value. However, since economic analyses were reported with varying methodological approaches and results, more data are required to recognize the cost-effectiveness of soccer-specific injury prevention interventions and their benefit for the health care system."

https://openalex.org/W3211977883,Potential Relevance of Bioactive Peptides in Sports Nutrition,2021-11-10,2021,review,"Bioactive peptides are physiologically active peptides mostly derived from proteins following gastrointestinal digestion, fermentation or hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes. It has been shown that bioactive peptides can be resorbed in their intact form and have repeatedly been shown to have a positive effect on health-related parameters such as hypertension, dyslipoproteinemia, inflammation and oxidative stress. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that biologically active peptides could also play an important role in sports nutrition. Current studies have shown that bioactive peptides could have a positive impact on changes in body composition and muscular performance, reduce muscle damage following exercise and induce beneficial adaptions within the connective tissue. In the following overview, potential mechanisms as well as possible limitations regarding the sports-related effect of bioactive peptides and their potential mechanisms are presented and discussed. In addition, practical applications will be discussed on how bioactive peptides can be integrated into a nutritional approach in sports to enhance athletic performance as well as prevent injuries and improve the rehabilitation process."

Additionally, the capacity of SSGs to recreate the official match demands was investigated.Twenty-five elite football players were monitored. Total distance (TD), high-speed running, very high-speed running, sprint and accelerations plus decelerations distance were measured during 20 SSGs formats and 25 official-matches; in SSGs, average heart rate was also collected. During submaximal Yo-Yo test, heart rate at peak exercise, heart rate post-60s recovery and rate of perceived exertion were collected. Coefficient of variation, interclass correlation-coefficient and correlation-coefficient analysis were used to calculate validity, reliability, construct validity and, internal and external responsiveness of SSGs demands.In SSGs, a small variability (~6.0%) with moderate reliability (~0.542 to ~0.663) was found in TD and heart rate, while a high variability (~20.8% to ~60.3%) with poor to moderate reliability (~0.358 to ~0.605) was observed in the other metrics; in submaximal Yo-Yo, heart rate showed small variability (~3.7%) with good reliability (~0.933 to ~0.916). The SSGs demands showed poor internal and external responsiveness (P>0.05) to the training-induced aerobic adaptations as assessed by submaximal Yo-Yo. The construct validity of SSGs showed overall large to very large correlations (r=0.53 to 0.90, P<0.05) between SSGs and official match demands across the season.SSGs should not replace standardized field tests to detect the training-induced aerobic adaptations. However, SSGs could be confidently used to recreate specific contextual factors in elite football players."

https://openalex.org/W3213247023,Which assessments are used to analyze neuromuscular control by electromyography after an anterior cruciate ligament injury to determine readiness to return to sports? A systematic review,2021-11-08,2021,review,"Abstract Background Adequate neuromuscular control of the knee could be one element to prevent secondary injuries after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. To assess neuromuscular control in terms of time, amplitude and activity, electromyography (EMG) is used. However, it is unclear which assessments using EMG could be used for a safe return to sports (RTS). Therefore, we aimed to summarize EMG-related assessments for neuromuscular control of the knee in adult patients after an ACL injury to decide upon readiness for RTS. Methods This systematic review followed guidelines of Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane recommendations. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), SPORTDiscus and the Web of Science were searched from inception to March 2019 and updated in November 2020. Studies identifying electromyographic assessments for neuromuscular control during dynamic tasks in adult, physically active patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury were eligible and qualitatively synthesized. Two independent reviewers used a modified Downs and Black checklist to assess risk of bias of included studies. Results From initially 1388 hits, 38 mainly cross-sectional, case-controlled studies were included for qualitative analysis. Most studies provided EMG outcomes of thigh muscles during jumping, running or squatting. Outcomes measures described neuromuscular control of the knee in domains of time, amplitude or activity. Risk of bias was medium to high due to an unclear description of participants and prior interventions, confounding factors and incompletely reported results. Conclusions Despite a wide range of EMG outcome measures for neuromuscular control, none was used to decide upon return to sports in these patients. Additional studies are needed to define readiness towards RTS by assessing neuromuscular control in adult ACL patients with EMG. Further research should aim at finding reliable and valid, EMG-related variables to be used as diagnostic tool for neuromuscular control. Moreover, future studies should aim at more homogenous groups including adequately matched healthy subjects, evaluate gender separately and use sport-specific tasks. Registration The protocol for this systematic review was indexed beforehand in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and registered as CRD42019122188."

Thirty-three participants were randomly allocated to PT group (n = 11), PJT group (n = 11), and an active control group (CG; n = 11). Before and after 12 weeks of training, tests were performed for the assessment of sprint-speed , change-of-direction (CoD) speed, muscular strength , and aerobic-endurance (AE). Findings indicated significant group×time interaction effects for all sprint-speed intervals, CoD speed, AE, and strength (d = 0.20–0.32). Post-hoc analyses revealed significant, moderate-to-large improvements in all sprint-speed intervals, CoD speed, AE, and muscle strength following PT (ES = 0.71 to 1.38). The PJT induced significant, moderate-to-large enhancements in 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m sprint, CoD speed, and AE (ES = 0.51 to 0.96) with no significant changes for 5 m sprint-speed and muscle strength (ES = 0.71 and 0.16, respectively). No significant pre-post changes were observed for the CG . Overall, PT and PJT are effective means to improve various measures of physical fitness in prepubertal male soccer players. Notably, to additionally improve acceleration and muscle strength, PT has an advantage over PJT."

Weight bearing dorsiflexion range can be an effecting factor in ankle injuries. Weight bearing lunge test is used to assess weight bearing dorsiflexion. By using this test as a standard testing protocol, it is possible to minimize development of further sport related ankle injuries. But this test for basketball players with ankle injuries has not been studied yet. The current study will aim to examine the weight bearing dorsiflexion of basketball players related to their gender, ankle injury history and leg dominance. A quasi-experimental design study was conducted. Thirty-four (34) participants were recruited and initially and two (2) were excluded. 18 participants were male and 14 were female basketball players in Colombo Blues and Kotelawala Defence University basketball teams. The average of age of the sample was 21.8 years. Demographic data, information about training time, injury history of the participants was obtained using an interview administered assessment form. The Weight Bearing Dorsiflexion was measured using digital inclinometer. Findings indicated that the weight bearing dorsiflexion range is smaller than that of males (p&gt;0.05). There was a significant difference in weight bearing dorsiflexion and ankle injury history (p&lt;0.01) among players. Significant differences were seen in influence in leg dominance to weight bearing dorsiflexion (p&lt;0.05). This is the first study that is investigated weight bearing dorsiflexion among basketball players in Sri Lanka. No significant difference was found between gender and weight bearing dorsiflexion. A significant difference was determined between ankle injury history and weight bearing dorsiflexion.

https://openalex.org/W3208255719,The role of player mass and contact speed on head kinematics and neck dynamics in rugby union tackling,2021-11-05,2021,article,"Tackling is the most common cause of general injuries in rugby union, with player speed and mass identified as risk factors. This study aimed to use multibody modeling simulations to examine how tackler and ball carrier mass and contact speed affect inertial head kinematics and neck dynamics. Simulations were run by independently varying the ball carrier and tackler mass (from 60 to 110kg) and speed (from 0 to 10 m/s). Peak resultant inertial neck dynamics (force and moment) and head kinematics (linear acceleration, angular acceleration, and angular velocity) were extracted from each simulation. The greatest inertial head kinematics and neck dynamics sustained by a player was when there was the greatest mass disparity in the tackle, with the lighter player experiencing greatest inertial neck dynamics and head kinematics by up to 24% in comparison with the scenario when both players were the lightest mass (60 kg). As a player's mass increased, the magnitude of their head kinematics and neck dynamics diminished, but increased for their direct opponent, irrespective of whether they were the tackler or ball carrier. For speed, the greatest inertial head kinematics and neck dynamics sustained by the ball carrier and tackler were when they were both traveling at the highest speed. In theory, large discrepancies in mass of players, and high speeds into a tackle should be avoided."

The aim of the present study was to view whether anthropometric parameters including height, weight, BMI and thigh circumference have any bearing on the size of hamstring tendon grafts used in anterior cruciate ligament replacement.&#x0D; Methods: Pre-operative anthropometric measurements were taken on 72 patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction, including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, and thigh circumference. The Person correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation of these anthropometric variables and simple logistic regression was used to evaluate the correlation of these anthropometric variables on the size of the graft that was acquired.&#x0D; Results: Gracilis tendon [GT] length correlates with height (r 1/4 0,432), and semitendinosus [ST] length correlates with thigh circumference (r 1/4 0,255). Women's graft diameter (7.16 ± 0.82 mm) smaller than that of men (7.39 ± 0.63 mm) (p &gt; 0.05), although not statistically significant. The diameter of the autograft was shown to be strongly linked with parameters.&#x0D; Conclusion: As a consequence, our findings suggest that anthropometric measures can be used in the preoperative planning and prediction of hamstring graft length and diameter in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction."

Despite the high rate of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) following these injuries, the contributing factors remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the immune cell profiles of normal and injured joints at the time of ACL and meniscal surgeries. Methods Twenty-nine patients (14 meniscus-injured and 15 ACL-injured) undergoing ACL and/or meniscus surgery but with a normal contralateral knee were recruited. During surgery, synovial fluid was aspirated from both normal and injured knees. Synovial fluid cells were pelleted, washed, and stained with an antibody cocktail consisting of fluorescent antibodies for cell surface proteins. Analysis of immune cells in the synovial fluid was performed by polychromatic flow cytometry. A broad spectrum immune cell panel was used in the first 10 subjects. Based on these results, a T cell-specific panel was used in the subsequent 19 subjects. Results Using the broad spectrum immune cell panel, we detected significantly more total viable cells and CD3 T cells in the injured compared to the paired normal knees. In addition, there were significantly more injured knees with T cells above a 500-cell threshold. Within the injured knees, CD4 and CD8 T cells were able to be differentiated into subsets. The frequency of total CD4 T cells was significantly different among injury types, but no statistical differences were detected among CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets by injury type. Conclusions Our findings provide foundational data showing that ACL and meniscus injuries induce an immune cell-rich microenvironment that consists primarily of T cells with multiple T helper phenotypes. Future studies investigating the relationship between immune cells and joint degeneration may provide an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of PTOA following joint injury."

Research in this area reveals the accuracy of these decisions is questionable in even the most elite sport environments and athletes are increasingly disputing these decisions as unfair and punitive. As a countermeasure to these dispute and arbitration practices, many elite sport systems have created policies where coaches must outline and stand behind the criteria used for their selection decisions. Selection criteria policies have the potential to help encourage fair selection practices by holding selectors accountable to their selection criteria, but their implementation also has the potential to wrongfully nudge selectors toward developing more defendable, but less-accurate selection practices. The paper concludes with 10 suggestions to help support practitioners when implementing selection criteria."

It is thus critical to design appropriate intervention strategies for training workers to improve their posture, reducing load on the spine during lifting. The main approach to train safe lifting to workers has been educational; however, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that this approach does not improve lifting movement nor reduces the risk of low back injury. One of the main limitations of this approach lies in the amount, quality and context of practice of the lifting movement. In this article, first we argue for integrating psychologically-grounded perspectives of practice design in the development of training interventions for safe lifting. Principles from deliberate practice and motor learning are combined and integrated. Given the complexity of lifting, a training intervention should occur in the workplace and invite workers to repeatedly practice/perform the lifting movement with the clear goal of improving their lifting-related body posture. Augmented feedback has a central role in creating the suitable condition for achieving such intervention. Second, we focus on spine bending as risk factor and present a pilot study examining the benefits and boundary conditions of different feedback modalities for reducing bending during lifting. The results showed how feedback modalities meet differently key requirements of deliberate practice conditions, i.e., feedback has to be informative, individualized and actionable. Following the proposed approach, psychology will gain an active role in the development of training interventions, contributing to finding solutions for a reduction of risk factors for workers."

There are numerous factors that contribute to recurrent patellofemoral instability; these factors include tear of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), weakening or hypoplasia of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), trochlear dysplasia, increased tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance (&gt;20 mm), valgus malalignment, increased Q angle, malrotation secondary to internal femoral or external tibial torsion, patella alta, and generalized ligamentous laxity. A detailed history and a thorough physical examination are crucial to clinch an early, accurate diagnosis. Imaging studies play an important role to confirm the clinical diagnosis and also help to identify concomitant intra-articular pathologies. Initially, nonoperative management (including the use of physical therapy, patellar taping or brace) is offered to patients with acute, first-time patellar dislocations and most patients respond well to this mode of treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated for patients who have post-trauma osteochondral fracture or loose body; predisposing anatomical risk factors; recurrent, symptomatic instability; and who have failed an adequate trial of nonoperative management. Surgical treatments include MPFL reconstruction, proximal or distal realignment procedures, and trochleoplasty. Lateral release is often performed in combination with other procedures and seldom performed as an isolated procedure. An individualized case-by-case approach is recommended based on the underlying anatomical risk factors and radiographic abnormality."

Participants performed a bilateral DVJ using VMocap, and the knee valgus angle (KVA), knee flexion angle (KFA), hip flexion angle (HFA), and lower leg anterior inclination angle (LAIA) were calculated from the motion capture data. These joint angles and inclination angles were evaluated at the time of highest point of the first jump (H1), initial contact (IC), maximum knee flexion (MKF), toe-off (TO), and highest point of the second jump (H2). The unpaired t test was used to compare sex-based differences.At H1, the KVA in females showed more valgus (-2.9° vs -5.4°) and the LAIA in females was greater (29.1° vs 25.7°) versus males (P < .01 for both). At IC, the KVA in females showed more valgus (-1.3° vs -3.0°) and females had a greater KFA (20.8° vs 14.3°) and LAIA (5.1° vs 0.0°) compared with males (P < .01 for all). At MKF, female KVA showed more valgus (6.2° vs -9.5°), and females had greater LAIA (36.6° vs 34.6°), smaller KFA (77.5° vs 87.5°), and smaller HFA (55.8° vs 82.0°) compared with males (P < .01 for all). At TO, female KVA showed more valgus (-0.7° vs -3.1°) and female KFA, HFA, and LAIA were greater (31.7° vs 19.2°; 19.9° vs 16.4°; and 18.2° vs 11.5°, respectively) than males (P < .01 for all). At H2, females had a greater KFA (18.6° vs 14.6°) and LAIA (13.3° vs 9.9°) than males (P < .04 for both).Asian female soccer players showed increased KVA and LAIA, decreased KFA and HFA at MKF, and increased KFA at IC and TO compared with their male counterparts in this analysis of the DVJ.Elucidation of kinematic differences between the sexes can aid in predicting injuries."

It is unknown whether players who heavily rely on driving have decreased performance on returning to play after ACL reconstruction (ACLR).Players with a greater tendency to drive to the basket would be more likely to tear their ACL versus noninjured controls and would experience decreased performance when returning to play after ACLR.Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.Season-level performance statistics and ACL injuries were aggregated for National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons between 1980 and 2017 from publicly available sources. Players' tendency to drive was calculated using 49 common season-level performance metrics. Each ACL-injured player was matched with 2 noninjured control players by age, league experience, and style of play metrics. Points, playing minutes, driving, and 3-point shooting tendencies were compared between players with ACL injuries and matched controls. Independent-samples t test was utilized for comparisons.Of 86 players with a total of 96 ACL tears identified in the NBA, 50 players were included in the final analysis. Players who experienced an ACL tear had a higher career-average drive tendency than controls (P = .047). Players with career-average drive tendency ≥1 standard deviation above the mean were more likely to tear their ACL than players with drive tendency <1 standard deviation (5.2% vs 2.7%; P = .026). There was no significant difference in total postinjury career points (P = .164) or career minutes (P = .237) between cases and controls. There was also no significant change in drive tendency (P = .152) or 3-point shooting tendency (P = .508) after return to sport compared with controls.NBA players with increased drive tendency were more likely to tear their ACL. However, players who were able to return after ACLR did not underperform compared with controls and did not alter their style of play compared with the normal changes seen with age. This information can be used to target players with certain playing styles for ACL injury prevention programs."

https://openalex.org/W3210926472,Evidence-Based Treatment and Outcomes of Tibial Bone Stress Injuries,2021-11-01,2021,article,"Bone stress injury (BSI) of the tibia, a spectrum of impairments that include conditions commonly referred to as medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), tibial stress reaction, and tibial stress fracture, is relatively common in athletes of various ages and levels of competition. While simple rest from the offending activities remains the primary method of treatment, identification of nutritional, hormonal, and biomechanical risk factors is crucial to prevent persistent or recurrent injury. Perhaps the most basic and important mechanical risk factor, especially in those with chronic or recurrent injury, may be abnormalities in gait and ankle flexibility, which can range from subtle to severe. While magnetic resonance imaging-based (MRI) injury grading can provide a framework for expected healing time, treatment must be individualized and evolution of a patient’s symptoms should guide the progression to return to sport after a prescribed period of rest. The vast majority of tibial BSIs can be managed nonoperatively and surgery is largely reserved for those who have undergone exhaustive conservative management without success, those with multiple recurrences, or high-level competitive athletes with the most severe grades of injury. The current review aims to highlight current concepts in the treatment of tibial BSI, with a particular focus on the high-risk population of adolescent athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3215497113,209 Performance of inertial measurement units to classify different upper limb activities in elite women’s water polo: a cross sectional study,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Water polo had the highest injury incidence of all team sports at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Injuries have been linked to external load in training and competition (Mountjoy <i>et al</i>, 2015, Wheeler <i>et al</i>, 2013). External load monitoring is likely instructive in managing loads to optimise performance while minimising injury risk. Inertial measurement units and machine learning techniques have shown promise in other sports in monitory external load. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the performance of a decision tree model using peak resultant acceleration (RAcc<sup>PEAK</sup>)and angular velocity (AngVel<sup>PEAK</sup>) variables during water polo activities - high intensity throwing (HIT), low intensity throwing (LIT), blocking with ball contact (BWBC) and swimming (SWIM) compared to video analysis. <h3>Design</h3> A cross-sectional study <h3>Setting</h3> A sports institute pool. <h3>Participants</h3> We recruited ten elite female water polo players – 21.2 (SD 4.8) years old, 8.7 (SD 4.6) training years. <h3>Interventions</h3> Two Blue Trident<sup>TM</sup> inertial measurement units were applied to each athlete to collect kinetic variables during a standardised baseline test. Each test was recorded using a digital video recorder and coded for activity verification. R-Studio was used to analyse the data and calculate the predicted volume of each activity compared to the coded video verification. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> RAcc<sup>PEAK</sup> and AngVel<sup>PEAK</sup> values in abovementioned activities and model accuracy. <h3>Results</h3> Each of the activities showed distinct bandwidths of RAcc<sup>PEAK</sup> and AngVel<sup>PEAK</sup>. The model recorded the following activity volume (N) with 6 false positive errors with a 96% accuracy – HIT (32) LIT (34), BWBC (22) and SWIM (70). <h3>Conclusions</h3> This method shows potential to identify different upper limb activities in water polo. These activities most likely load the upper limb differentially and would be critical to measure in monitoring external training load. External load measurement may assist in optimising training planning."

Presently, no such data exist for professional football players competing in the Middle East. <h3>Objective</h3> To describe the mechanisms of ACL injury in male professional football players in the Qatar Star League (QSL) based on systematic video analysis. <h3>Design</h3> Systematic video analysis of prospective injury surveillance data. <h3>Setting</h3> Male professional football in Qatar. <h3>Participants</h3> Fifteen professional male football players in the QSL, who sustained an ACL injury in a match during the seasons 2013/2014 through 2018/2019. <h3>Assessment of injury mechanisms</h3> Injuries were recorded through the Aspetar Injury Surveillance Programme and high definition broadcast videos were analyzed (49 views; 34 slow motion). Five analysts independently described the injury mechanisms in detail (situation, behavior, biomechanical characteristics), using validated observational tools (Walden et al. 2015). <h3>Results</h3> A knee valgus mechanism was observed in 10 cases (1 with direct contact to the knee, 3 with contact to other body part and 6 with no body contact), no valgus was observed in 2 cases (both direct knee contact), while 3 were unclear. Of the 12 non-contact/indirect-contact situations, we saw 4 main categories of injury situations (multiple combinations were possible): pressing (n=6), tackling or to be tackled by another player (n=4), blocking (n=3) and screening (n=2). In the 3 direct contact injuries, the player was tackling in 2 cases and being tackled by another player in 1 case. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Only 20% of match ACL injuries were contact injuries. Knee valgus was consistently observed, independent of the playing situation. Pressing was the main mechanism leading to injury. Landing after heading was not observed in any of these injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3217620728,310 The effect of a 90-min soccer match and fatigue on eccentric hamstring strength: implications for hamstring injury risk,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Hamstring injury (HI) is the most prevalent muscle injury in both amateur (van Beijsterveldt et al., 2015) and professional (Ekstrand et al., 2011; Hawkins et al., 2001) soccer (football) players. Worryingly, the annual incidence of HI increased by 2.4% annually between 2010 and 2014 (Ekstrand et al., 2016) <h3>Setting</h3> Professional football. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Twenty-two semi-professional football players (Mean ± SD: Age: 19.3 ± 2.9 year; Height 185.0 ± 8.7 cm; Body Mass 81.6 ± 6.7 kg) participated in this study. <h3>Design</h3> All players were right dominant (defined as their preferred 'kicking' leg). Subjects were included in the study if they were not injured or rehabilitating from an injury at the time of testing. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> The eccentric hamstring strength of players was examined using the Nordbord (Vald Performance, Queensland, Australia) device prior to soccer match and immediately following 90 minutes of football friendly match.The season period of the research project was the second half of the season. <h3>Results</h3> There was a significant difference of moderate effect in eccentric strength before a match (M = 306.91, SD = 59.26) compared and to after the match (mean = 277.77 ± SD = 60.35 p =.000, Cohen's d = .50) (table 1). The eccentric force before training (mean = 306.91 ±SD = 59.26) and after training (M = 277.77, SD = 60.35 demonstrated a significant moderate effect(p =.000, Cohen's d = .50). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Etiological risk factors attributed to an increased risk of muscular injury include poor muscular strength, particularly eccentric strength deficits, and ipsilateral muscular strength imbalances. Resistance to fatigue and eccentric strength, particularly at high speeds should be given greater consideration in conditioning for soccer. The small number of participants limits the global generalization of our findings. However, this limitation is tempered by the inclusion of professional players in our study."

Totally, 461 potential references recorded through Endnote and imported. Out of the 117 potential titles and abstracts screened by two independent researchers through Covidence, 54 full-text assessed for eligibility of which, 28 were included. Quality of studies and risk of bias were then assessed. <h3>Results</h3> Studies carried out in 4 continents and 14 countries while recruiting female and male players aging range from 9 to 30. These indicate that the 11+ has been investigated worldwide. Quality of studies was moderate to high and except an unclear amount of bias for blinding outcome assessment; risk of bias for all domains was low. Excepting lower extremity stability, ankle evertors time latency and proprioception improvement, application of the 11+ at long-term (a complete football season) appeared to be successful in improving a variety of performance tests e.g. agility, sprinting, balance, jumping, cutting maneuvers etc; physiological responses and a majority of biomechanical measures. Vice versa, that the 11+ causes acute negative impact on the physical performance and technical abilities compared to the dynamic warm ups was highlighted in two studies. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Application of the 11+ as warm up routine during trainings at long-term with higher adherence can be recommended for improving performance. However, caution must be observed while recruiting the 11+ for warming up before competitions as it may acutely decrease physical performance and technical abilities. Given the contradictory nature of the literature, further studies should evaluate short-term effects of the programme."

A control group of 20 uninjured athletes, matched for gender and type of sport, was included. <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> All participants performed a stepping-down task under 4 conditions: 1. no additional challenges (NORM), 2. whilst performing a cognitive dual-task (DUAL), 3. whilst undergoing unpredictable surface perturbations (PERT), 4. whilst performing a cognitive dual-task + undergoing unpredictable surface perturbations. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Muscle activations of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis, hamstrings medialis (HM), hamstrings lateralis were recorded with surface EMG. Integrals were calculated over the landing period (50–250 ms after initial contact) and normalized to maximal voluntary contractions. <h3>Results</h3> The ACLR athletes showed an almost unadjusted strategy of increased HM (6.7% (ACL); 3.9% (control), F=5.07, p=0.031) and decreased VM activation across all tasks (6.8% (ACL); 12.9% (control), F=8.52, p=0.006 ), whilst the control group had a clear increase in HM activation (3.2% (NORM); 5.6% (PERT), t=4.06, p=0.001) and VM activation (9.0% (NORM);16.9% (PERT), t=3.81, p=0.001) when unpredictable perturbations occurred. However, within the ACLR athletes HM activation decreased when a dual task was added (7.3% (NORM); 4.7% (DUAL), t=3.4, p=0.003). <h3>Conclusions</h3> It seems that the neuromuscular strategy of the ACLR athlete is an overprotective strategy to improve knee stability. They use this strategy in every situation, potentially to compensate for the altered proprioceptive input. This overprotective strategy is jeopardized under cognitively challenging circumstances, confirming that underlying neurocognitive limitations contribute to altered neuromuscular control in ACLR athletes."

A proper assessment is crucial to understand injury risk and which factors we should modify to prevent it. <h3>Objective</h3> To identify the contribution of lower limb strength, range of motion (ROM), alignment and functional stability on lower limb muscle strain in elite volleyball athletes. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> One volleyball team facility. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Twenty-five male elite volleyball athletes. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> All data were collected before the beginning of the competitive season. Athletes were aleatory selected in some stations with physiotherapists previously trained to apply the following tests: Shank-forefoot alignment, passive hip internal rotation ROM, Y-Test, hip extensors strength, knee flexors and extensors strength. Injuries were collected from the historic of past seasons. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Injuries were considered when the athlete had any muscle complaint and stayed absent from the sport for at least one training or match sessions. <h3>Results</h3> 9 muscle strains were found, which represents 41% of all injuries on the team. The regression model revealed that hip extensor strength was associated with muscle strain in elite volleyball athletes (F= 8.050; r = 0.518; R<sup>2</sup>= 0.235; p= 0.010). Specifically, weakness of hip extensors increases the chance of lower limb muscle strain in elite volleyball athletes (B= -0.250). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hip extensor weakness explains 23% of lower limb muscle strains in elite volleyball athletes. Prevention programs should include hip extensor strengthening to decrease the chance of lower limb muscle strain in elite volleyball athletes."

We hypothesized pitchers with high BF% would display increased kinetics and higher rates of injury and pain. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional; retrospective. <h3>Setting</h3> Indoor biomechanics laboratory with high-school league softball pitchers. <h3>Participants</h3> Forty-three female pitchers volunteered (1.69±.07 m, 75.97±16.85 kg, 15.2±1.2 years) and were analyzed. Participants were currently on team rosters and surgery/injury free for the last six months. <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> BF% was determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and pitchers were grouped into healthy (&lt;32 BF%; n=17) and high-fat (≥32 BF%; n=26) categories. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Throwing shoulder distraction, superior, lateral, and anterior forces (normalized to body weight * pitch velocity) were measured via an electromagnetic motion capture system. History of softball related injuries and the presence of pain was self-reported on a health history questionnaire. <h3>Results</h3> 83.3% of pitchers currently experiencing pain (total n=12) and 72.2% of pitchers who had suffered a softball-related injury (total n=18) were high-fat pitchers. Statistical parametric mapping was used to determine differences in throwing shoulder forces between groups during foot contact to follow-through of the pitch. Analyses revealed high-fat pitchers had higher normalized distraction force over most of the first 27% of the pitch (t<sub>crit</sub>=3.112, p&lt;.008) and lower normalized superior force during 80–91% of the pitch (t<sub>crit</sub>=3.141, p=.004). <h3>Conclusions</h3> High BF% alters shoulder kinetics during the pitch and may increase high-school softball pitchers' injury risk. Athletes, coaches, and clinicians should understand this increased risk and safely emphasize the importance of attaining a healthy body composition."

This has been investigated in professional rugby but not in the UK elite level pathway. <h3>Objective</h3> Describe the incidence of concussion and characteristics of tackles resulting in concussion in British University rugby union. <h3>Design</h3> A one-season prospective cohort study; team medical staff reported match play concussions. Matches were filmed and tackle-related concussions were analysed alongside 796 non-injurious 'control' tackles. <h3>Setting</h3> British University and Colleges (BUCS) 'Super' rugby union: season 2018/19. <h3>Participants</h3> Eight teams (341 players). <h3>Independent variables</h3> Match exposure. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Injury incidence and characteristics of tackles associated with concussion. <h3>Results</h3> There were 43 concussions in 154 team games; incidence was 14.0 per 1000 player match hours (95% CI: 10.1–18.8) and mean absence was 23 days (95% CI: 16.1–29.9). Thirty-four (79%) concussions occurred in the tackle; 22 by the tackler and 12 by the ball carrier. Twenty-five tackles resulting in concussion could be conclusively identified on video (tackler: 16; ball carrier: 9). For control tackles, 5% resulted in initial impact to the head/neck and 18% to the shoulders of the ball carrier compared with tackles resulting in concussions to the ball carrier [head/neck, 3 (33%); shoulder, 2 (22%)] or tackler [head/neck, 2 (13%); shoulder, 3 (19%)]. For tackler concussions, 3 (19%) involved head-to-head contact (2% of control tackles) and 4 (25%) involved head-to-shoulder contacts (6% of control). The ball carrier was travelling at high speed for 67% of ball carrier concussions, compared with 29% for control tackles. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Concussion incidence in high-level university rugby union is slightly lower than professional rugby with most concussions occurring in the tackle. Lowering tackle height may help reduce concussion for the ball carrier and the tackler should prioritise head positioning away from the ball carrier's head and shoulders."

Participants completed two trials of each exercise and were judged on maintaining neutral body alignment after receiving visual/verbal instruction on the first trial and feedback cues on the second trial. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Three evaluators judged each exercise, which was deemed as correct when at least two evaluators agreed that neutral alignment was maintained. Comparisons were made across ages and between sex using the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. The proportions of participants who performed the exercise correctly were also compared before and after feedback cues were provided. <h3>Results</h3> There were no significant differences in performance across ages and sex for nearly all exercises. Most neuromuscular training exercises had a less than 50% success rate for proper neutral alignment in children 8–17 years of age. The use of visual and verbal feedback cues significantly increased the proportion of participants who correctly completed the exercise (p&lt;0.001). Inter-rater reliability among the evaluators ranged from kappa=0.31 to 0.42, showing fair to moderate agreement. <h3>Conclusions</h3> These results demonstrate the importance of training coaches and physical education teachers to provide cues that reinforce proper technique during ACL injury prevention exercises. Children should perform common neuromuscular training exercises with feedback on proper technique. The availability of age-appropriate exercises may help increase adherence to injury prevention programs and maximize their effect on reducing injuries."

These injuries have serious long-term consequences and cause substantial socio-economic costs. The preventive effect of an exercise program is highly dependent on its components and the level of compliance. In Belgium, it is unknown whether non-elite soccer teams implement neuromuscular training to prevent ACL injuries. <h3>Objective</h3> Is preventive neuromuscular training incorporated during practice in non-elite Belgian soccer? <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Non-elite soccer teams. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Twelve hundred and five athletes (86 teams) and 799 female athletes (78 teams), aged between 18 and 35, participated to this study. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Survey data of athletes were collected twice during the season 2014–2015 (male athletes) and season 2015–2016 (female athletes). <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Using an online survey (www.letselpreventie.be), information concerning type, duration and frequency of implemented exercises or barriers to neuromuscular training during the preseason and season were gathered. <h3>Results</h3> During the preseason, only 12% of the athletes indicated to perform balance exercises (jump-landing) and plyometric exercises with a frequency of two sessions per week and a duration of at least 10 minutes per exercise. During the season, this percentage was reduced to 4%. Fifty-five to 77% (preseason) and 65 to 82% (season) of the athletes respectively indicate not to perform any neuromuscular training at all. Most important barriers to neuromuscular training were: 'I don't need it', 'I have no time', 'stretching and warming-up are sufficient' and 'I don't know which exercises to perform'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Most non-elite soccer teams do not implement neuromuscular training for preventing ACL injuries. These results highlight the need for educating coaches and athletes to implement neuromuscular training during practice."

Identifying the factors that lead to failed landings may provide specific targets for injury prevention programs. <h3>Objective</h3> Identify which neuromuscular and biomechanical variables predict success or failure during unanticipated drop-jump landings. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Controlled laboratory setting. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Thirty-two healthy male (n=16; 15.9±1.87 yrs.) and female (15.7±1.7 yrs.) Ottawa area competitive athletes with no history of major musculoskeletal injury affecting functional performance. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Participants completed single-leg drop-jump landings from a platform aligned to their tibial plateau. The landing leg was randomly signalled during flight via a projector in front of the participant. The landings were then categorized as 'successful' or 'failed' (defined as any loss of balance forcing the participant to adjust their base of support during landing). <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Sex, limb dominance, joint angles and excursions, and muscle excitation amplitudes during the flight phase of the drop-jumps were extracted. These variables were normalized, reduced and submitted to a logistic regression. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-nine variables were reduced to a seven variable logistic regression model that included trunk and pelvis lateral tilt, pelvis internal rotation, hip abduction, trunk and pelvis joint excursion, and biceps femoris muscle excitation. Using these variable the model correctly classified 74% of the landings. The same variables are present for both males and females. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Regardless of sex, an athlete who presents the identified movement and control patterns during the flight phase risks a failed landing, potentially increasing the risk of injury. Typical prophylactic interventions focus on landing characteristics. This research indicates for the first time that modifying what occurs prior to landing is critical and must be addressed through training."

Little is known if maturational changes in cutting technique contribute to the increased injury risk. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine longitudinal changes in cutting kinematics in female athletes as they matured through puberty. <h3>Design</h3> Longitudinal cohort study <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanics laboratory <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> One-hundred and seventy-two healthy high-school athletes were tested while in at least two different pubertal stages (pre-, mid-, post-pubertal). <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Trunk, hip, and knee sagittal, frontal and transverse plane range-of-motion, peak angles, and angles at initial-contact during an unanticipated 45° cut measured with a laboratory-based optoelectronic motion capture system. Pubertal stages were defined by Tanner Stages. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Changes in trunk, hip, and knee kinematics as girls mature across puberty (pre-to-midpubertal, pre-to-postpubertal, mid-to-postpubertal). <h3>Results</h3> As girls matured through puberty, they displayed a decrease in sagittal-plane hip (1.6–4.4°, p≤0.01) and knee range-of-motion (ROM) (2.7–2.9°, p≤0.01), and decreased peak hip (2.9–3.2°, p≤0.02) and knee flexion angles (2.5–2.9°, p≤0.01), which is indicative of greater quadriceps dominance. Peak knee abduction angles also increased as girls progressed through puberty (0.9–1.4°, p≤0.006), suggesting greater ligament dominance. In terms of trunk dominance, there were mixed findings with a decrease in trunk frontal- (2.5–5.7°, p&lt;0.01) and sagittal-plane ROM (1.4–2.0°, p≤0.05), but an increase in trunk transverse-plane ROM (2.8–3.6°, p≤0.01) observed as girls mature. Other significant changes in cutting technique were decreased peak trunk flexion (3.8–7.8°, p≤0.01), and decreased hip flexion (2.9–3.3°, p≤0.01) and knee flexion angles (2.0–3.0°, p≤0.02) at initial contact, suggesting a more upright and stiffer cutting posture. <h3>Conclusions</h3> As girls mature through puberty, they display a change in cutting strategy characterized by greater quadriceps and ligament dominance. Ameliorating these kinematic changes throughout maturation may further reduce ACL injuries in this high-risk group."

Some sports involve a high risk of orofacial trauma, particularly contact sports. Undoubtedly, mouthguards are considered by many as an effective solution in preventing injury. <h3>Objective</h3> This systematic review aimed to measure the effectiveness of mouthguards in preventing oral-facial injuries. <h3>Design</h3> Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) <h3>Setting</h3> Available electronic databases <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Contact sport athletes <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases searches were supplemented by manual searching, of in-vivo studies examining prevention of orofacial injuries by protective devices that cover the teeth and surrounding soft tissues (mouthguards). <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Included studies were assessed for methodological quality and bias. A meta-analysis was performed on data from selected studies, comparing the number of injuries for mouthguard users and non-users. Results are presented as forest plots and relative risks between different studies compared. <h3>Results</h3> 1745 records were identified. Fifteen studies were eligible for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis, seven were included in the meta-analysis. The overall quality of studies was low, primarily due to a high degree of bias. The degree of heterogeneity was high throughout the studies affecting most of the variables such as sport, athletes' age, the definition of injury used and type of mouthguard. The meta-analysis showed that wearing a mouthguard was associated with a greater risk of orofacial injury when compared to non-users (overall RR 0.85%, 95% CI 0.78–0.93). However, the high degree of heterogeneity questions the validity of the summary estimate. (I-squared= 91.2%). <h3>Conclusions</h3> There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mouthguards to prevent orofacial injuries. Further research from high quality prospective cohort studies are needed to investigate the protective nature of mouthguards from orofacial injuries, when used in sports. The meta-analysis findings could be explained by athletes being more physical in the knowledge that they are protected."

https://openalex.org/W3216059760,202 Variables associated with knee valgus in male soccer players during a single leg vertical landing task,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Knee valgus during landing and cutting situations has been described as the main biomechanical risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Evidence support the influence of hip strength and biomechanics on knee valgus in female athletes. To develop specific preventive measures for males, it is important to understand biomechanical and musculoskeletal variables associated with this mechanism during activities that mimic ACL injuries. <h3>Objective</h3> To test the correlation between peak knee valgus during a single-leg vertical jump-landing task, and biomechanical and musculoskeletal variables in male soccer professional athletes. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanics laboratory. <h3>Participants</h3> Twenty-four healthy male professional soccer players. <h3>Interventions</h3> Participants performed a vertical jump-landing task during the pre-season. Kinematic data were collected using an 8 high-speed cameras motion analysis system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) with a sample rate of 250 Hz. Maximal isometric hip strength was tested using a hand-held dynamometer and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was measured using a digital inclinometer. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Predictor variables were lateral trunk lean, hip adduction and internal rotation, hip extensors, abductor and external rotator isometric strength, and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. Interest variables were peak knee valgus during the landing task. Association between predictors and interest variables were tested using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (alpha = 0.05). <h3>Results</h3> Lateral trunk lean (r =0.43, p=0.04) and hip internal rotation (r =-0.68, p&lt;0.01) showed significant correlation with peak knee valgus during the vertical landing task. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Trunk position seems to influence the ACL mechanism, possibly by increasing knee abduction moment related to the lateral displacement of centre of mass during lateral trunk lean. The negative correlation between hip internal rotation and knee valgus in males is opposite to the results usually described for females, and may be related to the different influence of hip on ACL injury mechanism between sexes."

However, the relation of aberrant movement patterns and other anthropometrical variables still remains controversial. <h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to analyse if lower limb anthropometrics and knee kinematics could explain landing kinetics during a drop jump maneuver, as primary ACL injury risk factors in a female football environment. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cross-sectional descriptive study. Testing methodology was settled inside an anatomical, biomechanical and functional conditioning risk factor screening. Data collection was made during the pre-season period. <h3>Setting</h3> 4 different teams from the region of the Basque Country (Spain). 2 youth second teams and 2 senior teams competing in the Spanish second division. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> 64 youth female football players (age 20,32±4,9). Every available (non-injured) athlete was included. No lost participants during the data collection. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Pelvic width and femur length were measured as anthropometrical gold variables. Knee valgus kinematics and landing kinetics during the bilateral and unilateral drop jump were registered. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Knee valgus kinematic data (femur-tibia angle &lt;180°) was captured by a video analysis tracker software. Landing kinetics were registered using inertial sensor unit technology. <h3>Results</h3> There was a little correlation (<i>r</i>=0,303) between landing peak VGRF and knee valgus kinematics, at p = 0,01 significance level, and also with the femur length (<i>r</i>=-0,338). In addition, the linear regression analysis showed that the pelvic width, femur length and knee valgus kinematics explained in 89,1% (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>) the landing kinetics results (<i>p</i>=&lt;0,05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> A moderate significance level between lower limb anthropometrics, knee valgus kinematics and landing kinetics was the main finding at the present study. More exhaustive surveillance screening re-tests are needed in order to detect the main contributors for ACL injury mechanics in a female football context."
https://openalex.org/W3216566223,045 Perceived barriers and facilitators towards an injury prevention program among professional male ice hockey players and staff members,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Lower extremity injury prevention programs are effective in team sport athletes. <h3>Objective</h3> This study identifies barriers to and facilitators for an injury prevention program in professional male ice hockey teams among players and staff members. <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional survey. <h3>Setting</h3> Professional male ice hockey teams. <h3>Participants</h3> Eight Swiss National League A (NLA) teams and their staff members were invited to participate in the study and voluntarily completed the questionnaire. Inclusion criteria were the ability to understand German or English and signed informed consent. Six teams completed the questionnaire (148 players and 11 staff members). <h3>Main outcome measurements</h3> Frequency of ratings related to knowledge, attitude, adherence and habits were analysed. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to predict a relationship between players' characteristics and positive attitude towards an injury prevention program. <h3>Results</h3> Knowledge, perceived benefit and relevance of injury prevention as well as awareness of high risk of injuries in ice hockey were identified as important facilitators. Players' habit of exercise performance was identified as a barrier. Program understanding of staff members was identified as a facilitator and barrier. No significant relationships were observed between a high/low perceived benefit of an injury prevention program and age (p = 0.85), nationality (p = 0.53), level of education (p = 0.63), National League experience (p = 0.50) or occurrence of lower extremity injuries in the previous season (p = 0.10). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Identified barriers and facilitators should be addressed when developing and implementing an injury prevention program in a setting of professional ice hockey teams. An injury prevention program should be offered to and implemented in players of all ages, levels of education and experience in National League, irrespective of previous injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3216570993,204 Monitoring movements with high trunk acceleration during badminton games: an approach combining a microsensor unit and video analysis,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Stiff landing is associated with increased anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk, especially in young female athletes. As an alternative to a force platform, a tri-axial accelerometer is a useful tool to reflect the magnitude of the ground reaction force exerted during games. <h3>Objective</h3> To clarify the movements that require high trunk accelerations and their frequency during badminton games. <h3>Design</h3> Observational study. <h3>Setting</h3> Youth athletes, local tournament levels. <h3>Participants</h3> Forty-five female badminton players [17 junior high school (JHS) and 28 high school (HS) athletes]. <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> Movements that generated &gt;4G resultant acceleration were assessed as a risk for ACL injury. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Frequency and characteristics of the movements that generated &gt;4G acceleration during singles games of badminton. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 6,306 movements generated &gt;4G acceleration during an 896-min game duration (7.04 cases/min; 95% confidence interval (CI), 6.87–7.21 cases/min). HS players (7.27 cases/min; 95% CI, 7.05–7.48 cases/min) had a higher incidence of great trunk acceleration compared with JHS players (6.58 cases/min; 95% CI, 6.29–6.87 cases/min). The top three most frequent movements were landing after an overhead stroke (JHS, 1.13 cases/min; HS, 1.58 cases/min), lunging during an under-/side-hand stroke (JHS, 0.98 cases/min; HS, 1.27 cases/min), and cutting from a split stepping (JHS, 0.96 cases/min; HS, 1.29 cases/min). <h3>Conclusions</h3> HS athletes had an opportunity to incur exposure to high-loading movements during badminton games, which supports an epidemiological survey's results that the incidence rate of ACL injury in HS athletes is six times higher than that in JHS athletes. In addition, previously reported mechanisms of ACL injury in badminton (i.e. single-leg landing after an overhead stroke and plant-and-cut manoeuvre after a lunge stepping) were revealed as the high-frequency movements that generated &gt;4G acceleration. This study suggests that video analysis with micro-sensor technology can individually detect the high-loading movements during game-play situations, which contribute to identifying the high-risk athletes from the on-court/field perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3216653468,235 Epidemiology of illness in female athletes: a systematic review,2021-11-01,2021,review,"<h3>Background</h3> Illness prevention within elite sport can confer performance and health benefits to athletes. Despite the growing popularity and coverage of women's sport, little is currently known about the illness profiles of female athletes. <h3>Objective</h3> To describe the incidence and nature of illness in female athletes. <h3>Design</h3> This systematic review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42018092373). CINAL, Medline, PsychINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus were systematically searched from January 2008 to March 2018 inclusively. Peer-reviewed original research articles which reported the incidence and nature of illness in elite female athletes aged 18+ years were included. The risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors using the STROBE Statement Rating Criteria for systematic reviews. The included studies were mapped against the NHMRC evidence hierarchy. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Incidence and nature of acute and chronic illness. <h3>Results</h3> 118 studies met the inclusion criteria; including 65 cohort studies (level ii/iii) and 46 cross-sectional studies (level iv evidence). The mean risk of bias was 16/22 (median=16, range 8–21). Of the included studies, 66 were in elite athletes (including 14 studies in Olympians), and 40 studies investigated collegiate/university athletes. Infections (primarily respiratory and gastrointestinal) were the most frequent cause of illness (46%), followed by mental health issues (20%), regardless of the sport or setting. Heterogeneity of illness definitions, severity classifications, and inconsistencies in exposure measures prevented any direct comparisons of illness incidence/severity across levels of competition. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Illness prevention in women's sport is a novel and emerging research area. Currently there is a lack of consensus on illness data collection, and the majority of studies did not report important methodological information such as participant characteristics, or loss to follow-up. Owing to the lack of good-quality data, the findings are only able to provide a partial overview of the illness profile of female athletes, limiting the development of prevention interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3216655192,047 Soccer players who rupture their ACL demonstrate biomechanical risk factors while decelerating: a prospective cohort study,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Many non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries amongst women's soccer players occur during a deceleration manoeuvre. Retrospective video analysis of ACL injuries has demonstrated that players are often in knee valgus at the time of injury. Whether the components of valgus collapse: hip adduction, hip internal rotation, and knee abduction angles during a deceleration task, differ between players who go on to ACL injury has not been prospectively examined. In order to develop more effective injury prevention programs, it is necessary to understand these risk factors in the context of a sport-specific task. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare whether hip and knee kinematics during a deceleration differ between collegiate women's soccer players who go on to sustain ACL injury and those who don't. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort non-randomized intervention study. <h3>Setting</h3> Collegiate women's soccer. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> 51 collegiate women's soccer players. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Preseason, three-dimensional motion analysis of a deceleration. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Descriptive statistics for injured limbs and the mean of uninjured players' limbs were calculated for peak values of valgus collapse components (hip adduction, hip internal rotation, knee abduction). A MANOVA was also used to determine whether there were biomechanical differences between Injured (N=4) and Uninjured (N=47) players. <h3>Results</h3> There was a significant difference between groups for hip adduction angle (p=0.03). The Injured players were in much more hip adduction (8.63±4.1°) than those who remained Uninjured (1.66±6.0°). There were no other significant or clinically meaningful differences between groups for hip internal rotation or knee abduction angle. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hip adduction during deceleration differed between players who went on to ACL injury and those who did not. Therefore, the components of knee injury prevention programs that address lateral and posterior hip strength and neuromuscular control are likely crucial components of ACL injury prevention programing for soccer players."

Often it comes to training absenteeism because of pain at the proximal edge of the patella. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine if there is a connection between the occurrence of patellofemoral pain and the running style. <h3>Design</h3> Retrospective case-control-study. <h3>Setting</h3> The running analyses all took place in the same 2 D running lab. The selected analyses are of recreational and amateur runners, running at least 10km/week, who were complaining of patellofemoral pain. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> There was a pool of 1013 running-analyses in which the subjects complained of patellofemoral complaints (234 analyses), then all dates of recreational and competitive athletes (234 analyses) were first filtered out. This resulted in an analysis number of 113 analyses, which were included. All participants were examined by a sport medicine specialist and the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome were determined by X-ray and MRI imaging. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Primary contact with the ground, malposition of the legs, Achilles tendon angle, pelvic stability, knee inflection and lower leg swing were observed via a 2D running-analyse. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> The 113 analyses were examined in terms of running technique and dynamic biomechanical misalignments. The evaluation was based on the 4-point model of Marquardt. <h3>Results</h3> It was noteworthy that in 98.2% (n = 111) of the examined subjects, the primary contact with the ground was via the heel. In 90.9% (n = 101) of these subjects, there was also increased knee flexion in the medium support phase. This was also observed in the other two subjects without heel strike (91.1% (n = 103) increased knee flexion). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The primary contact of the heel and also an increased knee flexion in the medium support phase can increased the risk of patellofemoral-pain occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3216867293,401 Bone bruise pattern and mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament injury in professional football players: correlation between MRI and video analysis,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> The presence of bone bruises (BB), especially in the lateral compartment of the knee, is a common finding in the context of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, different patterns have been described and a precise correlation with mechanism of ACL injury has never been determined. <h3>Objective</h3> To correlate the MRI features of ACL injuries with the exact injury mechanism obtained from video-analysis. Such investigation, which has never been performed up to now, provides relevant insights in the understanding ACL injury mechanism and in the genesis of intra-articular lesions such as bone bruises. <h3>Design</h3> Fifteen professional football players sustaining an ACL injury (while playing during an official match of First League Championship) were included in the study. The video of injury was obtained from the Television broadcast. Knee Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was obtained within 7 days from the injury. BB and meniscal/cartilage lesions were analyzed on MRI, while a video analysis of mechanisms of ACL injury and injury dynamics were assessed from the videos. <h3>Results</h3> The most common pattern of BB present in 8 cases (53%) was a femoral BB &gt;5 mm in the central portion of the lateral femoral condyle and in the posterior portion of the lateral tibial plateau. In all these cases, the injury occurred with single-leg load during a pivoting maneuver while changing direction during pressing (33%), dribbling (7%), goalkeeping (7%) or in response of being being tackled on the upper body (7%). All these injuries occurred without direct contact, high horizontal speed and with an abducted hip. Other patterns included BB only in tibia (20%), tibia and femur BB &lt;5 mm (7%) or no BB (20%). In these cases, injury occurred due to direct contact (20%), recovery balance after kicking (13%) or jumping (7%), and while tackling (7%). <h3>Conclusions</h3> A characteristic and well-defined BB pattern, with BB in both tibia and femur, was identified in ACL injuries without direct contact and while the football players had single-leg loading while pivoting trying to perform a sudden change of direction."

Anthropometric data, injury mechanism, and other factors were tabulated by HNF injuries and sex. Logistic regression determined the relationship between sex and HNF injuries. A final multivariable model was used to calculate the probability of HNF injuries and differences between sex and age-groups. <h3>Results</h3> From 2010–2016, 1,679 match injuries were seen (68%=men, 32%=women) injuries. A total of 474 (28%) HNF injuries were documented. The most commonly injured body part was the head (48%) with concussions (40%). Final model revealed sex, age, position during contact, contact surface, and play legality were significantly associated with HNF injuries. Controlling for play legality and position during contact, U18-men injured during contact with an opposing player had the highest probability of HNF injuries (51%) and a higher probability than U18 women (<i>P</i>=0.004). Meanwhile, women 18–24 (<i>P</i>=0.019) and over 30 (<i>P</i>=0.042) who were injured during contact with the ground had a higher probability of HNF injuries than men. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Under-18 male players involved in contact with players were most at risk for HNF injuries. Meanwhile, adult women 18–24 and 30-years old had a higher probability of sustaining a HNF injury when injured during contact with the ground. Tackle techniques, break falls, and other interactions employed by developing women and men players, including tackles or collisions, should be reviewed in detail for injury reduction."

None of these studies have investigated the potential role of how athletes perceive their injury risk, and how it may play a part in the occurrence of sport injuries. <h3>Objective</h3> Explore how Swedish track and field athletes perceive their injury risk, and examine the potential correlation with prior injury experience. <h3>Design</h3> A quantitative design, an exploratory study. <h3>Setting</h3> Swedish junior elite track and field athletes. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> The convenience sample comprised 69 out of 97 Swedish junior elite track &amp; field athletes. The entry criteria included injury free when answering the questionnaire, active in track &amp; field, participated in at least one youth or junior national team between 2013 and 2017. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> The participants had four weeks to fill out a two-part online questionnaire. The first part requested relevant personal information including previous injuries in the past 12 months; the second part consisted of 'The Perception of Risk of Injury Scale' (RISSc), but modified accordingly to the targeted sport. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> RISSc scores were set as the dependent variable. <h3>Results</h3> Non-significant results (p=0,095) were found between gender and perceived injury risk. If an athlete reported more than one injury in the past 12 months, they perceived their re-injury risk (p&lt;0,025) to be higher. Significant results were found between perceived injury risk and the severity of the injury (p&lt;0,006, r=-0,32). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Previous injury has a small correlation to perceived injury risk. It may be possible to reduce negative perceptions concerning re-injury in athletes with higher perceptions of injury risk. Awareness of re-injury should be increased among athletes with a history of severe injury. This study may serve as a springboard for additional research."
https://openalex.org/W3216988964,443 Injuries among football goalkeepers: risk factors and injury prevention program – a systematic review,2021-11-01,2021,review,"<h3>Background</h3> Previous studies have confirmed different localization of injuries in football goalkeepers (FG) compared to outfield players. However, there is a lack of systematic data regarding the injury epidemiology and potential injury prevention programs that might be implemented in this unique group of players. <h3>Objective</h3> 1) To analyze the type and localization of injuries among FG and what are the associated risk factors for these injuries 2) To verify whether there is any injury prevention program tailored for FG. <h3>Design</h3> Systematic review of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library electronic databases (search strategy available via the PROSPERO database; 2020 CRD42020183296). <h3>Setting</h3> Any football competition level. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> The study population consisted of both sexes of amateur or professional FG. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Any paper addressing the issue of injury incidence and/or prevalence and describing injury prevention program/warm-up tailored for goalkeepers. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Type of injuries, localization of injuries, types of injury prevention programs, injury incidence (injuries/1000 training or match-play hours), percentage distribution of injury type, percentage distribution of injury localization. <h3>Results</h3> Our searches identified 813 potentially relevant articles. By reviewing titles and abstracts, we identified 52 potential articles examining type and localization, and risk factors of injuries amongst FG, and biomechanical effects of applying injury prevention accessories (e.g., shorts, pads, etc.). There were no original scientific papers reporting the effectiveness of any tailored injury prevention programs implemented in a FG population. However, there was one short communication published as an abstract, confirming significant reductions in the total number of the upper extremity injuries following the application of FIFA 11+ program (RR=0.42 [0.31–0.56]; p&lt;0.00001, NNT-5.1]. <h3>Conclusions</h3> More investigations are needed to develop and evaluate effectiveness of injury prevention strategies tailored for FG."

Over a football season (2018), the DSP performed the specific warm up lasting 15 min three times weekly with a progression of intensities over time. The control group followed its routine warm up including football drills and physical warm ups without a specific prevention approach. Injuries and time exposure were recorded according to the FIFA consensus statement. Data were analysed by Chi-Square Test while the level of significant was set as p ≤0.05. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Injury incidence and risk ratio for ankle and knee. <h3>Results</h3> In total, 7020 h of training and competition and 37 lower extremity injuries were recorded; about 65% in the control group. The injury incidence for DSP and control were 1.8 and 3.4 respectively. Incidences of knee and ankle injuries for DSP and control were 1.0, 0.9, 2.3 and 1.3, respectively. The risk ratio for knee and ankle injuries was higher in the control group by 2.3 and 1.5 times, respectively. Chi-square testing indicated a significantly lower knee injury incidence for the DSP group (p=0.03). Despite a 30% lower injury incidence, the difference of ankle injuries between the groups was not significant (p=0.52). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Applying DSP as regular warm up significantly reduced the incidence of knee injuries in youth footballers, which is assumed to be due to a better stimulation of the control mechanisms of the postural system followed by performing the programme. For the ankle, exercises that are more specific should be applied though the limited small sample size may also affect the results."

Female youth are underrepresented in the sport injury literature and present with a different injury profile than males. <h3>Objective</h3> To investigate sport-related injury rates, types, locations and mechanisms in female youth team sports. <h3>Design</h3> Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> High schools in Alberta, Canada. <h3>Participants</h3> Female students who reported playing one of the top ten team sports for participation (i.e., baseball, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, volleyball, football, rugby, ringette, field hockey, ice hockey). Assessment of Risk Factors A 45-minute survey included questions regarding demographic information, sport participation, and one-year injury and concussion history. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Self-reported injuries sustained in the past year. <h3>Results</h3> 51.7% (1048/2029) of high school students completing the survey were female and 481/1048 (45.9%) reported playing at least one team sport. Of these, 51.4% reported at least one sport-related injury and 8.9% at least one concussion in the past year. Injury rate based on 'most serious injury' reported was highest in ringette (42.9 injuries/100 students/year) and rugby (40.0). The top three most serious injury locations were the knee (24.7%), ankle (21.6%) and head (16.1%). The most common injury types were joint or ligament sprain (26.7%), fracture (13.0%) and concussion (11.8%). Based on all serious injuries reported in female team sports, 73.4% occurred via contact mechanisms (with someone or something). Overuse (16.2%) was the next most common mechanism reported. Of participants that reported concussion as their most serious injury, 100% were attributed to contact mechanisms (38.9% contact with someone; 61.1% contact with something). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Team sport injury rates are high in female high school students. Specific consideration of contact injury mechanisms in female youth team sports will inform development and evaluation of targeted female contact and sport-specific prevention strategies."

However, few studies have examined the effect of gender on landing technique in athletes following ACLR. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare landing technique between females and males following ACLR during landing from heading-jump (LHJ) and landing from long-jump (LLJ). <h3>Design</h3> Cross-sectional study. <h3>Setting</h3> Biomechanical laboratory. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> Eight female and 8 male recreational athletes. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> LHJ included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force plates, whereas LLJ included jumping forward and landing on the force plates. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> A 2×2 ANOVA (gender × landing) was performed to evaluate kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography data. <h3>Results</h3> A significant interaction was found only for knee flexion angles (F1,14= 12.67, p = 0.003). Pairwise comparisons showed that males landed with decreased knee flexion compared with females during LLJ (p = 0.01). LHJ showed decreased knee flexion compared with LLJ in females (p &lt; 0.001) and males (p = 0.001). Significant main effects of landing were found. LHJ showed decreased hip flexion angles (F1,14= 71.07, p &lt; 0.001), decreased knee flexion angles (F1,14= 95.17, p &lt; 0.001), decreased knee extension moments (F1,14= 20.12, p = 0.001), and decreased plantarflexion moments (F1,14= 34.71, p &lt; 0.001). Also, a significant main effect of gender for hip flexion was found showing that males landed with decreased hip flexion angles (F1,14= 7.17, p = 0.01). <h3>Conclusions</h3> LHJ showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with LLJ. Females and males following ACLR showed nearly similar landing biomechanics. However, males landed with smaller hip and knee flexion angles (stiff-landing); therefore, preventative training programs may focus on improving the use of hip and knee joints (soft-landing) during landing to decrease the risk of consequent injuries in males following ACLR."

Data were analyzed using the Framework Method for Multidisciplinary Qualitative Analysis and transcripts were coded and analyzed by the research team. <h3>Setting</h3> Focus groups were conducted with Para athletes at the National Paralympic training center in Accra, Ghana and virtually via Zoom. <h3>Participants</h3> Twenty-six national- and international-level Para athletes with varying disabilities, 18 years or above, living and training in Ghana, India, or Brazil. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Four a priori themes with multiple subthemes were considered: characteristics of, effects of, growth after, and strategies to address abuse. <h3>Results</h3> Athletes described a wide range of harms experienced both within and outside of sport. In addition to more commonly recognized modes of abuse such as physical and sexual, athletes focused on three less easily recognized forms of abuse: financial abuse, neglect, and disability stigma. Athletes described abuse as operating on both interpersonal and systemic levels. Cultural and societal factors influenced athletes' perceptions and experiences of harms. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Para athletes from less-resourced countries represent the largest pool of global sportspersons eligible for Olympic-level participation, and have the highest need for protection against abuse, but their voices are seldom heard. Sport stakeholders concerned with abuse prevention must understand their experiences and integrate their insights and priorities into sport safeguarding policies, programs, and interventions. As new insights are added to the current evidence base, athlete-generated and locally-relevant preventative strategies can better protect all athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3217784464,194 Risk factors for graft rupture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a systematic review with meta-analysis,2021-11-01,2021,review,"<h3>Background</h3> Underlying factors contributing to increased risk of graft rupture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are not well described. <h3>Objective</h3> To systematically review intrinsic risk factors for sustaining a graft rupture. <h3>Design</h3> A systematic review with meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Sport Discus) were searched from inception to January 2020. Meta-analyses (random effect model) were performed and expressed as odds ratios (OR). <h3>Setting</h3> The included studies describe a variety of sport settings and activity levels. <h3>Participants</h3> The review comprises studies including males and/or females of any age who have had ACLR. <h3>Assessment of Risk Factors</h3> All longitudinal studies investigating any intrinsic risk factor for future graft rupture were included. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Graft rupture. <h3>Results</h3> Seventy-seven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. The following factors all independently increased the odds of sustaining a graft rupture after ACLR: Age ≤ 18 years (OR: 3.87, 95% CI: 2.32–6.46), higher pre-primary injury activity level (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.56–3.82), family history of ACL injury (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.50–2.62), returning to a high activity level (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.11–3.15), and increased lateral tibial slope (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13–2,38). None of the following factors were found to be associated with future graft rupture; sex, smoking status, generalized joint laxity, timing of surgery or return to sport (RTS), playing soccer compared to other sports, hop performance at time of RTS or concomitant meniscal or collateral ligament injuries. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Young age, family history of ACL injury, high tibial slope and previous and current high activity level should be considered when screening for increased risk of graft rupture following ACLR. Future studies on the possible role of sensorimotor factors, e.g., muscle activation and/or strength and proprioception for future graft ruptures are warranted."

A scoping review of injuries, risk factors, and prevention strategies",2021-11-01,2021,review,"<h3>Background</h3> Bicycle motocross (BMX) was officially added to the Olympics in 2008. Participation has increased over the last decade and is listed as a top sport for injury rates in multisport studies. Before effective prevention programs can be designed and implemented, it is important to understand injury risk, risk factors and potential prevention strategies. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine the evidence on injury incidence, prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and prevention implementation in BMX. <h3>Methods</h3> Five electronic databases were systematically searched in July 2020 for studies that included BMX injury as the main topic or subtopic. Two reviewers screened all studies and extracted data independently. Conflicts were resolved via consensus and a third reviewer. <h3>Results</h3> Of the 1615 unique articles screened, 36 met the inclusion criteria. Most injury surveillance based studies were conducted at elite competitions (e.g. BMX Cycling European Championship, Olympic Games, UCI BMX World Championship) or using data from the emergency department. The most common BMX injuries were fractures, lacerations, abrasions, and contusions. Risk factors included age, sex, number of riders per race, history of injury, and bicycle characteristics. Prevention strategies are limited and have not been appropriately evaluated; one study found that wearing a neck brace may reduce the number and magnitude of rotational accelerations at the head during BMX racing, but this was not evaluated for its effect on injury rates. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Most BMX studies focus on injury characteristics and do not use appropriate injury surveillance methodology. Studies based on emergency room data may underestimate less severe injuries and do not provide adequate measures of sport exposure. Reducing the number of riders per race may be a promising modifiable risk factor that requires further examination. More rigorous community-based prospective studies examining injury rates, risk factors, and prevention strategies are needed to inform widespread evidence-based prevention strategies."

Conclusions:There is consistency across the sports season in the performance variability of SLS and SLL."
https://openalex.org/W4213119039,471 The force experienced by the head during football heading is mainly influenced by the speed of the ball rather than its mechanical properties,2021-11-01,2021,article,"<h3>Background</h3> There are growing concerns about the risk of neurodegenerative diseases associated with heading in football. It is essential to understand the biomechanics of football heading to guide player protection strategies to reduce the severity of the impact. <h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to assess the effect of football speed, mass and stiffness on the forces experienced during football heading using mathematical and human body computational model simulations. <h3>Design</h3> Computational biomechanics study. <h3>Setting</h3> N/A. <h3>Patients (or Participants)</h3> N/A. <h3>Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)</h3> Football headers were reconstructed using a human body modelling approach. Simulations were run by independently varying the football mass, speed and stiffness. <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> Peak contact force experienced by the head was extracted from each simulation. <h3>Results</h3> Mathematical and human body computational model simulations indicate that the force experienced by the head was directly proportional to the speed of the ball and directly proportional to the square root of the ball stiffness and mass. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Over the practical range of ball speed, mass and stiffness, the force experienced by the head during football heading is mainly influenced by the speed of the ball rather than its mass or stiffness. The findings suggest that it would be more beneficial to develop player protection strategies that aim to reduce the speed at which the ball is travelling when headed by a player. Law changes reducing high ball speeds could be trialled at certain age grades or as a phased introduction to football heading."

To date, global positioning system (GPS) based devices are those mainly used in soccer training. The aim of this study was to analyse the validity and reliability of the inertial sensor device (ISD) in monitoring distance and speed in a soccer-specific circuit and how their performance compare to a GPS system. 44 young male soccer players (age: 14.9 ± 1.1, range 9-16, years, height: 1.65 ± 0.10 m, body mass: 56.3 ± 8.9 kg) playing in a non-professional soccer team in Italy, participated in the study. We assessed the players trough a soccer running sport-specific circuit. An ISD and a GPS were used to assess distance and speed. Data was compared to a video reference system, and the difference were quantified by means of the root mean square error (RMSE). Significant differences were found for both GPS and ISD devices for distance and speed. However, lower error for distance (dRMSE 2.23 ± 1.01 m and 5.75 ± 1.50 m, respectively) and speed (sRMSE 0.588 ± 0.152 m·s-1 and 1.30 ± 0.422 m·s-1, respectively) were attained by the ISD compared to the GPS. Overall, our results revealed a statistically significant difference between systems in data monitoring for either distance and speed. However, results of this study showed that a smaller error was obtained with the ISD than the GPS device. Despite caution is warranted within the interpretation of these results, we observed a better practical applicability of the ISD due to its small size, lower cost and the possibility to use the device indoor."

Multiple frameworks have been proposed to mine, store, preprocess, and analyze physiological vitals data using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, less research has been done to collect potentially high volume, high-quality ‘big data’ in an organized, time-synchronized, and holistic manner to solve similar problems in multiple fields. Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports. The AIBSNF may provide a solid blueprint for conducting research and development, forming a smooth end-to-end pipeline from data collection using BSN, RTLS and final stage analytics based on AI/ML algorithms."

One hundred and three recreational runners (30 ± 7.2 years old, 39% females) were randomly assigned to either: a barefoot retraining group (BAR) with 3 sessions/week over 10 weeks, a cadence retraining group (CAD) who increased cadence by 10% again with 3 sessions/week over 10 weeks and a control group (CON) who did not perform any retraining. The footstrike pattern, footstrike angle (FSA), and spatial-temporal variables at comfortable and high speeds were measured using 2D/3D photogrammetry and a floor-based photocell system. A 3 × 2 ANOVA was used to compare between the groups and 2 time points. The FSA significantly reduced at the comfortable speed by 5.81° for BAR (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.749) and 4.81° for CAD (p = 0.002; Cohen's d = 0.638), and at high speed by 6.54° for BAR (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.753) and by 4.71° for CAD (p = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.623). The cadence significantly increased by 2% in the CAD group (p = 0.015; Cohen's d = 0.344) at comfortable speed and the BAR group showed a 1.7% increase at high speed. BAR and CAD retraining programs showed a moderate effect for reducing FSA and rearfoot prevalence, and a small effect for increasing cadence. Both offer low-cost and feasible tools for gait modification within recreational runners in clinical scenarios."

Students are often injured while playing sports. The main condition for preventing injuries is the correct technique of movements. In the literature, rock climbing has not been analyzed in terms of prevention of student injuries. Therefore, the development of programs to prevent injuries of students-rock climbers is relevant. Aim: to determine the impact of the use of exercises in a closed kinematic chain on the technical skill and the number of injuries to the elbows of student-rock climbers based on the analysis of the one-arm hang technique. Material and methods. First, to substantiate the correct technique in rock climbing, the technique of performing one-arm hang was analyzed by 20 leading male climbers of Ukraine and 20 students - novice male climbers. Then a randomized control study was conducted. The participants in the randomized control study were 40 male students-climbers in the intervention group and 44 male students-climbers in the control group aged 18-19 years. The one-arm hang technique was determined based on the angles between the shoulder and the collarbone during the movement. The experiment lasted 1 year. At the beginning and at the end of the experiment, the analysis of the one-arm hang technique was carried out. The number of elbow injuries in both groups was also recorded. Results. The main parameters of the one-arm hang technique for qualified and unskilled climbers have been substantiated. For qualified climbers, one-arm hang involves the muscles of the shoulder girdle, torso, and legs. In unskilled climbers, one-arm hang is provided only by the muscles of the arm. In a control randomized study, there was a significant improvement in the results of biomechanical analysis of the hang technique in athletes in the intervention group (p &lt;0.001). The use of exercises in a closed kinematic chain significantly reduces the incidence rate of elbow injuries in student-climbers (p &lt;0.05). The odds rate of mild elbow injuries in the control group was 4.625 times higher than the intervention one (95% CI: 1.198; 17.854), the odds rate of moderate injuries in the control group was 5.588 times higher than in the control group than the intervention one (95% CI: 1.143; 27.324). Conclusions. Exercises in closed kinematic chains are an effective means of improving climbing technique and injury preventing to university students during rock climbing."

A previous study had established the normative scores of a population in the USA but included knees with pathology. The aim of our study is to obtain normative Forgotten Joint Scores in young Asian adults without any pre-existing knee pathologies to increase the interpretability of the Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) score.We conducted a cross-sectional study across young healthy Asian adults via electronic platforms. Participants who had sought either Western medical consultation, physiotherapy or traditional medical therapies were excluded. Demographic data, occupation, type of sport played, and FJS-12 scores were collected. Scores were stratified into subgroups and analysed.There were 172 participants who met our inclusion criteria for this study. The average age of participants in our study was 28.1 ± 10.5 years (range 14-70 years), with 83 (47.7%) participants falling into the ages 21-25 years. Average body mass index (BMI) was 21.9 ± 3.3 kg/m2 (range 14.7-36.3 kg/m2). The average FJS-12 score was 62.8 ± 25.6. The median FJS-12 was 63.5 with a range of 4.2-100. Nine participants (5.2%) scored the maximum score possible, and 56 (32.6%) participants scored below the midpoint score of 50. The percentiles for each subgroup of participants were tabulated and reported. Notably, males aged 46-70 years old scored the highest average FJS-12 score of 73.4 ± 5.5, and females aged 31-45 years old scored the lowest FJS-12 score of 57.1 ± 25.1. Females scored lower than males, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.157). There were no significant correlations between BMI, age, or type of sport played with FJS-12; however, interestingly, we observed that women reported similar FJS-12 scores across all age groups, while men reported better scores with increasing age.Interestingly, we observed that women reported similar FJS-12 scores across all age groups, while men reported better scores with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Having normative values provides opportunities for benchmarking and comparing individuals against age- and gender-matched peers in the general population. Knowledge of normative values for FJS-12 scores would aid evaluating and tracking progress in patients recovering from injuries or undergoing post-surgery rehabilitation. This would help clinicians determine if they return to 'normal' post intervention."

The purpose of this study is to describe the anatomy of the musculo-ligamentous connection between the sMCL and the Vastus Medialis Obliquus muscle (VMO), and to describe its anatomy. Methods: Six Human Cadaveric knees were used in this study. Donors were 4 males and 2 females with a mean age of 49 years old. Dissection was performed in fixed knee extension and directed to show the area of the proximal attachment of the sMCL. Results: A musculo ligamentous connection between the distal portion of the Vastus medialis Obliquus muscle and the sMCL has been identified in our entire specimens. The mean mid substance width of this connection was 9.75 (8.7 -10.8) mm, the mean length was 29.3 (22.2-36.4) mm and the mean thickness was 1.3 (0.9-1.7) mm. Conclusion: The proximal femoral attachment of the sMCL is directly connected to the distal end of VMO. This connection may show that the sMCL can possibly assist in the dynamic stabilization of the knee during extension against valgus stress, through its tension by the contracted VMO muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3210757761,The Role of Nonlinear Pedagogy in Supporting the Design of Modified Games in Junior Sports,2021-10-29,2021,review,"Nonlinear Pedagogy has been advocated as an approach that views acquisition of movement skills with a strong emphasis on exploratory behaviors and the development of individualized movement skills. Underpinned by Ecological Dynamics, Nonlinear Pedagogy provides key ideas on design principles to support a teaching and learning approach that accounts for dynamic interactions among constraints in the evolution of movement behaviors. In the context of junior sports, the manipulation of task constraints is central to how games can be re-designed for children to play that are age and body appropriate so that the games can still capture the key elements of representativeness as compared to the adult form of the game. Importantly, these games offer suitable affordances that promote sensible play that could be transferable to other contexts. In this paper, we provide an in-depth discussion on how Nonlinear Pedagogy is relevant in supporting the design and development of modified games in the context of junior sports. Practical implications are also provided to share how games can be modified for meaningful play to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W3211329487,"Quantifying Fatigue in the Rugby Codes: The Interplay Between Collision Characteristics and Neuromuscular Performance, Biochemical Measures, and Self-Reported Assessments of Fatigue",2021-10-29,2021,review,"Locomotor and collision actions that rugby players complete during match-play often lead to substantial fatigue, and in turn, delays in recovery. The methods used to quantify post-match fatigue and recovery can be categorised as subjective and objective, with match-related collision characteristics thought to have a primary role in modulating these recovery measures. The aim of this review was to (1) evaluate how post-match recovery has been quantified in the rugby football codes (i.e., rugby league, rugby union, and rugby sevens), (2) to explore the time-course of commonly used measures of fatigue post-match, and (3) to investigate the relationships between game-related collisions and fatigue metrics. The available evidence suggests that upper-, and lower-body neuromuscular performance are negatively affected, and biomarkers of muscular damage and inflammation increase in the hours and days following match-play, with the largest differences being at 12–36 h post-match. The magnitude of such responses varies within and between neuromuscular performance (Δ ≤ 36%, n = 13 studies) and tissue biomarker (Δ ≤ 585%, n = 18 studies) measures, but nevertheless appears strongly related to collision frequency and intensity. Likewise, the increase in perceived soreness in the hours and days post-match strongly correlate to collision characteristics across the rugby football codes. Within these findings, there are specific differences in positional groups and recovery trajectories between the codes which relate to athlete characteristics, and/or locomotor and collision characteristics. Finally, based on these findings, we offer a conceptual model of fatigue which details the multidimensional latent structure of the load to fatigue relationship contextualised to rugby. Research to date has been limited to univariate associations to explore relationships between collision characteristics and recovery, and multivariate methods are necessary and recommended to account for the latent structures of match-play external load and post-match fatigue constructs. Practitioners should be aware of the typical time windows of fatigue recovery and utilise both subjective and objective metrics to holistically quantify post-match recovery in rugby."

It provided us with a better understanding of our health problems through many diagnostic and treatment tools yet, many medical colleges do not fully implement physics as a core subject in their curricula. Physics is taught only as a freshman year subject, and many medical students feel obliged to take it without knowing its real benefits to their future careers. This is basically due to the lack of an appropriate course design, references, and the poor commissioning of physics in the medical field. The aim of this work is to propose a series of courses of physics in medicine that would fulfill the requirements of any medical college. Methods The presented courses will be divided into three phases: premedical, pre-clinical, and clinical years for medical students. To do so, a critical analysis of the topics needed at the different phases and the possibilities of implementing this syllabus and constraints that may face the process is conducted. Results the different topics are shown and means of implementing them as a single subject or in conjunction with other subjects is clarified Conclusion Once properly tailored, physics can provide a strong tool in medical education"

No study has investigated this in adolescents, or the role of fast bowling technique on lumbar BMD adaptation. This study aims to investigate lumbar BMD adaptation in adolescent cricket fast bowlers, and its relationship with fast bowling technique.Thirty-nine adolescent fast bowlers underwent anteroposterior dual x-ray absorptiometry scan of their lumbar spine. Hip, lumbopelvic and thoracolumbar joint kinematics, and vertical ground reaction kinetics were determined using three-dimensional motion capture and force plates. Significant partial (covariate: fat-free mass) and bivariate correlations of the technique parameters with whole lumbar (L1-L4) BMD and BMD asymmetry (L3 and L4) were advanced as candidate variables for multiple stepwise linear regression.Adolescent fast bowlers demonstrated high lumbar Z-Scores (+1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.4) and significantly greater BMD on the contralateral side of L3 (9.0%; 95% CI, 5.8%-12.1%) and L4 (8.2%; 95% CI, 4.9%-11.5%). Maximum contralateral thoracolumbar rotation and maximum ipsilateral lumbopelvic rotation in the period between back foot contact and ball release (BR), as well as contralateral pelvic drop at front foot contact, were identified as predictors of L1 to L4 BMD, explaining 65% of the variation. Maximum ipsilateral lumbopelvic rotation between back foot contact and BR, as well as ipsilateral lumbopelvic rotation and contralateral thoracolumbar side flexion at BR, were predictors of lumbar asymmetry within L3 and L4.Thoracolumbar and lumbopelvic motion are implicated in the etiology of the unique lumbar bone adaptation observed in fast bowlers whereas vertical ground reaction force, independent of body mass, was not. This may further implicate the osteogenic potential of torsional rather than impact loading in exercise-induced adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3208173341,Is There Any Non-functional Training? A Conceptual Review,2021-10-28,2021,review,"This conceptual review aimed to investigate whether ""functional training"" (FT) programs are different from traditional strength, power, flexibility, and endurance training programs. A search for the twenty most recent papers published involving FT was performed in the PubMed/Medline database. Definition, concepts, benefits, and the exercises employed in FT programs were analyzed. The main results were: 1) there is no agreement about a universal definition for FT; 2) FT programs aim at developing the same benefits already induced by traditional strength, power, flexibility, and endurance training programs; 3) exercises employed are also the same. The inability to define FT makes differentiation difficult. Physical training programs can be easily described and classified as strength, power, flexibility, endurance, and the specific exercises employed (e.g., traditional resistance training, ballistic exercises, plyometrics and Olympic-style weightlifting, continuous and high-intensity interval training). This proper description and classification may improve communication in sports science and improve interdisciplinary integration. Aiming to avoid confusion and misconceptions, and based on the current evidence, we recommend that the terms FT, high-intensity FT, and functional fitness training no longer describe any physical training program."

The task was performed by two groups of soccer players (10 novices and 10 experts, aged 16-19 years) and the differences between the two groups, in terms of these parameters, were also assessed. MethodsThe calibration procedure of the combined system is presented in this paper. The system measured the Centre of Pressure (CoP) and body Center of Mass (CoM) displacements, kicking duration and the acceleration of the kicking leg. ResultsThe margin of error found for kinematic and kinetic calibration was less than 1%. Furthermore, the expert players presented decreased CoP and CoM displacements and kicking duration and acceleration of the kicking leg compared to the novices. ConclusionThe combined system provides an effective method for the simultaneous measurement of kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with kicking and may contribute to the development of intervention studies for the improvement of balance and kicking performance in sports."
https://openalex.org/W3209771369,Study of Anthropomentric and Morphometric Parameters in the Training of Athletes,2021-10-27,2021,article,"The purpose of the work was to study the patterns of development and formation of the structure of the skeletal, muscular, circulatory system under the influence of various physical activities in the dynamics, followed by the definition of correlations of the value of anthropometric and morphometric parameters in the training of athletes. Studying of the literature data, we can conclude that modern professional sports requires loads close to maximum, and sometimes even exceeding them, the establishment of these maximum permissible loads and the study of the patterns of their development is a very urgent task. The main problem in training athletes is adequate selection and sports affiliation. Solving the problems of selection involves the creation of a model of the athlete of this specialization, that is a certain set of characteristics that determine athletic performance. This requires anthropometric assessment, morphometric and biometric data to track physical and physiological parameters, information to assess performance and recovery in sports, modification of training regimes to prevent injuries, provide guidance on regulating the use of technologies used in professional sports, as well as to research and make recommendations for the proper collection, storage and exchange of health information. One of important problems of modern morphology is the study of changes that occur in the body under the influence of various factors. This problem has become especially important in connection with the development of sports. High sports performance, associated with a significant load on the athlete's body, encourages scientists, doctors, coaches to search for physiological reserves of the body and search for optimal training regimes. From this point of view, the study of changes that occur in individual organs, systems and in the body as a whole, under the influence of physical activity of varying intensity and nature is relevant and of great practical importance. Conclusion. Modern professional sports require loads that are close to the maximum, and sometimes are such or exceed them. It is the establishment of these maximum allowable loads and study the patterns of their development which is a very promising area. This will allow timely selection of athletes for a particular sport, to carry out preventive and curative measures to improve their structural and functional condition"

Therefore, the aim of the current investigation was to assess the relationship between the flexor/extensor strength ratio and the range of motion of the knee joints and VGRF during jump in a sample of young healthy men. The sample consisted of 64 healthy, active men. The flexor and extensor torques and ranges of active and passive mobility of both knee joints were measured. Vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) was measured using two platforms. There were no significant correlations between the symmetry of muscle strength and the symmetry of ranges of motion and the symmetry of the VGRF. Therefore, using the cluster analysis, 4 subgroups were distinguished due to the size of the flexor/extensor ratio (H/Q ratio). Significant differences were found in the level of strength of the knee flexors between the clusters. Detailed analysis of muscle strength symmetry and VGRF symmetry seem to confirm the Leading Joint Hypothesis theory of motion control in multi-joint systems. It was found that the process of controlling movement by the nervous system compensates for the small asymmetries in the level of muscle strength in the knee flexors and extensors, as well as small asymmetries of VGRF."

The rectus femoris has a region-specific functional role; the proximal region of the rectus femoris contributes more than the middle and distal regions during hip flexion. Although a history of strain injury modifies the region-specific functional role within the rectus femoris, it was not obvious which rectus femoris strain injury types affect regional activation within it. We studied 12 soccer players with a history of rectus femoris strain injury. Injury data were obtained from a questionnaire survey and magnetic resonance imaging. To confirm the region-specific functional role of the rectus femoris, surface multichannel electromyographic signals were recorded. Accordingly, eight legs had a history of central tendon injury, four had a history of myofascial junction injury, and four had a healed strain injury. When the injury was limited to the central tendon, the region-specific functional role disappeared. The region-specific functional role was confirmed when the injury was outside the central part. The neuromuscular function was also inhibited when the longitudinal range of the injured region was long. Our findings suggest that a central tendon injury with a long injury length impairs regional neuromuscular activation of the rectus femoris muscle."

This study aimed to compare the performances of olympic deaf and elite normal-hearing volleyball players in different jumping test protocols. A total of 26 male volleyball players participated in the study, comprised of 12 olympic level deaf and 14 elite level normal-hearing. Following anthropometric measurements, athletes performed bilateral counter movement, squat and drop jump tests on a force plate. Each test was performed 3 times with maximal effort separated by 45 seconds of passive recovery and the mean of the three trials was selected for analysis. Independent Samples t-test was used to compare the differences in mean values of jumping test parameters between the groups. Normal-hearing athletes are observed to have significantly better scores than deaf athletes in all test protocols. Considering that the number of studies on athletic performance in deaf athletes is limited, it can be said that our study will contribute to researchers and coaches in respect of detecting a key ability in volleyball, such as jumping, in different jump protocols."

Studies were considered if they reported injury incidence rate in male and female youth (≤19 years old) football players. Two reviewers (FJRP and ALV) extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach determined the quality of evidence. Studies were combined using a Poisson random effects regression model.Forty-three studies were included. The overall incidence rate was 5.70 injuries/1000 h in males and 6.77 injuries/1000 h in females. Match injury incidence (14.43 injuries/1000 h in males and 14.97 injuries/1000 h in females) was significantly higher than training injury incidence (2.77 injuries/1000 h in males and 2.62 injuries/1000 h in females). The lower extremity had the highest incidence rate in both sexes. The most common type of injury was muscle/tendon for males and joint/ligament for females. Minimal injuries were the most common in both sexes. The incidence rate of injuries increased with advances in chronological age in males. Elite male players presented higher match injury incidence than sub-elite players. In females, there was a paucity of data for comparison across age groups and levels of play.The high injury incidence rates and sex differences identified for the most common location and type of injury reinforce the need for implementing different targeted injury-risk mitigation strategies in male and female youth football players."

The objectives of this study were to assess the inter-and intra-rater agreement when using new observational screening guidelines to decide if a core stability exercise represents an adequate training intensity level for a given participant. Besides, the relationship between experts' ratings based on these criteria and pelvic accelerations recorded with a smartphone accelerometer was also analyzed. Ten healthy physically active participants with a smartphone accelerometer placed on their pelvis were video-taped while performing a progression of seven variations of the front bridge, back bridge, side bridge and bird-dog exercises. Two expert and four non-expert raters watched the videos and used the observational screening guidelines to decide for each exercise variation if it represented an adequate training intensity level or not. In order to analyze the inter-and intra-rater agreement, several Kappa (κ) statistics were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to explore if the accelerometry allowed to establish pelvic acceleration thresholds representing the minimum level of exercise intensity for CS training. Cut-off acceleration values were calculated balancing sensitivity (Se) and 1-specifity (1-Sp) indexes (i.e., Youden index) or minimizing 1-Sp. The intra-and inter-rater analysis showed a substantial-high level of agreement with a prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted Kappa > 0.69. The ROC curves showed that the acceleration thresholds for the bridging exercises were very similar, with global cut-off values of 0.35 m/s2 (Se = 82%; 1-Sp = 15%) when using the Youden Index and of 0.50 m/s2 when minimizing 1-Sp (Se = 31%), whilst the bird-dog exercise showed lower cut-off values (Youden Index: 0.21 m/s2, Se = 90%, 1-Sp = 16%; minimizing 1-Sp: 0.32 m/s2, Se = 40%). Overall, this study provides observational screening guidelines and smartphone accelerometer thresholds to facilitate the decision-making process when setting the intensity of some of the most popular core stability exercises in young physically active individuals."

The role of the brain-gut connection and changes in the microbiota have not been well established after a head injury or concussion-related health consequences. We recruited 33 Division I Collegiate football players and collected blood, stool, and saliva samples throughout the athletic season. Analysis of the gut microbiome reveals a decrease in abundance for two bacterial species, Eubacterium rectale , and Anaerostipes hadrus , after a diagnosed concussion. No significant differences were found regarding the salivary microbiome. Serum biomarker analysis shows an increase in GFAP blood levels in athletes during athletic activity. Additionally, S100β and SAA blood levels were positively correlated with the abundance of Eubacterium rectale species among athletes exposed to subconcussive impacts. These novel findings provide evidence that detecting changes in the gut microbiome may pave the way for improved concussion diagnosis following head injury."

The summer and winter Olympic games will be held over a 7-month period in 2021-2022. Objectives: We took this rare opportunity to quantify and analyze the main bibliometric parameters (i.e., the number of articles and citations) across all Olympic sports to weigh and compare their importance and to assess the structure of the ""sport sciences"" field. The present review aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of Olympic sports research. We quantified the following topics: (1) the most investigated sports; (2) the main journals in which the studies are published; (3) the main factors explaining sport-specific scientific attractiveness; (4) the influence of being in the Olympic programme, economic weight, and local influences on research output; and (5) which research topic is the most investigated across sports. Methods: We searched 116 sport/exercise journals on PubMed for the 40 summer and 10 winter Olympic sports. A total of 34,038 articles were filtered for a final selection of 25,003 articles (23,334 articles on summer sports and 1,669 on winter sports) and a total of 599,820 citations. Results and Discussion: Nine sports [football (soccer), cycling, athletics, swimming, distance & marathon running, basketball, baseball, tennis, and rowing] were involved in 69% of the articles and 75% of the citations. Football was the most cited sport, with 19.7 and 26.3% of the total number of articles and citations, respectively. All sports yielded some scientific output, but 11 sports (biathlon, mountain biking, archery, diving, trampoline, skateboarding, skeleton, modern pentathlon, luge, bobsleigh, and curling) accumulated a total of fewer than 50 publications. While ice hockey is the most prominently represented winter sport in the scientific literature, winter sports overall have produced minor scientific output. Further analyses show a large scientific literature on team sports, particularly American professional sports (i.e., baseball, basketball, and ice hockey) and the importance of inclusion in the Olympic programme to increasing scientific interest in ""recent"" sports (i.e., triathlon and rugby sevens). We also found local/cultural influence on the occurrence of a sport in a particular ""sport sciences"" journal. Finally, the relative distribution of six main research topics (i.e., physiology, performance, training and testing, injuries and medicine, biomechanics, and psychology) was large across sports and reflected the specific performance factors of each sport."

This study aimed to determine the level of isokinetic strength bilateral asymmetry (BA) among knee extensors (KEs) and knee flexors (KFs) of elite youth soccer players. The sample (n = 87) consisted of three age categories of under 13 (U13), under 15 (U15), and under 17 (U17) years old. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to obtain the maximum peak torque of the KEs and KFs in the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs during concentric muscle contraction. The analysis revealed significantly lower values (p &lt; 0.05) of BA in KEs in U17 than in younger categories, U13 and U15, and higher values (p &lt; 0.05) of BA in KFs in the U15 category than in the U17category. The majority of the players in the U15 category (68%) reached KFs BA higher than 10% in comparison with U13 players (50%) and U17 players (28% of players) (p &lt; 0.05). Our results showed a significant effect of age category on BA levels in young soccer players. High incidences of increased BA in the lower limbs occurred in the younger categories (U13, U15) and subsequently decreased in the later adolescent stages."

Variables such as the type of foot and the windlass mechanism (WM) could influence this balance and therefore the risk of injury to the lower limb. Currently no studies are reported that relate these elements to each other in soccer players. Objective: To determine the influence of some characteristics of the foot on the risk of injury associated with DB in young soccer players. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional, and correlational study. Forty players were included in the male sub 20 category. DB was evaluated by means of the Y balance test (YBT). To determine the type of the foot, the Herzco method and Jack's test were used to evaluate the WM. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the type of the foot and the Jack test with some scopes of the YBT. There was a significant relationship between the left WM vs left DB. Conclusion: Foot’s type and the WM influence the DB. The WM could be related to the DB, however, there seems to be no relationship between Hallux’s evaluation and foot type with the DB. Variables such as the quality of execution of the sporting gesture, exposure to load, among others, should be considered when studing the issue."

American football provides a good population for attempting to predict injuries due to their relatively high injury rate. Physical performance can be assessed a variety of ways using an assortment of different tests to assess a diverse set of metrics, which may include reaction time, speed, acceleration, and deceleration. Asymmetry, the difference between right and left performance has been identified as a possible risk factor for injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the whole-body reactive agility metrics that would identify Division I football players who were at elevated risk for core, and lower extremity injuries (CLEI). This cohort study utilized 177 Division I football players with a total of 57 CLEI suffered who were baseline tested prior to the season. Single-task and dual-task whole-body reactive agility movements in lateral and diagonal direction reacting to virtual reality targets were analyzed separately. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses narrowed the 34 original predictor variables to five variables. Logistic regression analysis determined the three strongest predictors of CLEI for this cohort to be: lateral agility acceleration asymmetry, lateral flanker deceleration asymmetry, and diagonal agility reaction time average. Univariable analysis found odds ratios to range from 1.98 to 2.75 for these predictors of CLEI. ROC analysis had an area under the curve of 0.702 for any combination of two or more risk factors produced an odds ratio of 5.5 for risk of CLEI. These results suggest an asymmetry of 8-15% on two of the identified metrics or a slowed reaction time of ≥0.787 s places someone at increased risk of injury. Sixty-three percent (36/57) of the players who sustained an injury had ≥2 positive predictors In spite of the recognized limitation, these finding support the belief that whole-body reactive agility performance can identify Division I football players who are at elevated risk for CLEI."

The athletic motor skill competencies (AMSCs) have been identified as key skills that form the foundations of all athletic movements. The AMSCs form an integral part of the long-term athletic development of youth, and improving these qualities should be central to coaches working with young individuals. Multiple movement competency screens assess some aspects of the AMSC spectrum, but there is no consensus regarding which screens may be most appropriate for a given cohort or coaching environment. This review provides an evaluation of the movement screens available to assess various AMSCs and in turn considers their reliability, feasibility, strengths, and weaknesses when used with youth populations."

https://openalex.org/W3205520436,"Fatigue does not increase limb asymmetry or induce proximal joint power shift during sprinting in habitual, multi-speed runners",2021-10-18,2021,preprint,"ABSTRACT The ability to shift from walking and jogging to sprinting gaits, even when fatigued after prolonged effort, would have been as useful to our hunter-gatherer ancestors as it is to modern athletes. During prolonged jogging, joint moment and work decrease in the distal (ankle) joint but increase at proximal (hip/knee) joints as fatigue progresses, and such adaptations might be expected to occur in sprinting. Fatigue is also thought to increase inter-limb kinematic and force production asymmetries, which are speculated to influence injury risk. However, the effects of running-related fatigue on sprint running gait have been incompletely studied, so these hypotheses remain untested. We studied 3-D kinematics and ground reaction force production in dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NDL) legs during both non-fatigued and fatigued sprinting in habitual but uncoached running athletes. Contrary to the tested hypotheses, relative between-leg differences were greater in non-fatigued than fatigued sprinting. When not fatigued, DL produced greater propulsive impulse through both greater positive and negative work being done at the ankle, whilst NDL produced more vertical impulse, possibly resulting from the greater hip flexion observed prior to the downwards acceleration of the foot towards the ground. Whilst few changes were detected in DL once fatigued, NDL shifted towards greater horizontal force production, largely resulting from an increase in plantarflexion (distal-joint) moments and power. After fatiguing running, therefore, inter-limb asymmetry was reduced during sprinting and no distal-to-proximal shift in work/power was detected. Speculatively, these adaptations may help to attenuate decreases in running speed whilst minimising injury risk. Significance The ability to attain fast running speeds may critically determine success in tasks such as prey chase- and-capture in hunter-gatherer societies as well as success in modern sports competitions. At times, sprint running may have to be performed whilst fatigued from previous, longer-distance running, when speeds are reduced, and injury risk may be higher. Previous work indicated that fatigue prompts a proximal shift in joint work and power production and an increase in inter-limb asymmetry. On the contrary, we show that relative ankle positive and negative joint work was maintained in the face of fatigue and that inter-limb asymmetry was reduced in a group of runners experienced, but not formally instructed, in both long-distance and sprint running."

A different way of thinking is required to fully comprehend why, and how, these injuries occur. The systems thinking perspective offers tools and techniques to capture system-wide interactions in causal, closed-loop structures which may be studied and quantified in a practical way. The value of systems thinking in sport may only realise when pragmatic models follow descriptive, qualitative models. This article instantiates a qualitative, systems thinking perspective of the runner as a complex adaptive system with a hybrid simulation model. The approach is substantiated with principles from physics and physiology and is partially driven by data from a running watch. Results demonstrate that the scientific, reductionist method may be augmented with dynamic, closed-loop thinking and simulation modelling."

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a useful method to improve both cardiovascular and neuromuscular performance. The 30–15IFT is a field test reflecting the effort elicited by HIIT, and the final velocity reached in the test is used to set the intensity of HIIT during the training session. In order to have a valid measure of the velocity during training, devices such as GPS can be used. However, in several situations (e.g., indoor setting), such devices do not provide reliable measures. The aim of the study was to predict exact running velocity during the 30–15IFT using accelerometry-derived metrics (i.e., Player Load and Average Net Force) and heart rate (HR) through a machine learning (ML) approach (i.e., Support Vector Machine) with a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The SVM approach showed the highest performance to predict running velocity (r = 0.91) when compared to univariate approaches using PL (r = 0.62), AvNetForce (r = 0.73) and HR only (r = 0.87). In conclusion, the presented multivariate ML approach is able to predict running velocity better than univariate ones, and the model is generalizable across subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3205358873,Linking psychological risk profiles to running-related injuries and chronic fatigue in long-distance runners: A latent profile analysis,2021-10-15,2021,article,"Consistently predicting adverse outcomes of long-distance running, such as running-related injuries (RRIs) and chronic fatigue, has proven to be a complicated matter. However, research suggests that a stronger focus on psychological factors of runners might provide further insights. Consequently, in this study, we explored the interplay between self-regulatory coping strategies and motivational aspects. Using a person-centered approach, we investigated whether latent psychological profiles of runners were associated with RRIs and chronic fatigue. Questionnaire data were gathered from Dutch recreational long-distance runners (N = 425) using a cross-sectional design. We determined whether specific psychological combinations (i.e., latent profiles) based on coping strategies (i.e., running-related resources and recovery) and motivational aspects (i.e., harmonious and obsessive passion) could be distinguished using latent profile analysis (LPA). The resulting profiles were tested for their associations with RRIs and chronic fatigue. LPA revealed three different psychological risk profiles, termed the 'low-risk', 'medium-risk', and 'high-risk' profile. The low-risk profile showed low scores on obsessive passion and high scores on all recovery dimensions, whereas the high-risk profile resembled the opposite pattern. Furthermore, the low-risk profile showed significantly fewer RRIs and lower chronic fatigue scores than the high-risk profile. The results reveal that (1) patterns of passion and coping strategies interact in defining different profiles and (2) that such profiles are indeed linked to RRIs and chronic fatigue. Utilizing profiles might enable targeted intervention and more effective preventative measures by pinpointing at-risk runners. Specific combinations of psychological aspects, as reflected by our profiles, thus appear a worthwhile direction to consider in understanding RRIs and chronic fatigue in long-distance running."

Physical differences in appearance also make these adolescents prone to peer bullying and at further risk for social functioning challenges. These social functioning challenges may involve underlying difficulties with cognitive functions needed to support adaptive social functioning and can present as social isolation, inappropriate social behaviors, or social anxiety. Promoting social participation is a recognized intervention to support positive mental health and is necessary for identity formation during transition into adulthood. This guideline describes assessment and intervention for adolescents with burn injury to improve adaptive capacities and facilitate social participation. Assessment of social-cognitive skills, resilience, and behavioral indicators of adaptive social functioning are discussed. A cognitive-approach to intervention is also described. The goal of this guideline is to enable occupational therapists to provide psychosocial assessment and intervention to adolescents with burn injury. We hope that this guideline is an impetus for evidence-based practice on the role occupational therapists can contribute to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and provide more comprehensive patient care for this population."

The sample included 13 young male handball players (age: 22.4 ± 3.2 years). The CoD tasks were performed over a 10 m distance with 90° and 180° turns. Both CoD tasks were performed under two conditions: (1) from the standing start and, (2) with a 10 m prior acceleration approach. Linear sprint times over a 10 m distance were also recorded for the purpose of determining the CoD deficit. The differences between the outcomes of different test variants were assessed with pairwise t-tests and associated Cohen’s d effect size. The agreement in terms of inter-limb asymmetry direction was assessed descriptively, using percentage of agreement. Results showed that the inclusion of the 10 m approach reduced the total task time (mean differences ranging between 0.26 and 0.35 s; d = 2.27–4.02; p &lt; 0.002). The differences between 90° and 180° turn times were statistically significant under both conditions: (a) without approach (0.44–0.48 s; d = 4.72–4.84; all p &lt; 0.001), and (b) with approach (0.50–0.54 s; d = 4.41–5.03; p &lt; 0.001). The agreement regarding inter-limb asymmetry direction among the tasks was 30.7–61.5%. The differences between the tasks could be explained by the angle–velocity trade-off. The results of this study imply that the CoD tasks should not be used interchangeably when assessing inter-limb asymmetries."

This work proved to be a great step forward since reliance is increasing on these PSS as they are now the “final decision” for impact detection in Taekwondo. Furthermore, our algorithms use edge computing that allow for real time application and at-home training.&lt;/div&gt;"

Irritation and restriction during sportive activities due to the implanted materials are a common reason for impaired function and implant removal. The aim of this study was to gain information on functional outcome and time until return to sport (RTS) after surgical treatment of unstable lateral clavicle fractures, comparing two coracoclavicular button techniques. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who were consecutively treated for unstable lateral clavicle fractures at our level one trauma center from 2014 to 2018 was conducted. Two different surgical techniques were evaluated and compared. Group 1 was treated using a locking compression plate and knotted DogBone™ Button, while group 2 received an LCP and knotless DogBone™ Button. Functional outcome (ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Score), Constant-Score, DASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand), MSQ (Munich Shoulder Questionnaire) and SPADI (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index) and time until RTS were investigated and compared between both groups, 1 year postoperatively. Results: A total of 56 patients (n = 35 group 1, n = 21 group 2) with a mean age of 45.1 ± 14.6 years met the inclusion criteria. Functional outcome reached good to excellent results (ASES 94.7 ± 9.8, Constant Score 85.1 ± 8.1, DASH 5.5 ± 8.4, MSQ 90.9 ± 7.2, SPADI 96.1 ± 5.7). Implant removal rates were higher in group 1 (48.3% vs. 35.3%) yet without statistical significance (p = 0.122). All patients returned to sports postoperatively with a mean time period until return to sport of 4.6 (3–9) months. Conclusion: Locking compression plating and coracoclavicular fixation using a knotless Dogbone™ technique provides good to excellent functional outcomes, a high and fast rate of return to sport and lower irritation rates compared to the knotted DogBone™ technique."

The present study involved 54 female football players (21.9 ± 4.9 years old) from three different teams competing in the Spanish Reto Iberdrola-Segunda División PRO league. A battery of tests was carried out to determine the anthropometric and physical performance characteristics of the players along with an injury incidence record during a full competitive season. The obtained results showed that there was a high incidence of injury, as 38% of the players suffered some type of injury during the season (range 1-5; 1.75 ± 1.02 injuries per player). Injuries occurred in both matches and during training at a similar percentage (48.6 vs. 51.4%), and the majority of the registered episodes were graded as moderate or severe injury types (60%). Players suffering from an injury accumulated a total of 1587 chronological days off work due to injury during the season, with a recurrence rate of 55%. Considering the high incidence of injury, and the injury burden and the reinjure rate observed in this research, it seems necessary to apply the most efficient prevention and recovery measures possible in these female football teams. These descriptive data could serve athletic trainers and medical staff of female football teams to better understand their own screening procedure-derived data."
https://openalex.org/W3207575674,Predictors and Correlates of Perceived Cognitive Decline in Retired Professional Rugby League Players,2021-10-11,2021,article,"Objective: Rugby league is an international full-contact sport, with frequent concussive injuries. Participation in other full-contact sports such as American football has been considered to be a risk factor for neuropsychiatric sequelae later-in-life, but little research has addressed the mental and cognitive health of retired professional rugby league players. We examined predictors and correlates of perceived (self-reported) cognitive decline in retired National Rugby League (NRL) players. Methods: Participants were 133 retired male elite level rugby league players in Australia. Participants completed clinical interviews, neuropsychological testing, and self-report measures. The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, self-report (IQCODE-Self), measured perceived cognitive decline. Results: The median age of the sample was 55.0 (M = 53.1, SD = 13.9, range = 30–89) and the median years of education completed was 12.0 (M = 11.9, SD = 2.6, range = 7–18). The retired players reported a median of 15.0 total lifetime concussions (M = 28.0, SD = 36.6, range = 0–200). The mean IQCODE-Self score was 3.2 (SD = 0.5; Range = 1.3–5.0); 10/133 (7.5%) and 38/133 (28.6%) scored above conservative and liberal cutoffs for cognitive decline on the IQCODE-Self, respectively. Perceived cognitive decline was positively correlated with current depressive symptoms, negatively correlated with years of professional sport exposure and resilience, and unrelated to objective cognition and number of self-reported concussions. A multiple regression model with perceived cognitive decline regressed on age, concussion history, professional rugby league exposure, depression, resilience, objective cognitive functioning, daytime sleepiness, and pain severity showed depression as the only significant predictor. Conclusion: This is the first large study examining subjectively experienced cognitive decline in retired professional rugby league players. Similar to studies from the general population and specialty clinics, no relationship was found between objective cognitive test performance and perceived cognitive decline. Depressive symptoms emerged as the strongest predictor of perceived cognitive decline, suggesting that subjective reports of worsening cognition in retired elite rugby league players might reflect psychological distress rather than current cognitive impairment."

Traditional natural grass pitches are the most prevalent surface at
amateur-level soccer. Environmental considerations such as the climate,
weather, grass coverage and seasonal variations all have an impact on the
natural grass characteristics and affect performance of both player and surface. A
key natural grass pitch variable that may influence the performance
characteristics is the surface hardness. Therefore, the aim of the project was
to examine the influence of natural grass surface hardness on amateur-level
soccer performance and game characteristics via a mixed-method,
multidisciplinary approach. Methods: Four separate studies were carried
out, consisting of one performance analysis case study, two experimental
studies and one focus group. In the first study, one academy-level (amateur)
u-19 soccer player played in eleven competitive matches on soft and hard
natural grass pitches. In the second study, ten academy-level (amateur) College
soccer players completed a repeated sprint protocol of 40-m performed on two
natural grass pitches of contrasting surface hardness. In the third study,
performance, biomechanical and physiological responses were assessed during
steady state running and an 84-minute soccer simulation protocol on soft vs.
hard natural grass pitches. In studies one-to-three surface hardness was
measured using a Clegg Impact Hammer and pitches were categorised into either hard
or soft. In study four, four participants answered nine open-ended questions in
a focus group covering four main areas including the technical, tactical,
physical and psychological concepts of playing and coaching soccer on natural
grass pitches with contrasting surface hardness. Results: In study one
there were more turns on the soft vs. hard pitches (effect size; Cohen’s d)
(i.e., sharp right (d = 1.4; P0.05),
smooth (d = 0.5; P>0.05), V-cut (d = 0.7; P>0.05), moderate intensity (d
= 0.8; P>0.05), and high intensity (d = 0.1; P>0.05)), although there
were slightly more linear turns on hard vs. soft pitches (d = 0.1; P>0.05).
There was a trend for more movements on soft vs. hard pitches (i.e., high
intensity shuffling (d = 1.7; P>0.05), running (d = 1.1; P>0.05), low (d
= 1.1; P>0.05), and high intensity activities (d = 1.2; P>0.05)). In
study two there was a trend for faster repeated sprints (d = 0.6; P>0.05) on
the hard vs. soft pitch (mean ± sd; 6.00 ± 0.42 s vs. 6.22 ± 0.33 s,
respectively). There was a trend for a greater fatigue in sprint performance (d
= 0.8; P>0.05) on the hard pitch vs. soft pitch (mean ± sd; 7.12 ± 2.28 %

A Literature Review,2021-10-09,2021,review,"Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is a common and costly injury in many sports such as the various professional football codes. Most HSIs have been reported to occur during high intensity sprinting actions. This observation has led to the suggestion that a link between sprinting biomechanics and HSIs may exist. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the available scientific evidence underpinning the potential link between sprinting biomechanics and HSIs. A structured search of the literature was completed followed by a risk of bias assessment. A total of eighteen studies were retrieved. Sixteen studies involved retrospective and/or prospective analyses, of which only three were judged to have a low risk of bias. Two other case studies captured data before and after an acute HSI. A range of biomechanical variables have been measured, including ground reaction forces, trunk and lower-limb joint angles, hip and knee joint moments and powers, hamstring muscle–tendon unit stretch, and surface electromyographic activity from various trunk and thigh muscles. Overall, current evidence was unable to provide a clear and nonconflicting perspective on the potential link between sprinting biomechanics and HSIs. Nevertheless, some interesting findings were revealed, which hopefully will stimulate future research on this topic."

A Systematic Review,2021-10-09,2021,review,"The objective of this investigation was to analyze scientific production assessed by indexed doctoral theses in the Ordered Spanish Theses (TESEO) database, on the topic of the sport of handball in Spain. Productivity was analyzed on the basis of variables grouped by contextual information, methodologies and procedures. Seventy-two indexed theses from between 1976 and 2021 were analyzed. A progressive increase was identified in scientific production based on these theses during this period. The scientific disciplines that presented the highest number of theses were Sport Sciences (n = 33) and Sport Pedagogy (n = 19). The main results show that quantitative approaches are the most common (n = 49), doctoral theses using descriptive studies based on systematic observation represent the majority (73%), the predominant type of data collection was the use of cross-sectional studies (70.8%) versus longitudinal studies (26.4%), and the most used sampling method was that of convenience (n = 65). The results make it possible to ascertain the reality of this research topic, the methodological positioning and research tendencies, and to draw the basic lines for development."
https://openalex.org/W3205045674,A Machine Learning Approach to Investigate the Uncertainty of Tissue-Level Injury Metrics for Cerebral Contusion,2021-10-08,2021,article,"Controlled cortical impact (CCI) on porcine brain is often utilized to investigate the pathophysiology and functional outcome of focal traumatic brain injury (TBI), such as cerebral contusion (CC). Using a finite element (FE) model of the porcine brain, the localized brain strain and strain rate resulting from CCI can be computed and compared to the experimentally assessed cortical lesion. This way, tissue-level injury metrics and corresponding thresholds specific for CC can be established. However, the variability and uncertainty associated with the CCI experimental parameters contribute to the uncertainty of the provoked cortical lesion and, in turn, of the predicted injury metrics. Uncertainty quantification via probabilistic methods (Monte Carlo simulation, MCS) requires a large number of FE simulations, which results in a time-consuming process. Following the recent success of machine learning (ML) in TBI biomechanical modeling, we developed an artificial neural network as surrogate of the FE porcine brain model to predict the brain strain and the strain rate in a computationally efficient way. We assessed the effect of several experimental and modeling parameters on four FE-derived CC injury metrics (maximum principal strain, maximum principal strain rate, product of maximum principal strain and strain rate, and maximum shear strain). Next, we compared the in silico brain mechanical response with cortical damage data from in vivo CCI experiments on pig brains to evaluate the predictive performance of the CC injury metrics. Our ML surrogate was capable of rapidly predicting the outcome of the FE porcine brain undergoing CCI. The now computationally efficient MCS showed that depth and velocity of indentation were the most influential parameters for the strain and the strain rate-based injury metrics, respectively. The sensitivity analysis and comparison with the cortical damage experimental data indicate a better performance of maximum principal strain and maximum shear strain as tissue-level injury metrics for CC. These results provide guidelines to optimize the design of CCI tests and bring new insights to the understanding of the mechanical response of brain tissue to focal traumatic brain injury. Our findings also highlight the potential of using ML for computationally efficient TBI biomechanics investigations."

MMA, boxing, kickboxing, and Muay Thai athletes exposed (AE: n = 19; 14 men, 5 women; 30.2 ± 4.5 years; 1.76 ± 0.1 m; 75 ± 9.2 kg) to head impacts were compared to athletes non-exposed (AnE: n = 25; 18 men, 7 women; 25.1 ± 3.2 years; 1.78 ± 0.1 m; 77.4 ± 10.3 kg), and control individuals (CON: n = 23, 13 men, 10 women; 25.5 ± 5.8 years; 1.75 ± 0.1m; 70.4 ± 12 kg). Static balance was assessed using the Balance Error Scoring System, and dynamic function by center of pressure shift and reactive object tracking. A low-cost balance board was used for both protocols. AE performed worse than CON (0.01 ± 0.006 vs 0.006 ± 0.003; P = .02, d = 0.75) in the ellipse area of sway for double-leg stance in firm condition (F2,62 = 3.94, P = .02, η2 = 0.11). Static center of pressure and dynamic balance did not differ among groups. The integration of a balance board and a widely used clinical protocol unveiled differences in the ellipse area of static postural sway in the double-leg stance over a firm surface in athletes chronically exposed to head impacts. The combined use of practical, objective, and clinically relevant test protocols is encouraged to detect lasting deficits in static and dynamic balance as a result of chronic exposure to repetitive head impacts."

However, there is little consensus on which factors have the major associations with LLP. Objective Examine, analyze and summarize the scientific evidence on the factors associated with the performance of LLP in children and adolescents of both sexes aged between 7 and 17 years. Design This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement and was registered in PROSPERO. Data sources A systematic literature search of five electronic databases (i.e., SPORTDiscus, PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS) with date restrictions was conducted (2010 to 2021). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligibility criteria included (i) a study published between 2010 and 2021; (ii) a research study with observational design; (iii) a study analyzing LLP; and (iv) a sample composed of young people between 7 and 17 years old (regardless of sex). Analyses Literature analysis was carried out in English and Portuguese between 2018 and 2021, “blindly” by two researchers. For data sorting, Rayyan® was used. Data extraction and evidence analysis were performed “blindly”, using the Loney scale. The minimum items for observational studies were analyzed by the STROBE checklist. Meta-analyses were conducted based on age group (Childhood [7 to 11 Yrs] and Adolescence [12 to 17 Yrs]) and puberty stages (i.e., Prepupertal and Pubertal). The heterogeneity between the samples of the studies was assessed using the “Cochran’s Q” and “I^2” statistics. Meta-regression analyses were performed to check the factors related to heterogeneity of the studies and to check the associations between chronological age and LLP. Results The literature search resulted in 1,109,650 observational studies of which 39 were included in this review. Through Meta-analysis and Meta-regressions, it was possible to indicate that advancing chronological age related to increased LLP (p&lt;0.01), and that in relation to puberty stages pubertal subjects had higher LLP than their pre-pubertal peers (p&lt;0.01). Discussion The main findings of the present systematic review suggest that as chronological age advances (childhood to adolescence), neuromuscular systems mature and this may be due to advancing puberty, which is also associated with an increase in LLP. Conclusion The factors associated with lower limbs performance are still inconsistent in the literature. However, advancing chronological age and stage of puberty are both associated with increased lower limbs performance. Trial registration ID-PROSPERO- CRD42020137925 ."

In this study, 19 subjects were selected, including 11 males and 8 females. There were seven cases of the left knee and 12 cases of the right knee; all patients had sports injuries. The anatomical structure of a patient’s knee was transformed into a three-dimensional model using finite-element analysis software for segmentation. The models of the tibial plateau and lateral femoral condyle were retained. The results showed that the Lysholm score difference (D) between 6 months after surgery and 1 day before surgery was used as the dependent variable in the three-dimensional finite-element model of knee joint established by the software. Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed, and the difference <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mfenced open=""("" close="")"" separators=""|""> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </mrow> </mfenced> </math> was statistically significant.

Methods: Using a randomised cross over design, 15 recreationally-active males performed 2x10-minute steady-state runs followed by a 10-minute passive recovery with concomitant monitoring of oxygen consumption (V̇O 2 ), heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE; exercise portion only), wearing either the resistance garment (experimental) or running shorts (control). Results: During exercise, V̇O 2 and RPE were higher (4.5% and 7.7% respectively) in experimental than control (V̇O 2 : r =0.24, p &gt;0.05; RPE: r =0.32, p &gt;0.05) whilst HR was lower (-0.4%, r =-0.05, p &gt;0.05).

https://openalex.org/W3203949328,Deficit in knee extension strength following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is explained by a reduced neural drive to the vasti muscles,2021-10-04,2021,article,"The persistence of quadriceps weakness represents a major concern following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The underlying adaptations occurring in the activity of spinal motoneurons are still unexplored. This study examined the discharge patterns of large populations of motor units (MUs) in the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis muscles following ACLR. Nine ACLR individuals and 10 controls performed unilateral trapezoidal contractions of the knee extensor muscles at 35%, 50% and 70% of the maximal voluntary isometric force (MVIF). High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was used to record the myoelectrical activity of the vasti muscles in both limbs. HDsEMG signals were decomposed with a convolutive blind source separation method and MU properties were extracted and compared between sides and groups. The ACLR group showed a lower MVIF on the reconstructed side compared to the contralateral side (28.1%; P < 0.001). This force deficit was accompanied by reduced MU discharge rates (∼21%; P < 0.05), lower absolute MU recruitment and derecruitment thresholds (∼22% and ∼22.5%, respectively; P < 0.05) and lower input-output gain of motoneurons (27.3%; P = 0.009). Deficits in MU discharge rates of the VL and in absolute recruitment and derecruitment thresholds of both vasti MUs were associated with deficits in MVIF (P < 0.05). A strong between-side correlation was found for MU discharge rates of the VL of ACLR individuals (P < 0.01). There were no significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). These results indicate that mid- to long-term strength deficits following ACLR may be attributable to a reduced neural drive to vasti muscles, with potential changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. KEY POINTS: Impaired expression and control of knee extension forces is common after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and is related to high risk of a second injury. To provide novel insights into the neural basis of this impairment, the discharge patterns of motor units in the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis were investigated during voluntary force contractions. There was lower knee extensor strength on the reconstructed side with respect to the contralateral side, which was explained by deficits in motor unit discharge rate and an altered motoneuronal input-output gain. Insufficient excitatory inputs to motoneurons and increased inhibitory afferent signals potentially contributed to these alterations. These results further our understanding of the neural underpinnings of quadriceps weakness following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and can help to develop effective rehabilitation protocols to regain muscle strength and reduce the risk of a second injury."

We asked them to report all health problems they had experienced in the preceding 7 days, irrespective of their consequences on their sports participation or performance and whether they had sought medical attention.Between 2011 and 2020, 94 candidate athletes were included in this monitoring programme and prepared to represent Norway; of these, 66 (71%) were finally selected for multiple Paralympic Games. The overall response rate to the weekly questionnaires was 87%. At any given time during the five observation cycles, 37% of the athletes (95% CI 36% to 38%) reported having at least one health problem. Athletes with neurological impairments (n=51) lost 10 days per year due to respiratory problems (95% CI 9 to 11) compared with 9 days (8-10) among those with musculoskeletal impairments (n=37). Gastrointestinal problems caused a time loss of on average 4 days per year in athletes with neurological impairments versus 1 day in athletes with musculoskeletal impairments (mean difference 2.7 days, 2.1-3.3). Musculoskeletal injuries generated a high burden for both athlete groups, in particular, to the elbow, shoulder and lumbosacral regions.At any given time, nearly two out of five elite Norwegian Para athletes reported at least one health problem. Respiratory tract and other infections; gastrointestinal problems, injuries to the shoulder, elbow and lumbosacral regions represented the greatest health burden.

The sample comprised 440 female Brazilian runners, who answered an online questionnaire, that provided information regarding height, weight, age (categories: ""young adult"", ""adult"", ""early middle-age"", and ""older adults""), socioeconomic status, and training characteristics (frequency and volume per week, running pace, race event, and running club participation). Information about environmental variables was obtained from the official institutes and comprised the human development index (HDI), athletics events, athletic tracks, and female homicide. A linear regression model, clustered by state and performed by age groups, was computed. The sample presented a mean running pace of 5:57min/km, and a mean BMI of 23.51kg/m-2. An increase in running pace and volume/week was observed with increasing age. In ""young adults"", any of the variables were significantly associated with the performance. In ""adult"" group, only individual characteristics were statistically significantly related with the performance. In ""early middle-age"", besides BMI (β=5.72; 95%CI=3.65-7.79) and training volume (β=-0.67; 95%CI=-1.07 - -0.27), the HDI was associated with the performance (β=-23.30; 95%CI=-44.11 - -2.49). In older adults, it was found an association between socioeconomic status (β=-19.47; 95%CI=-32.29 - -6.65), practice time (β=142.92; 95%CI=89.34-196.50), running event participation (β=-80.12; 95%CI=-114.35- -45.88), athletic events (β=33.44; 95%CI=15.16-51.72), and female homicide (β=-0.11; 95%CI=-0.17 - -0.05) with the performance, highlighting the influence of both individual and environmental characteristics. Information about the role of these constraints, and their relationships, in female runners' performance, can be used to guide the development of projects/strategies aiming to increase their involvement in physical activities and sports practice, through the promotion of a more ""friendly environment"" to women, and providing support for decision-makers when suggesting/implementing public policies."

This sex disparity has, in part, been attributed to the differences in reproductive hormone profiles between men and women. Many studies have shown that anterior knee (AK) laxity and the rate of non-contact ACL injuries vary across the menstrual cycle, but these data are inconsistent. Similarly, several studies have investigated the potential protective effect of hormonal contraceptives on non-contact ACL injuries, but their conclusions are also variable. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to, identify, evaluate and summarise the effects of endogenous and exogenous ovarian hormones on AK laxity (primary outcome) and the occurrence of non-contact ACL injuries (secondary outcome) in women. We will perform a systematic search for all observational studies conducted on this topic.

https://openalex.org/W3204875279,"Accuracy of Robotic-Assisted Spinal Surgery—Comparison to TJR Robotics, da Vinci Robotics, and Optoelectronic Laboratory Robotics",2021-10-01,2021,article,"<h3>ABSTRACT</h3> <h3>Background:</h3> The optoelectronic camera source and data interpolation serve as the foundation for navigational integrity in the robotic-assisted surgical platform. The objective of the current systematic review serves to provide a basis for the numerical disparity that exists when comparing the intrinsic accuracy of optoelectronic cameras: accuracy observed in the laboratory setting versus accuracy in the clinical operative environment. It is postulated that there exists a greater number of connections in the optoelectronic kinematic chain when analyzing the clinical operative environment to the laboratory setting. This increase in data interpolation, coupled with intraoperative workflow challenges, reduces the degree of accuracy based on surgical application and to that observed in controlled musculoskeletal kinematic laboratory investigations. <h3>Methods:</h3> Review of the PubMed and Cochrane Library research databases was performed. The exhaustive literature compilation obtained was then vetted to reduce redundancies and categorized into topics of intrinsic optoelectronic accuracy, registration accuracy, musculoskeletal kinematic platforms, and clinical operative platforms. <h3>Results:</h3> A total of 147 references make up the basis for the current analysis. Regardless of application, the common denominators affecting overall optoelectronic accuracy are intrinsic accuracy, registration accuracy, and application accuracy. Intrinsic accuracy of optoelectronic tracking equaled or was less than 0.1 mm of translation and 0.1° of rotation per fiducial. Controlled laboratory platforms reported 0.1 to 0.5 mm of translation and 0.1°–1.0° of rotation per array. There is a huge falloff in clinical applications: accuracy in robotic-assisted spinal surgery reported 1.5 to 6.0 mm of translation and 1.5° to 5.0° of rotation when comparing planned to final implant position. Total Joint Robotics and da Vinci urologic robotics computed accuracy, as predicted, lies between these two extremes—1.02 mm for da Vinci and 2 mm for MAKO. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> Navigational integrity and maintenance of fidelity of optoelectronic data is the cornerstone of robotic-assisted spinal surgery. Transitioning from controlled laboratory to clinical operative environments requires an increased number of steps in the optoelectronic kinematic chain and error potential. Diligence in planning, fiducial positioning, system registration, and intraoperative workflow have the potential to improve accuracy and decrease disparity between planned and final implant position. The key determining factors limiting navigation resolution accuracy are highlighted by this Cochrane research analysis."

Biomechanics are commonly considered in the prevention and rehabilitation of PCI by performance staff. However, there is no documented testing method to assess for associations between biomechanics and PCI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between an easily applicable, novel biomechanical assessment tool and PCI.Fifty male elite-level rugby union athletes (age 22.83±5.08) participating in the highest tier of England were tested at the start of the 2019 preseason period and PCIs (N=48) were recorded over the 2019/2020 playing season. Participants' biomechanics were analysed using two-dimensional video analysis against an injury risk score (IRS) system in the performance of the combined movement-prone hip extension and knee flexion. Participants' biomechanics in carrying out this movement were scored against the 10-point IRS, where the more compensatory movement recorded sees an increase in an individual's IRS. Participants' IRS was then compared against the number of PCIs sustained and Spearman's correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis.There is a significant association between IRS and PCI (R=0.542, p<0.001). Linear regression demonstrated that an increase in 1 in IRS was associated with a 35% increase in PCI incidence (R²=0.346).A significance between the IRS and PCI provides preliminary support for its use as an injury risk assessment tool."

Materials and methods. The indices of heart rate variability (HRV), central hemodynamics (CH) and physical development (PD) were studied in 44 female swimmers (mean age 15.00 ± 0.36 years, swimming experience – 7.40 ± 0.35 years) depending on their sports qualifications (MSIC, MS, CMS, first- and second-class athletes). To analyze the autonomic regulation of cardiac activity, power spectral and time-domain indices of HRV were used. CH were examined by the method of automated tetrapolar rheography according to W. Kubiček et al. (1970) in Y. T. Pushkar’s et al. modification (1970). Physical working capacity was measured according to the generally accepted technique on a cycling ergometer using the PWC170 submaximal test. The functional state index (FSI) was calculated using the formula patented by authors. Results. Significant differences were found between the indices of HRV, CH and PD in female swimmers with different qualifications. Thus, in the athletes with the MSIC–MS sports qualifications, heart rate was 61.0 ± 3.8 bpm, cardiac index (CI) – 2.978 ± 0.098 L·min-1·m-2 (there was a trend towards the eukinetic type of hemodynamics (TH)), stress index (SI) – 51.16 ± 12.66 relative units (r.u.), PWC170/kg – 16.98 ± 1.22 kgm·min-1·kg-1, FSI – 6.511 ± 0.422 r.u. A decrease in heart rate among them was correlated with a decrease in SI, and an increase in Mo – with a decrease in CI. In female CMS swimmers, heart rate was 61.37 ± 2.83 beats/min-1, CI – 3.021 ± 0.112 l -1min -1·m -2 , a trend towards the predominantly eukinetic TH, SI – 53.73 ± 9.41 r.u., PWC170 /kg– 14.66 ± 0.683 kgm·min-1·kg -1, FSI – 5.683 ± 0.324 r.u. Reduced values of SI and CI were associated with increased values of Mo and PWC170/kg. In first- and second-class female swimmers, heart rate was 63.05 ± 2.22 beats/min, SI – 50.62 ± 6.4 r.u. This group tended to be eytonic and eukinetic. The mean value of the PWC170/kg was 14.19 ± 0.589 kgm·min-1·kg-1 and FSI – 5.953 ± 0.337 r.u. Correlation analysis confirmed the relationship between the decrease in heart rate and CI and the increase in Mo and PWC170/kg. Conclusions.

Experiment 1 examined 17 male recreational runners with patellofemoral pain, in semi-custom insole and no-insole conditions. Experiment 2 examined 13 male recreational athletes with patellofemoral pain, undertaking run, [Formula: see text] cut and single-leg hop movements in knee sleeve and no-sleeve conditions. In both experiments, motion capture and ground reaction forces were collected, allowing kinetics and three-dimensional kinematics to be calculated alongside patellofemoral joint loading quantified using musculoskeletal modeling. In both experiments, patellofemoral pain symptoms were examined using the KOOS patellofemoral pain subscale and psychological wellbeing using the COOP-WONCA questionnaire. The findings from both experiments showed that pain symptoms significantly predicted psychological wellbeing ([Formula: see text] in experiment 1 and [Formula: see text] in experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that orthoses significantly reduced tibial internal rotation range of motion (no-[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) whilst also increasing the peak knee adduction moment (no-[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]N[Formula: see text]m/kg and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]N[Formula: see text]m/kg).

Grade I–II injuries are treated conservatively, without surgery, leading to satisfactory results and a return to sporting activity in most cases. The treatment of grade III injuries is controversial. However, surgical treatment is recommended for high grade 4 to 6. Appreciation of anatomical structures that provide the acromioclavicular joints stability is vital for successful and sustainable treatment. Method and Material: 11 patients (8 males and 3 females) who had high grade acromioclavicular joint injury were operated from July 2019 to January 2020. All patients were assessed clinically, radiologically and classified according to rockwood classification. Patients were selected on basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Coracoclavicular Ligament reconstruction was done using ethibond 5. Post-operative rehabilitation: Post operatively arm sling was given for 6 weeks. Passive range of motion started with pendulum exercise, towel slides, internal and external rotation, scapula protraction, retraction followed by active range of motion wall slides with trunk, bilateral and unilateral pull with trunk rotations, deltotrapezial complex work. Patient returned to his routine work after six month. Results: All the patients were followed up clinically and radiologically. The mean constant score increased from 51.09 preoperatively to 83.81 postoperatively at followup. All the patients had resumed their activity by 6 months postoperatively. No loss of reduction and no complication was observed at follow-up. Discussion: Currently, the 4 main surgical options for AC joint disruptions are (1) AC joint fixation with pins, screws, suture wires, plates, and hook plates, (2) coracoacromial (CA) ligament transfer, (3) C Cinterval fixation, and (4) ligament reconstruction. CC interval fixation has been described with screw fixation, suture loop fixation, end button fixation (flip buttons), and suture anchors. Our study reviewed 11 patients (8 males and 3 females) with a complete CC ligament disruption who were each treated with two #5 Ethibond sutures placed through drill holes in the clavicle and looped around the coracoid process. This technique offerded good functional outcomes and no loss of reduction at a minimum follow up of 10 months (average, 11.5 months). At 12 months after surgery, mean constant murley score is 83.5. Conclusion: Techniques that anatomically restore the AC joint and coracoclavicular ligaments have shown to be superior in biomechanical studies. we conclude that high grade acromioclavicular joint injury require surgical fixation for better functional outcome."

Para isso, 16 voluntários pós-acidente vascular encefálico (AVE) - 12 homens e 4 mulheres, com idade média de 56 anos - e 16 hígidos pareados por sexo e idade participaram da coleta experimental, na qual eles foram submetidos ao jogo digital “cabeceio”, que tem cinco níveis de velocidade, do mais lento ao mais rápido, com duração de 30 segundos cada. A partir dos sinais cinemáticos foi possível calcular os indicadores de interesse, a área da base de suporte e a margem de estabilidade, definida como a menor distância entre as bordas da base de suporte e a projeção vertical do centro de massa (CM) extrapolado, que considera a velocidade do CM. Os valores da base de suporte não apresentaram diferenças entre os níveis de velocidade do jogo, mas sim entre grupos. A margem de estabilidade não diferiu entre níveis e grupos. Os níveis de velocidade do jogo, possivelmente, não estimularam os voluntários a buscar estratégias diferentes para manter a estabilidade, como dar um passo, mas os fizeram adotar bases de suporte diferentes, sendo que indivíduos com AVE adotaram uma base de suporte menor do que a dos hígidos."

The main aim of this study was to determine the differences between professional female basketball and handball players in terms of anthropometric features, change of direction speed (CODS), and the RA task. Moreover, the relationships among anthropometric features, agility, and parameters of perception were determined. Two scenarios of the Five-Time Shuttle Run to Gates test (planned and unplanned) were used to evaluate the CODS and RA. The response time (RT) was also measured in the unplanned scenario. Additionally, the index of reactivity (REAC-INDEX) was specified as the difference between the RA test result and the measurement of CODS. There was a significant difference found in terms of body height, with basketball players being taller than handball players (p = 0.032). Professional female handball players achieved better results than professional female basketball players with regard to RA tasks (p = 0.01) and CODS (p = 0.041). Significant simple correlations between each anthropometric feature (body height, body mass) and values for CODS and RA were observed (r = 0.49-0.53). Applying partial correlation allowed for the assessment of actual relationships among CODS, RA, RT, and REAC-INDEX, without a confounding variable. Detaching the anthropometric parameters from the rest of the relationships resulted in maintenance or changes in r-values and an increased significance in the relationships between each pair: RA vs. RT, RA vs. REAC-INDEX, and RT vs. REAC-INDEX. The strongest associations were related to RT vs. REAC-INDEX (r = 0.97 at detaching body height or body mass, p < 0.001) and CODS vs. RA (r = 0.66 at detaching body height and r = -0.67 at detaching body mass, p < 0.001). It is recommended to use partial correlations in subsequent studies, as simple correlations are not reliable and may not reveal the apparent relationships between the variables. In addition, when determining the CODS and RA, it is suggested to take anthropometric and perception variables into account, such as reaction time or REAC-INDEX."

Data sources: Four electronic databases: MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Study selection: All articles were original research and published in English. Studies examined adults with remote exposure to mTBI and/or RHIs from ten or more years ago in addition to any associated neuroimaging findings. Data extraction: Parameters mainly included participants' population, age, years since head injury, race, sex, education level, and any neuroimaging findings. Scores for the level of evidence and risk of bias were calculated independently by two authors. Results: 5,521 studies were reviewed, of which 34 met inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The majority of adults in these studies showed positive neuroimaging findings one or more decades following mTBI/RHI exposure. This was consistent across study populations (i.e., veterans, athletes, and the general population). There was evidence for altered protein deposition patterns, micro- and macro-structural, functional, neurochemical, and blood flow-related differences in the brain for those with remote mTBI/RHI exposure. Conclusion: Findings from these studies suggest that past mTBI/RHI exposure may be associated with neuroimaging findings. However, given the methodological constraints related to relatively small sample sizes and the heterogeneity in injury types/exposure and imaging techniques used, conclusions drawn from this review are limited. Well-designed longitudinal studies with multimodal imaging and in-depth health and demographic information will be required to better understand the potential for having positive neuroimaging findings following remote mTBI/RHI."

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent arthropathy across the world. It presents with swelling, pain, decreased range of motion (ROM) and instability. Patients also complain of thigh muscle weakness and lower limb weakness resulting in poor joint shielding and joint overload. Owing to these presenting features patients are prone to increased risk of morbidity and are forced to live with functional impairment. Exercises are one of the vital intervention programme used in knee OA. Exercises lead to improvement in physical function, strengthening of the muscles and reduction in pain. Neuromuscular exercises have effects on functional performance, biomechanics and activation pattern of surrounding musculatures of the patient. Therefore, neuromuscular exercises may prove to be beneficial in enhancing the efficacy of exercise training programmes in such patients due to functional instability and disturbed neuromuscular function. Purpose. This article intends to review the effect and role of neuromuscular exercises in the management of knee osteoarthritis. Method. Comprehensive computerized search was performed on Google Scholar, Pubmed and Cochrane. Conclusion. By evaluating various articles on neuromuscular exercises in knee osteoarthritis the present review suggest that neuromuscular exercises are helpful in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis."

More than 50 World and European championships are held every year in various sports disciplines. The participation and number of deaf athletes delegated to these sports competitions depend on the budget available to national sports federations (NSFs) of deaf athletes. Many times, NSFs have been forced to withdraw from participation in a competition owing to a lack of financial resources. In numerous countries, NSFs have to conduct online fundraising dedicated to their representatives’ involvement in sports competitions. The authors reviewed the source materials on the internet on financing the sport of the hearing impaired. No scientific articles covering the funding aspect of national sports federations in the world were found. The authors relied on financial documents provided by the NSF (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Spain) and on websites indicated by these federations. The aim of the article was to characterize selected national organizations gathering deaf athletes from Europe, Asia and Oceania, and North America in terms of the budget they had at their disposal in years 2013–2017, the number of athletes associated in the NSF, and the number of Olympic competitors and the country’s medal position during the 2013 and 2017 Deaflympics. An overview of NSF websites with reference to “annual reports”, “financial reports”, “financial statements”, “newsletter”, “national teams of”, “number of athletes of”, demonstrated numerous deficiencies in the transparent presentation of the financial situation of NSFs. The content of NSF activity reports also provides limited information on the number of athletes and clubs associated in these federations.

Reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament in the anatomical position using autologous tendons is a recent surgical trend. This study is to report clinical and radiologic results of reconstruction of the CC ligament using an autologous palmaris longus tendon interweaved with Mersilene tape (PLMT) with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Methods This retrospective study analyzed 76 patients (mean age, 43.4 ± 11.2 years) with AC joint dislocation treated by reconstruction of the CC ligament with PLMT, from March 2004 to February 2017. The mean follow-up period was 28 ± 6.7 months (range, 24–66 months). The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain assessment, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons rating scale (ASES), and Constant Score (CS) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes at the final follow-up. CC and AC distances were measured using anteroposterior (AP) X-ray preoperatively, 6 weeks postoperatively, and at the final follow-up for radiologic outcomes. Complications were also assessed. Results The mean preoperative VAS, ASES, CS were 5.7 ± 0.7, 77.1 ± 6.2, and 61.5 ± 5.2, respectively. These scores at the last follow-up improved to 2.1 ± 0.5, 90.9 ± 4.3, and 94 ± 7.0, respectively ( p = 0.043, p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001). The mean preoperative CC and AC distances were 16.49 ± 3.73 mm and 13.84 ± 3.98 mm, respectively. They were 7.16 ± 1.22 mm and 3.86 ± 2.34 mm at 6 weeks postoperative, and became 9.29 ± 2.72 mm and 5.30 ± 2.09 mm at the final follow-up. The mean CC and AC distances decreased significantly at the final follow-up ( p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001). Although a slight re-widening of the CC distance occurred in 10 patients (13.1%), most patients regained full range of motion of the affected shoulder at the final follow-up. Conclusion The CC ligament reconstruction with PLMT for the treatment of AC joint dislocation showed good clinical and radiological results. This technique could be a good alternative treatment for AC dislocations."

https://openalex.org/W3202010646,Tidal marsh dynamics in a changing climate A study on the mechanisms of pioneer establishment and erosion,2021-09-29,2021,dissertation,"Tidal marshes often present cyclic dynamics, with alternating phases of expansion and lateral retreat. Marsh seedling establishment is a primary condition for marsh colonization and expansion. Successful establishment is often episodic due to bio-physical thresholds, as expressed in the ‘Windows of Opportunity’ concept. Identifying critical factors and understanding how they ... read more enable or hamper seedling establishment, is highly relevant for coastal management and restoration schemes. This study quantified the effects of critical factors in tidal marsh establishment processes. Firstly, by exposing marsh seedlings to different disturbances in terms of sedimentation regime and wave exposure, this study found that these disturbances affect seedling establishment both directly and via bio-morphological adjustments (Chapter 2 and 3). Secondly, channel related drainage relief was found to facilitate seedling survival, especially in the early phase of marsh establishment in muddy systems (Chapter 4). Thirdly, by using marsh seedlings with different disturbance-free periods in both laboratory and field experiments, this study confirmed that a longer disturbance-free period can strongly enhance seedling survival as well as their resistance to later extreme disturbances (Chapter 2 and 4). The erosion of tidal marshes often leads to the development of a cliff at the boundary between tidal flat and marsh. The formation of a cliff shifts marsh development from a phase of lateral expansion to a retreating phase, as a result of the interdependent feedbacks between marsh vegetation and external forcing. This thesis investigated the tipping point conditions of cliff formation at marsh edges with different marsh species. The clonal growth of vegetation at marsh edges was found to respond to different sediment types and to affect the cliff formation processes. Species-specific clonal growth strategies in step length have important effects on initiating cliffs, lateral retreat and thus landscape dynamics at marsh edges (Chapter 5). In summary, this study provides mechanistic insight into the primary expansion (i.e., seedling establishment) of tidal marshes under a variety of critical forcing factors, as well as insight in the factors contributing to cliff formation and the onset of lateral retreat. It highlights the variability in relevant species-specific responses, as well as the importance of location-dependent factors. These results add quantitative support to models predicting the critical transitions in marsh dynamics, both marsh expansion and marsh retreat. The findings of this study are instructive for marsh restoration and nature based coastal defense schemes. While they contribute to understanding the overall stability of marsh ecosystems in the face of global change, they also highlight the need for tailor-made solutions for the application of nature-based solutions at particular locations. show less"
https://openalex.org/W3202886506,Perspective: Challenges Presented for Regeneration of Heterogeneous Musculoskeletal Tissues that Normally Develop in Unique Biomechanical Environments,2021-09-28,2021,review,"Perspective: Musculoskeletal (MSK) tissues such as articular cartilage, menisci, tendons, and ligaments are often injured throughout life as a consequence of accidents. Joints can also become compromised due to the presence of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, there is a need to develop regenerative approaches to address such injuries to heterogeneous tissues and ones that occur in heterogeneous environments. Such injuries can compromise both the biomechanical integrity and functional capability of these tissues. Thus, there are several challenges to overcome in order to enhance success of efforts to repair and regenerate damaged MSK tissues. Challenges: 1. MSK tissues arise during development in very different biological and biomechanical environments. These early tissues serve as a template to address the biomechanical requirements evolving during growth and maturation towards skeletal maturity. Many of these tissues are heterogeneous and have transition points in their matrix. The heterogeneity of environments thus presents a challenge to replicate with regard to both the cells and the ECM. 2. Growth and maturation of musculoskeletal tissues occurs in the presence of anabolic mediators such as growth hormone and the IGF-1 family of proteins which decline with age and are low when there is a greater need for the repair and regeneration of injured or damaged tissues with advancing age. Thus, there is the challenge of re-creating an anabolic environment to enhance incorporation of implanted constructs. 3. The environments associated with injury or chronic degeneration of tissues are often catabolic or inflammatory. Thus, there is the challenge of creating a more favorable in vivo environment to facilitate the successful implantation of in vitro engineered constructs to regenerate damaged tissues. Conclusions: The goal of regenerating MSK tissues has to be to meet not only the biological requirements (components and structure) but also the heterogeneity of function (biomechanics) in vivo. Furthermore, for many of these tissues, the regenerative approach has to overcome the site of injury being influenced by catabolism/inflammation. Attempts to date using both endogenous cells, exogenous cells and scaffolds of various types have been limited in achieving long term outcomes, but progress is being made."

Nineteen high-level senior and professional soccer players (age: 23.2 ± 3.1 years; height: 181 ± 0.06 cm; body mass: 75.2 ± 4.8 kg) performed several common screening tests during preseason: Dorsiflexion lunge test (DLT); bent knee fall out test (BKFO); y-balance anterior test (YBT A); y-balance posterolateral test (YBT PL); Y-balance posteromedial test (YBT PM); Heel-rise test (HRT) and single leg hamstring bridge test (SLHBT). High levels of reliability (ICC &gt; 0.88 and &lt;0.94) were observed in all the studied variables. Inter-limb significant differences were observed in DLT and YBT PM test (p &lt; 0.01) but YBT A, HRT and SLHBT presented trivial effect size (ES) (0.03; 0.07 and 0.13, respectively), contrary to DLT, BKFO and YBT PL, all with small ES (0.20; −0.23 and −0.22) and YBT PM, which revealed very large ES (2.91). Considering all data, high-level senior and professional soccer players present fairly good mean values of lower limb symmetry. Performance considering all tests was different, a fact associated with different biomechanical dynamics (e.g., YBT), nonetheless, the correlations between tests underline the relationship between these, which could represent important evidence to consider for injury prevention and performance enhancement programs."

Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial meniscus (MM) can contribute to the development of knee OA, but their relationship to its time of onset is unknown.Purpose: To analyze the factors contributing to early knee OA changes in ACL injured knees using MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS). Methods: Thirty-four cases status post unilateral ACL reconstruction (ACLR) were included. Knee OA abnormalities were evaluated using MOAKS scores of MRIs performed pre- and post-ACLR. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the MOAKS scores of medial osteophytes, medial cartilage alteration, and patellofemoral cartilage alteration were determined as dependent variables. Age, the presence of a meniscal abnormality, the time from injury to ACLR, and body mass index (BMI) were determined as explanatory variables. MOAKS differences between knees with and without medial meniscus (MM) abnormality were tested for each variable using a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with the factors of preoperative vs. postoperative status and MM abnormality. Results: In the pre-ACLR multiple linear regression analysis, the waiting period was significantly and positively associated with medial cartilage loss, Lateral femorotibial osteophytes, lateral cartilage loss. and BMI were positively associated with MM abnormalities. BMI and lateral meniscus (LM) abnormality were significantly associated with lateral cartilage loss. Age was significantly associated with medial osteophytes. Age and LM abnormality were significantly associated with lateral osteophytes. Age, BMI, and LM abnormality were significantly associated with patellofemoral osteophytes. Conclusion: We found early knee OA changes in most knees a mean of 28.2 ± 52.0 months after ACL injury. The time from injury to ACLR, BMI, and the presence of MM or LM abnormality in the ACL injured knee were associated with early knee OA changes. In the ACL injured knee with MM involvement, prompt ACLR may forestall the development of OA."

We propose the usage of nine squat and four one-leg standing exercise features as input parameters to Machine Learning (ML) classifiers in order to perform lower limb skill assessment. The significance of this approach is that it does not demand manpower and infrastructure, unlike traditional methods. We base the output layer of the classifiers on the Short Test Battery Locomotive Syndrome (STBLS) test used to detect Locomotive Syndrome (LS) approved by the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA). We obtained three assessment scores by using this test, namely sit-stand, 2-stride, and Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25). We tested two ML methods, namely an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) comprised of two hidden layers with six nodes per layer configured with Rectified-Linear-Unit (ReLU) activation function and a Random Forest (RF) regressor with number of estimators varied from 5 to 100. We could predict the stand-up and 2-stride scores of the STBLS test with correlation of 0.59 and 0.76 between the real and predicted data, respectively, by using the ANN.

Two musculoskeletal radiologists (designated radiologist A and radiologist B, respectively) evaluated the images. Nerve injury was classified as neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or neurotmesis. Signal strength was measured at the CPN, the tibial nerve (TN), and a superficial vein (SV). The CPN/TN and CPN/SV signal ratios were calculated. The status of each PLC structure, including the popliteal tendon, arcuate ligament, lateral collateral ligament, and biceps tendon, was classified as normal, partially torn, or completely torn, as was that of the cruciate ligaments. For the semiquantitative analysis of interobserver agreement, the kappa statistic was calculated, whereas a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used for the quantitative analysis.In the patient group, radiologist A found CPN abnormalities in 15 cases (39.4%)-neurapraxia in eight and axonotmesis in seven-whereas radiologist B found CPN abnormalities in 14 (36.8%)-neurapraxia in nine and axonotmesis in five. The kappa statistic showed excellent interobserver agreement. In the control group, the CPN/TN signal ratio ranged from 0.63 to 1.1 and the CPN/SV signal ratio ranged from 0.16 to 0.41, compared with 1.30-4.02 and 0.27-1.08, respectively, in the patient group. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the CPN/TN signal ratio at a cutoff value of 1.39 had high (93.3%) specificity for the identification of nerve damage, compared with 81.3% for the CPN/SV signal ratio at a cutoff value of 0.41.CPN alterations are common in patients with PLC injury detected on MRI, and the level of interobserver agreement for such alterations was excellent. Calculating the CPN/TN and CPN/SV signal ratios may increase diagnostic confidence.

The current study aimed to share lessons learnt from utilizing an online survey as a novel approach to development of a CAT. The application domain was sport, specifically football goalkeeping. A secondary aim was to apply the CAT to the goalkeeping role and gain the perceptions of both goalkeeping coaches and players on the functions and situations specific to a goalkeeper during match‐play. Methods Ten SMEs with high‐level expertize in goalkeeping coaching and/or playing participated in an online survey including a series of demographic, Likert scale and open‐ended questions regarding goalkeeper specific functions and match‐play situations. Eight goalkeeper match‐play situations and 18 specific functions were included. Results A CAT model was created demonstrating the match‐play situations where specific goalkeeper functions occur. Three function groupings were identified: broad (six or more functions), moderate (between three and five functions), and specific (below three functions). Discussion Utilizing online surveys to develop a CAT model is a novel approach within the Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) literature. Further, the CAT represents a first of its kind analysis in the football performance literature. Strengths and limitations of using online surveys for the development of a CAT are discussed. In conclusion, the work suggests flexible approaches can be used to develop HFE models."

We further compared the improvement rate of women vs. men of the top-10 ranked athletes in the IAAF running these middle-distance events Method The top 10 athletes in the IAAF ranking of 800 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m events for each sex were assessed for their history of race times before achieving their personal record (PR). The difference between PR (‘actual’ season) and the best race time in the last season was defined as the 1st season improvement rate (1-SIR), whereas the average improvement rate in the last and preceding seasons was the multi-season improvement rate (M-SIR). 1-SIR and M-SIR were calculated for each athlete. Result There were sex differences in the 1500 m with a large effect size ( d = − 0.746) in 1-SIR ( P = 0.001) and very large ( d = − 2.249) in M-SIR ( P = 0.001). Women improved more than men before the PR/WR achievements in the 800 m and 1500 m events ( P = 0.001) and had similar improvement rates before performing PR/WR in 3000 m events ( P = 0.533). Conclusion Women improve more before PR/WR achievement in 800 m and 1500 m races. However, in the 3000 m men and women have similar improvement rates in previous seasons before the PR/WR achievement."

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND UPDATE,2021-09-27,2021,article,"ABSTRACT The presence of abnormalities in knee alignment (genu varum and genu valgum) is extremely common in soccer. It can occur in the junior league / youth academy and perpetuate itself throughout the professional career. The consequences of years of high-level sports practice in players with genu varum / genu valgum can be harmful to the knees. By observing football matches of the present and the past, the authors of the article noted that great Brazilian soccer players were, or are, affected by the malalignment of the knees: Garrincha (the most famous), Leandro, Dunga, Romário, Rivaldo and Neymar. This study aims to discuss the relationship between high-performance sport and the development of these orthopedic deformities, serving as a tool for updating the trauma-orthopedic knee subspecialty. Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study."

Secondarily, we explored the relationship between kinetic measurement system findings and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods We followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews and Arksey and O’Malley’s 6-stage framework. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to June 2020. Original research papers reporting parameters measured by kinetic measurement systems in individuals at least 6-months post primary ACLR were included. Results In 158 included studies, 7 kinetic measurement systems (force plates, balance platforms, pressure mats, force-measuring treadmills, Wii balance boards, contact mats connected to jump systems, and single-sensor insoles) were identified 4 main movement categories (landing/jumping, standing balance, gait, and other functional tasks). Substantial heterogeneity was noted in the methods used and outcomes assessed; this review highlighted common methodological reporting gaps for essential items related to movement tasks, kinetic system features, justification and operationalization of selected outcome parameters, participant preparation, and testing protocol details. Accordingly, we suggest considerations for methodological reporting in future research. Only 6 studies included PROMs with inconsistency in the reported parameters and/or PROMs. Conclusion Clear and accurate reporting is vital to facilitate cross-study comparisons and improve the clinical application of kinetic measurement systems after ACLR. Based on the current evidence, we suggest methodological considerations to guide reporting in future research. Future studies are needed to examine potential correlations between kinetic parameters and PROMs."
https://openalex.org/W3202044993,Hamstrung: Do Sex Differences in Hamstring Injury Profile Necessitate a Different Approach to Rehabilitation and Prevention Programs in Female Athletes?,2021-09-26,2021,article,"Hamstring strain injury (HSI) is one of the most common injuries encountered in running sports and can lead to significant morbidity, with time lost from participation and high rates of recurrence. Though the incidence is high in both sexes, male athletes appear to have a two to four-fold greater risk of HSI compared to female athletes, with a longer recovery. Multiple potential risk factors have been studied and age, history of hamstring injury, ACL injury and calf injury appear to be the most significant factors in predicting index injury and recurrence. Female athletes may be relatively protected by less hamstring unit stiffness and greater muscle endurance. Other potential sex-influenced risk factors including differences in pelvic, hip and knee structural morphology and limb alignment, musculotendinous flexibility and joint mobility, and kinetic chain (primary posterior) strength imbalances require further investigation. Further research focusing both exclusively on female athlete as well as more robust comparative studies with male athletes will help us to better understand differences in HSI profile. Future investigation is necessary to determine whether a sex-specific approach to HSI rehabilitation and prevention programs will optimize clinical care for both male and female athletes."

This research is a quasi-experimental design, with the research subjects of POPDA Sleman athletic athletes with sample of 20 people. The sample was divided by matching pairs with the aim of both groups getting a balanced power. The treatments used are sports massage with movement manipulation (effleurage, tapotement, shaking/vibration) and swedish massage with movement manipulation (drainage, compression, tapotement, shaking/vibration) with pressure variation. The results showed that there were differences in the effect/good response of the type of sports massage treatment (group x) with moderate pressure. This is evidenced by the results of an increase in record time by an average of 0.36 seconds. Treatment of light pressure increased record time by an average of 0.28 seconds. Heavy pressure treatment increased record time by an average of 0.04 seconds. There is a difference in the effect/unfavorable response of the type of swedih massage treatment (group y) with all types of pressure, because it provides a decreased response time from pretest to posttest. It is proven by the decrease in the average time of 0.16 seconds on the light pressure treatment, the decrease in the average time of 0.24 seconds on the medium pressure treatment, and a decrease of 0.34 seconds on the heavy pressure treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3199981635,A Retrospective Study of Foot Biomechanics and Injury History in Varsity Football Athletes at the U.S. Naval Academy,2021-09-24,2021,article,"The six-item Foot Posture Index (FPI-6) was previously developed as an assessment tool to measure the posture of the foot across multiple segments and planes. It was derived from a criterion-based observational assessment of six components of each foot during static standing. The association between abnormal foot posture and musculoskeletal injuries remains unclear and is in of need further exploration.The purpose of this study was to assess the association between foot biomechanics and self-reported history of musculoskeletal pain or injury.Retrospective, cross-sectional study of collegiate football players at the U.S. Naval Academy.For each athlete, data were recorded on height, weight, self-reported history of pain or injury, and foot posture, which was measured using a FPI-6 with each item measuring the degree of pronation/supination. The primary outcome was each athlete's maximum deviation from neutral posture across the six-item index (FPImax). The prespecified primary analysis used generalized linear models to measure the association between FPImax and self-report history of pain or injury. Exploratory analyses measured the association using penalized regression (L1-norm) and a type of tree-based ensemble known as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).Data were collected on 101 athletes, 99 of whom had sufficient body mass index (BMI) data to be included for analysis. Among the 99 athletes, higher FPImax was associated with a prior history of musculoskeletal pain (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.35), although the sample size was too small for the association to be significant with 95% CI (P = .107). FPImax was not associated with a history of knee injury/pain (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15, P = .792), nor with a history of ankle/foot injury or pain (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21, P = .599). From the L1-penalized model, the FPI components with the strongest linear associations were the L6, R2, R1-squared, and FPImax. From the XGBoost model, the most important variables were FPItotal, BMI, R1, and R2.The U.S. Naval Academy football players whose foot postures deviated from neutral were more likely to have reported a previous history of musculoskeletal pain. However, this deviation from normal was not strongly associated with a specific history of pain or injury to the knee, ankle, or foot.The information ascertained from this study could be used to better inform clinicians about the value of the FPI in predicting or mitigating injuries for varsity football athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3200236633,Understanding risk factors for disordered eating symptomatology in athletes: A prospective study,2021-09-24,2021,article,"Disordered eating and eating disorders have huge impact on athletic health and performance. Understanding risk factors for disordered eating development is paramount to protecting the health and performance of these athletes. This project tested a model longitudinally to test whether body dissatisfaction (mediated by negative affect) and societal pressures (mediated by internalisation) predicted bulimic symptomatology at 1 year. The study recruited 1017 male and female athletes in a range of sports at three time points over a year. Cross-lag meditation modelling in MPLUS was utilised to test the hypothesised model. Results indicated that societal pressures mediated by general internalisation led to bulimic symptomatology and that gender and sport type do moderate the relationships. However, measurement issues indicate that scales not originally created for athletes may not reliably measure athletes’ experience. This research highlights how understanding how to better assess risk factors and disordered eating related concepts in athletes is a key next step. The study is unique in its longitudinal design and in its sampling of a wide range of sports in both male and female athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3202746700,Stroke and Athletes: A Scoping Review,2021-09-24,2021,review,"Stroke (i.e., cerebrovascular accident) affects one in 10,000 people between the ages of 14 and 45; however, very little is known about the frequency and type of stroke that occurs in athletes. The risk of injury to the neurovascular structures may depend on the type of sport involvement, although, sport-specific incidence rates are not known. Therefore, the goal of our scoping review was to provide some guidance to better inform the development of a context-fit stroke model by summarizing studies on a broad research topic related to stroke or cerebrovascular accident in sport based on a strict athlete definition. We used the guidance of Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage-process for a scoping review. Databases included MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non- Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R), and Embase (OVID databases); CINAHL Plus with Full Text, SportDiscus with Full Text (Ebsco databases); and Scopus. Publication dates were from 1979-2020 across nine different countries resulting in 39 individual cases of stroke with an athlete age range of 14-56 years (95% male). The major inciting event(s) prior to stroke onset were headaches (38.4%), head trauma (30.7%), and neck injury and/or vertebral artery dissection (20.5%). Several sporting activities were represented with American football as the most prevalent (30.7%). In summary, we found that sports with an aspect of impact, collision, or microtrauma can lead to subsequent stroke. These sport-related traumatic events were often difficult to diagnose because of the longer interval before ischemia occurred. Therefore, health care providers should be particularly attuned to the possibility of stroke when evaluating athletes presenting with or without neurological deficit."

Case report,2021-09-24,2021,article,"Anatomical variations of the attachment of medial meniscus are a common finding. However, anomalies of the posterior horn are extremely rare. Only two cases of posterior root anomaly have been described prior to the routine use of arthroscopy for evaluation and treatment of meniscal pathology. In this report, we present an anomaly of both the anterior and posterior roots of the medial meniscus that posed both a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.The patient is young male soccer player who is currently 16 years of age and began having the atraumatic onset of pain and symptoms that limited performance starting at age 14 and was referred for failure of response to nonoperative treatment. Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed the presence of an anteromedial meniscofemoral ligament whereas the posterior root showed no bony attachment. The radiographic and arthroscopic findings are described. The clinical decision was made after to proceed with observation, reassurance, and gradual return to full activity with physiotherapy guidance.The absence of injury, the mild complaints reported by the patient, his age, skeletal immaturity, and remaining growth led us to adopt a conservative approach to treating this anatomic variant and currently the patient is able to participate fully in sports without symptoms or restrictions."

Therefore, the goal to achieve in this study is to evaluate using a mixed method strategy the behaviors happening in the application of the technical–tactical means performed in the transition play of professional basketball in Spain. An ad hoc observation tool made of 11 criteria and 83 exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories (E/ME) has been designed and validated by means of data quality and generalizability analyses. Indexes obtained show high reliability and validity allowing the proposed actions to be recorded (correlation coefficients are above 0.95 and generalizability coefficients are above 0.90 in all cases). A total number of 128 situations corresponding to eight games of Unicaja de Málaga in the Endesa League in the 18/19 season were observed with the Hoisan software. The analysis of the relationships among behaviors was performed using the polar coordinates technique where the one-on-one initiation, outside the zone, has been used as focal behavior. The estimation of the functions representing the vectors has also been performed to model the best fit that estimates, starting from a focal category, the relationship among this focal behavior and the rest of the mating behaviors for possible future observations. The results show significant relationships between the selected focal behavior and the mating behaviors, showing indications of behaviors allowing tactical interpretation of the game and the definition of intervention programs to improve the performance of the team."

Se consideraron para el análisis las siguientes variables: temperatura cutánea, frecuencia respiratoria, frecuencia cardíaca (FC), porcentaje de frecuencia cardíaca máximo (%FCmáx), postura, actividad y pico de aceleración (ACpico). También se calculó la carga de impulso, expresada en N ∙ s. No se observaron diferencias fisiológicas y mecánicas según la parte del juego, considerando a todos los miembros del equipo arbitral. Se verificaron diferencias significativas entre los árbitros de campo y los árbitros asistentes en la primera y segunda parte y para el total de partido: en promedio, el árbitro de campo mostró valores superiores para temperatura cutánea (p = 0.016; r = -0.759), FC (p = 0.017; r = -0.757), %FCmáx (p = 0.017; r = -0,757), actividad (p = 0,017; r = -0,757) y ACpico (p = 0,017; r = -0,757). Curiosamente, no se encontraron diferencias para la carga de impulso entre el árbitro de campo y los árbitros asistentes. El perfil de actividad del árbitro de fútbol es fisiológica y mecánicamente exigente, incluso en un nivel de sub-élite.

This study aimed to examine the variation in physiological and mechanical load in a sub-elite refereeing team, considering the different parts of the match and their role (field referee vs assistant referees). One field referee (32.57 years) and two assistant referees (31.05 years) were monitored during 4 matches of the Portuguese Championship throughout the 2018-2019 season (senior age category, or adult), using the ZephyrTM BioHarness. The following variables were considered for analysis: skin temperature, respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), percentage of maximum heart rate (%HRmax), posture, activity, and peak acceleration (ACCpeak). The impulse load, expressed as , was also calculated. No physiological and mechanical differences were observed according to match half, considering the refereeing team members. Significant differences were verified between field referee and assistant referees in the 1st half and the 2nd half and for total match-play: on average, the field referee had higher values for skin temperature (p = 0.016; r = -0.759), HR (p = 0.017; r = -0.757), %HRmax (p = 0.017; r = -0.757), activity (p = 0.017; r = -0.757), and ACCpeak (p = 0.017; r = -0.757). Curiously, no differences were found for impulse load between the field referee and the assistant referees. The football referee’s activity profile is both physiologically and mechanically demanding, even at a sub-elite level. Differences between field referee and assistants must be considered in refereeing fitness and conditioning training programs to cope with physical demands of a football match.

Synthetic turf maintenance and athlete health are related and are important considerations at all levels of play. As part of the development of testing practices for the National Football League (NFL) game‐day surfaces, a literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed between the years 1990 and 2018 was conducted. Additionally, a taskforce was convened, and expert opinion was solicited from members through systematic interviews regarding synthetic turf design and maintenance practices in the NFL. All game‐day synthetic turf manufacturers were routinely solicited for input during development and implementation of the mandatory practices. Appropriate maintenance practices can improve the consistency of a synthetic playing surface. Methods for evaluating surface hardness and other aspects of synthetic turf have been developed. The relationships between current hardness testing methods and injury outcomes have been studied but are not well established. Consensus methods for evaluating surface traction and cleat release at potentially injurious loading levels are currently unavailable and needed. Mandatory practices were developed and have been implemented by the NFL, which have resulted in more consistent playing surfaces over the course of a season. Despite the extant gaps in knowledge, a formalized set of testing practices and maintenance has proven effective for reducing surface variability across synthetic surfaces in the NFL. Characteristics such as surface hardness, traction, and shoe–surface interaction, and the effects of surface maintenance procedures should be the focus of future research."
https://openalex.org/W3200738493,Ball heading and subclinical concussion in soccer as a risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament injury,2021-09-19,2021,review,"Abstract Soccer players have a high risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, a potentially career-ending event. ACL rupture has been linked with abnormal neuromuscular control in the lower limb. Additionally, heading the ball with the unprotected head during game play is increasingly recognized as a major source of exposure to concussive and sub-concussive repetitive head impacts. This article provides a hypothesis of potential connection of ACL injury with ball heading in soccer players. The study reviews literature sources regarding the impact of neurocognitive alterations after ball headings in ACL injuries. Poor baseline neurocognitive performance or impairments in neurocognitive performance via sleep deprivation, psychological stress, or concussion can increase the risk for subsequent musculoskeletal injury."

This study investigated the differences in joint angles (including range of motion (ROM)) and forces (including moments) between the left and right limbs at the ankle, knee, and hip joints during dynamic DF and PF movements in both males and females. Using a general linear model employing multivariate analysis in relation to the joint angle, ROM, force, and moment datasets, the results revealed significant main effects for gender, sidedness, phases, and foot position with respect to joint angles. Weak correlations were observed between measured biomechanical variables. These results provide insightful information for clinicians and biomechanists that relate to lower limb exercise interventions and modelling efficacy standpoints."
https://openalex.org/W3201275597,Six methods for classifying lower‐limb dominance are not associated with asymmetries during a change of direction task,2021-09-18,2021,article,"Quantifying asymmetries between dominant and non-dominant limbs is a common research objective aimed at identifying systematic differences between limbs and establishing normative ranges of asymmetry. Multiple methods for classifying limb dominance exist, and it is unclear how different methods relate to directional asymmetries during change of direction (CoD). This study aimed to determine whether different methods of classifying limb dominance, including a novel CoD task-specific method, identified significant inter-limb asymmetries during a 90° CoD task. Fifty participants completed a testing battery consisting of jumping, hopping, CoD, and isokinetic dynamometry. Limb dominance was classified for each participant according to preferred kicking limb, vertical jump height, horizontal hop distance, initial force plate contact during landing, max isokinetic knee extensor strength, and turning velocity. Asymmetries in whole-body and joint-level mechanics were defined using each method. No method for classifying limb dominance was associated with consistent inter-limb biomechanical asymmetries during CoD, and no method was related to any other method. The magnitude of asymmetry relative to the magnitude of absolute asymmetry present within the cohort suggests that using these tasks to classify the dominant limb in this CoD is akin to assigning dominance to a randomly selected limb. Previous observations of group symmetry during CoD may be statistical artifacts as opposed to a true indication of normative movement. Until an appropriate means of classifying limbs during CoD is established, quantifying normative asymmetry based on limb dominance should be done with caution."

Approximately four in five netball athletes will sustain an ankle sprain, up to half will go on to sustain recurrent ankle sprains, and nine in ten report perceived ankle instability. Historically, prevention and management strategies of ankle sprains and injuries have been investigated for a variety of sports, however, no literature reviews have investigated these in netball athletes, or compared these with current best-practice within the literature. Therefore, this scoping review aims to understand how netball athletes currently prevent and manage ankle sprains and to compare these approaches with best-practice recommendations. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases using keywords to capture studies with data or information related to the prevention and management of ankle sprains and injuries in netball. The search strategy captured 982 studies across all databases, with 30 netball studies included in this scoping review. Studies suggest netball athletes are not commonly referred to health professionals, do not undertake adequate rehabilitation, and almost immediately return to court following an ankle sprain or injury. Current best-practices suggest injury prevention programs and external ankle support effectively reduce ankle sprains and injuries; however, poor compliance and implementation may be a significant barrier. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that netball-specific footwear reduces the risk of ankle sprains. The findings suggest netball athletes do not implement current best-practice prevention and management strategies following an ankle sprain. This is despite evidence of the effectiveness of injury prevention programs, external ankle support, and adequate rehabilitation in reducing ankle sprain rates. Current-best practice prevention and management of ankle sprains should be considered by clinicians, coaches, and athletes to reduce the prevalence and chronicity of ankle sprains in netball."
https://openalex.org/W3200849814,Integrating video tracking and GPS to quantify accelerations and decelerations in elite soccer,2021-09-17,2021,article,"The aim of this study was to analyze the degree of agreement comparing number and distance covered in different acceleration and deceleration sections registered by a video tracking system (MEDIACOACH) and a GPS device (WIMU PRO) during official competition. Data from a Spanish professional club were registered over the course of a season. First, the descriptive statistics presented more bursts of accelerations and decelerations in WIMU PRO than in MEDIACOACH, whereas the distances covered recorded by both systems were similar. Second, negative relationships were found (i.e., negative bias) comparing WIMU PRO to MEDIACOACH in the number of accelerations and decelerations between 0/1 m/s2 and ½ m/s2 (p < 0.05), and in the distances covered in accelerations and decelerations (p < 0.05) between 0/1 m/s2 and in accelerations and decelerations registered between 2/3 m/s2 and more than 3 m/s2. Moreover, the differences in means (i.e., standardized mean bias) across the two devices were trivial (> 0.19) and small (0.2-0.59) for most variables. The standardized typical errors in the estimate (TEE) were moderate (0.3-0.59) and small to moderate (0.1-0.29 to 0.3-0.59), respectively. Also, the Intra class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) for agreement and consistency between systems showed good and excellent values (> 0.90). The magnitude of change in means (%) between systems, defined as the percentage change between the numbers or values, was below 14% and 7% for number and distances covered, respectively. All scores in the smallest worthwhile change were lower than 9% and in the coefficients of variation were lower than 95% and 15%, respectively. Thus, both systems demonstrated an acceptable degree of agreement and could be useful in analyzing players' acceleration demands in professional soccer. However, caution is required when interpreting the results and a comparison with a gold standard is required in order to validate both systems."

A total of 239 Danish youth elite soccer players (M = 16.85, SD = 1.09) completed an online questionnaire assessing mental well-being, depression, anxiety, along with other background variables. Female players scored significantly lower on mental well-being and had 4-times higher odds of expressing symptoms of anxiety and depression than males. Athletes’ mental health profiles showed that most athletes experience low depression while having moderate mental well-being. Depression, anxiety, and stress scores generally increased when progressing in age, indicating that the junior-senior transition poses distinct challenges to players’ mental health, especially for female players. Different strategies to foster players’ mental health depending on their mental health profiles are proposed."

The purpose of the present study was to test whether differences in trunk control between males and females during changes of direction exist. Twelve female and 12 male recreational athletes (with at least 10 years of experience in team sport) performed unanticipated changes of direction with 30° and 60° cut angles, while 3D trunk and leg kinematics, ground reaction forces and trunk muscles electromyography were recorded. Trunk kinematics at the time of peak knee abduction moment and directed co-contraction ratios for trunk muscles during the pre-activation and weight acceptance phases were determined. None of the trunk kinematics and co-contraction ratio variables, nor peak knee abduction moment differed between sexes. Compared to the 30° cut, trunk lateral flexion remained unchanged and trunk external rotation was reduced (p < 0.001; η²p (partial eta squared for effect size) = 0.78), while peak knee abduction moment was increased (p < 0.001; η²p = 0.84) at 60°. The sharper cutting angle induced muscle co-contraction during the pre-activation directed less towards trunk flexors (p < 0.01; η²p = 0.27) but more towards trunk medial flexors and rotators opposite to the movement direction (p < 0.001; η²p > 0.46). However, muscle co-contraction during the weight acceptance phase remained comparable between 30° and 60°. The lack of sex-related differences in trunk control does not explain knee joint injury risk discrepancies between sexes during changes of direction. Trunk neuromuscular strategies during sharper cutting angles revealed the importance of external oblique muscles to maintain trunk lateral flexion at the expense of trunk rotation. This provides new information for trunk strength training purposes for athletes performing changes of direction."

Methods Interviews of adults with rheumatologist-diagnosed nr-axSpA and of rheumatologists explored the diagnostic journey and barriers to diagnosis. Emerging themes were further explored in an online patient survey. Patients were recruited through Spondylitis Association of America outreach and patient panels. Results Interviews were conducted with 25 patients (mean age, 45 years; 80% female) and 16 rheumatologists. Survey responses from 186 eligible patients (median age, 40 years; 67% female) were analyzed. Among surveyed patients, median time from symptom onset to nr-axSpA was 3.25 years. In multivariable analysis, delayed diagnosis was significantly more likely for women and people in rural areas. Most patients consulted ≥4 different types of healthcare providers (HCPs) before seeing a rheumatologist and consulted ≥2 rheumatologists before nr-axSpA diagnosis. Identified impediments to timely diagnosis included the insidious onset of bothersome but tolerable chronic pain; episodic rather than persistent symptom patterns that seemed related to activity; symptoms other than chronic lumbosacral back pain that were dominant and required medical consultation; and widespread unfamiliarity with and misperceptions about nr-axSpA among frontline HCPs, radiologists, and rheumatologists. Conclusions Delayed nr-axSpA diagnosis is common and reflects HCP knowledge gaps as well as frequent patient presentation with dominant nonaxial symptoms. Targeted HCP education, further research into early disease patterns, and interventions sensitive to the broader spectrum of nr-axSpA manifestations are needed to improve timely diagnosis.

However, physical characteristics (sagittal spinal alignment and hip joint range of motion [ROM]) associated with LBP have not been clarified. This study seeks to clarify the relationship between physical characteristics and LBP in high school male soccer players. The participants were 90 high school male soccer players. The presence of LBP was evaluated using a questionnaire. We assigned the participants into two groups: the non-LBP group (n = 58) and the LBP group (n = 32). Passive ROM of hip and sagittal spinal alignment were measured. Thoracic kyphotic angle (TKA) was significantly higher in the LBP group than in the non-LBP group, and the ROM of hip joint extension in the nondominant leg was significantly lower in the LBP group than in the non-LBP group. On logistic regression analyses, TKA in the upright position (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.087, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.019–1.159, p < 0.01) and hip extension ROM deficits in the nondominant leg (adjusted OR: 0.888, 95% CI: 0.789–0.999, p < 0.05) were related to LBP in high school male soccer players as determined. This study suggests that hyperkyphosis in the upright position and hip extension ROM deficits in the nondominant leg were related to LBP in high school male soccer players."

Background knowledge of all these essentials helps select the most appropriate regional analgesia technique for knee surgeries."
https://openalex.org/W3201611049,Analysis of Racing Greyhound Path Following Dynamics Using a Tracking System,2021-09-14,2021,article,"The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) has been working closely with the Australasian greyhound industry for more than 5 years to reduce greyhound race-related injuries. During this period, UTS has developed and deployed several different techniques including inertial measurement units, drones, high-frame-rate cameras, track geometric surveys, paw print analysis, track soil spring-force analysis, track maintenance data, race injury data, race computer simulation and modelling to assist in this task. During the period where the UTS recommendations have been adopted, the injury rate has dropped significantly. This has been achieved by animal welfare interventions that lower racing congestion, and lower transient forces and jerk rates the greyhounds experience during a race. This study investigated the use of a greyhound location tracing system where small and lightweight signal emitting devices were placed inside a pocket in the jackets of racing greyhounds. The system deployed an enhanced version of a player tracking system currently used to track the motion of human athletes. Greyhounds gallop at speeds of almost 20 m/s and are known to change their heading direction to exceed a yaw rate of 0.4 rad/s. The high magnitudes of velocity, acceleration and jerk posed significant technical challenges, as the greyhounds pushed the human tracking system beyond its original design limits. Clean race data gathered over a six-month period were analysed and presented for a typical 2-turn greyhound racing track. The data confirmed that on average, greyhounds ran along a path that resulted in the least energy wastage, which includes smooth non-linear paths that resemble easement curves at the transition between the straights to the semi-circular bends. This study also verified that the maximum jerk levels greyhounds experienced while racing were lower than the jerk levels that had been predicted with simulations and modelling for the track path. Furthermore, the results from this study show the possibility of such a systems deployment in data gathering in similar settings to greyhound racing such as thoroughbred and harness horse racing for understanding biomechanical kinematic performance."

Conventional wisdom about running is passed down like folklore (and sometimes contradicts itself): the right kind of shoe prevents injury—or running barefoot, like our prehistoric ancestors, is best; eat a high-fat diet—and also carbo load before a race; running cures depression—but it might be addictive; running can save your life—although it can also destroy your knee cartilage. Often it's hard to know what to believe. In Running Smart, Mariska van Sprundel, a science journalist and recreational runner who has had her fair share of injuries, sets out to explore the science behind such claims. In her quest, van Sprundel reviews the latest developments in sports science, consults with a variety of experts, and visits a sports lab to have her running technique analyzed. She learns, among other things, that according to evolutionary biology, humans are perfectly adapted to running long distances (even if our hunter-gatherer forebears suffered plenty of injuries); that running sets off a shockwave that spreads from foot to head, which may or may not be absorbed by cushioned shoes; and that a good sports bra controls the ping pong–like movements of a female runner's breasts. She explains how the body burns fuel, the best foods to eat before and after running, and what might cause “runner's high.” More than fifty million Americans are runners (and a slight majority of them are women). This engaging and enlightening book will help both novice and seasoned runners run their smartest."

We aimed to evaluate outcomes with subjective clinical scores and imaging modalities after repair of isolated anterior horn tears, at 24 months' follow-up. Methods Records of all patients that opted for surgical repair of isolated, anterior horn tears of the medial and lateral meniscus were retrospectively reviewed, between 2016 and 2018. All patients were treated with arthroscopic outside-in technique by the same surgeon. Preoperative and postoperative clinical files were accessed to recover records of preoperative symptomatology, patient-reported scores [International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating, Lysholm score and Tegner activity level], preoperative and postoperative MRI data and time from injury to surgery. Results Mean age of eight patients was 25.25 years (range 18-37 years). Diagnostic preoperative MRI revealed isolated anterior horn tear of the lateral meniscus and medial meniscus in five patients and an isolated anterior horn tear of the medial meniscus in three patients. Mean time from injury to surgical repair was 23.75 days (range 7-43). We considered seven out of eight repairs to be successfully healed. At 24 months' follow-up: Mean Lysholm score was 92.25 (range 89-95), Tegner activity scale score was 6.5 (range 5-8) and IKDC score was 91.78 (range 87.8-94.4). All scores significantly improved compared to preoperative values (p<0.001). Conclusions Outside-in is a reliable technique to repair meniscal anterior horn tears, both medially and laterally, with high healing rates and patient satisfaction in young, active patients."

Among the underlying causes are overall slowness of motor response and vestibular syndrome. Virtual reality exergames, including reaction and balance training, hold promise for managing balance dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a combination rehabilitation program containing elements of virtual reality exergame on the postural and psychophysiological parameters of elderly patients with small vascular disease The study was conducted in 24 patients with small vascular disease (median age: 66 years). All patients underwent a virtual reality rehabilitation program. Psychophysiological, postural and clinical evaluations were performed at baseline and after the program was completed. Balance function measured on the Berg scale improved significantly and was 53 [52; 55] after the training program vs 50 [45; 54] at baseline (p &lt; 0.05). The strategy of balance control also changed: the Romberg ratio was 266 [199.5; 478.5] before rehabilitation and 221 [149.25; 404] after the program was completed (p &lt; 0.05). The most pronounced changes in the measured psychophysiological parameters occurred in the simple audiomotor reaction, which improved from 210 [174.25; 245.5] at baseline to 180.5 [170.5; 208] after rehabilitation (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, the combination balance and reaction virtual reality training is an effective rehabilitation method for advanced-age patients with balance impairment."

Although measures of maximal strength appear related to discrete CMJ variables, such as peak ground reaction forces (GRF) and center-of-mass (COM) velocity, knowledge about the association between strength and the time series patterns during CMJ will help characterize changes that can be expected in dynamic movement with changes in maximal strength.To investigate the associations between maximal strength and GRF and COM velocity patterns during CMJ.Nineteen female college lacrosse players performed 3 maximal-effort CMJs and isometric midthigh pull. GRF and COM velocity time series data from the CMJ were time normalized and used as inputs to principal-components analyses. Associations between isometric midthigh pull peak force and CMJ principal-component scores were investigated with a correlational analysis.Isometric midthigh pull peak force was associated with several GRF and COM velocity patterns. Correlations indicated that stronger players exhibited a GRF pattern characterized by greater eccentric-phase rate of force development, greater peak GRF, and a unimodal GRF profile (P = .016). Furthermore, stronger athletes exhibited a COM velocity pattern characterized by higher velocities during the concentric phase (P = .004).Maximal strength is correlated to specific GRF and COM velocity patterns during CMJ in female college lacrosse athletes. Since maximal strength was not correlated with discrete CMJ variables, the patterns extracted via principal-components analyses may provide information that is more beneficial for performance coaches and researchers."

Thus, the present study examined the acute effects of a single unilateral BT session conducted with the non-dominant, left leg or the dominant, right leg on ipsilateral (i.e. retention) and contralateral (i.e., inter-limb transfer) balance performance in healthy young adults ( N = 28). Results Irrespective of practice condition, significant improvements ( p &lt; 0.001, d = 1.27) in balance performance following a single session of unilateral BT were observed for both legs. Further, significant performance differences at the pretest ( p = 0.002, d = 0.44) to the detriment of the non-dominant, left leg diminished immediately and 30 min after the single unilateral BT session but occurred again 24 h following training ( p = 0.030, d = 0.36). These findings indicate that a single session of unilateral BT is effective to reduced side-to-side differences in balance performance, but this impact is only temporary."

However, the contest remains in fully deployable wearable (bio)chemical sensing. Its use is constrained by the energy consumption which is provided by miniaturized batteries, limiting the autonomy of the device. Hence, the combination of materials and engineering efforts to develop sustainable energy management is paramount in the next generation of wearable self‐powered electrochemical devices (WeSPEDs). In this direction, this review highlights for the first time the incorporation of innovative energy harvesting technologies with top‐notch wearable self‐powered sensors and low‐powered electrochemical sensors toward battery‐free and self‐sustainable devices for health and wellbeing management. First, current elements such as wearable designs, electrochemical sensors, energy harvesters and storage, and user interfaces that conform WeSPEDs are depicted. Importantly, the bottlenecks in the development of WeSPEDs from an analytical perspective, product side, and power needs are carefully addressed. Subsequently, energy harvesting opportunities to power wearable electrochemical sensors are discussed. Finally, key findings that will enable the next generation of wearable devices are proposed. Overall, this review aims to bring new strategies for an energy‐balanced deployment of WeSPEDs for successful monitoring of (bio)chemical parameters of the body toward personalized, predictive, and importantly, preventive healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3201572642,Muscle and Hip Contact Forces in Asymptomatic Men With Cam Morphology During Deep Squat,2021-09-09,2021,article,"Cam morphology is defined as an aspherical femoral head-neck junction that causes abnormal contact of the acetabular rim with the anterior hip. Imaging confirmation of the cam morphology, associated with clinical signs and pain in the hip or groin, is characterized as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. Although some individuals with cam morphology do not experience any symptoms, sparse studies have been done on these individuals. Understanding the way asymptomatic individuals generate muscle forces may help us to better explain the progression of the degenerative FAI process and discover better ways in preventing the onset or worsening of symptoms. The purpose of this study was to compare the muscle and hip contact forces of asymptomatic cam morphology (ACM) and FAI syndrome men compared to cam-free healthy controls during a deep squat task. This prospective study compared 39 participants, with 13 in each group (ACM, FAI, and control). Five deep squatting trials were performed at a self-selected pace while joint trajectories and ground reaction forces were recorded. A generic model was scaled for each participant, and inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics calculated joint angles and moments, respectively. Muscle and hip contact forces were estimated using static optimization. All variables were time normalized in percentage by the total squat cycle and both muscle forces and hip contact forces were normalized by body weight. Statistical non-parametric mapping analyses were used to compare the groups. The ACM group showed increased pelvic tilt and hip flexion angles compared to the FAI group during the descent and ascent phases of the squat cycle. Muscle forces were greater in the ACM and control groups, compared to the FAI group for the psoas and semimembranosus muscles. Biceps femoris muscle force was lower in the ACM group compared to the FAI group. The FAI group had lower posterior hip contact force compared to both the control and ACM groups. Muscle contraction strategy was different in the FAI group compared to the ACM and control groups, which caused different muscle force applications during hip extension. These results rebut the concept that mobility restrictions are solely caused by the presence of the cam morphology and propose evidence that symptoms and muscle contraction strategy can be the origin of the mobility restriction in male patients with FAI."
https://openalex.org/W3200507567,In Reply: Recommendation to Create New Neuropathological Guidelines for the Postmortem Diagnosis of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,2021-09-08,2021,letter,"To the Editor: We read with interest the recent letter by Omalu and Hammers1 and submit 2 major premises worthy of deliberation. Premise #1: Expand the clinical definition of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) to include a wide range of exposures, events, and presentations (Table1). TABLE 1. - Premise #1 by Omalu and Hammers: Asserting That the Clinical Definition of Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES) Should Be Expanded to Include a Wide Range of Exposures, Events, and Presentations Premise #1 “CTE is 1 speck in the broad spectrum of diseases that follow all types of brain trauma, which should be more appropriately referred to as the “traumatic encephalopathy syndromes” (TESs) including but not limited to subconcussions, concussions, postconcussion syndrome, post-traumatic encephalopathy, post-traumatic epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, mild behavioral impairment, mood disorders and other neuropsychiatric syndromes, CTE, neurovascular diseases, and dementia. There are clinical symptoms and signs that should in part define CTE, and like for the neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), clinical signs and symptoms and histories of exposure to acceleration-deceleration and blunt force injuries of the brain should be recognized in the diagnostic evaluation of CTE.”1 Response: The goal of defining TES as the direct clinical manifestation of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) neuropathological change should be to narrow the clinicopathological gap rather than widen it, mirroring the healthcare-wide movement toward precision medicine.2 The expanded TES definition proposed introduces substantial heterogeneity and complexity. For example, the authors suggest including post-traumatic epilepsy in the new definition of TES, yet post-traumatic seizures often occur acutely after a single brain injury3 and likely involve a different physiological process from the cumulative effect of repetitive brain impacts. The authors also suggest including CTE as a part of TES, even though CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem. Diagnosing CTE in a living patient can produce a significant nocebo effect, with resultant clinical deterioration, yet diagnosing CTE in living patients occurs commonly. A recent study reported that 108 retired, living National Football League players were diagnosed with CTE by a trained healthcare clinician.4,5 Inclusion of post-traumatic epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and mood disorders as clinical correlates of a postmortem CTE diagnosis may increase the possibility that clinicians will incorrectly diagnose CTE in living patients. The 2021 Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for TES clearly states that Substantial Exposure to Repetitive Head Impacts (RHI) must come from 1 of 3 categories: (1) high exposure to contact/collision sports, (2) military service involving RHIs, or (3) other sources of RHI such as domestic abuse or head banging.6 Omalu and Hammers ask to include biomechanical acceleration-deceleration events as an unbound criterion of CTE, which contradicts the 3 aforementioned categories. Neither a single concussion nor a single moderate-severe traumatic brain injury meets criteria for TES. Moreover, postconcussion syndrome or an episode of a psychological disorder following concussion would similarly not meet criteria for TES or CTE. It is important to rule out more explanatory neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders before rendering a diagnosis of TES.6 Premise #2: Neuropathological changes representing “Features of CTE” should be included in the definition of CTE (Table2). TABLE 2. - Premise #2 by Omalu and Hammers: Asserting That Neuropathological Changes Representing “Features of CTE” Should Be Included in the Definition of CTE Premise #2 “The current restriction by the CTE NDC of the diagnosis of CTE only to neocortical features of tau pathology does not represent the complete neuropathology of CTE. CTE also affects subcortical and brainstem white matter and nuclei, and diagnostic CTE criteria should recognize this widespread tau pathology and should not be limited only to tau pathology…As Bieniek et al2 have demonstrated, strict and rigid, mutually exclusive diagnostic thresholds and criteria for CTE as currently dictated by the CTE NDC may exclude 50% of CTE cases with features of CTE that exhibit neuropathological changes that are beneath these set diagnostic thresholds. Our professional experience, having examined thousands of brain trauma cases, is more consistent with the position of Bieniek et al. Such an exclusion of CTE cases will no doubt deny us critical insights into the differential pathoetiology and pathogenesis of CTE, other TESs, and other neurodegenerative diseases.”1 Response: The commentary suggests including tau pathology found in other parts of the brain, rather than exclusively in the depths of cortical sulci only, as diagnostic of CTE.1 Though inclusion of a prodromal state is reasonable, such as Aβ deposition in clinically normal elderly individuals,7 prior work has demonstrated that these neuropathological features are not specific to CTE, and individuals without a history of RHI may meet criteria for CTE neuropathological change. Of 39 cases with neuropathological evidence of CTE from a routine neuropathology service, 16 (41%) had no history of head injury.8 Regarding the Bieniek et al9 study cited by Omalu and Hammers, several cases that met the authors’ criteria for “Features of CTE” had co-occurring Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, as did 48% of cases that met full neuropathological criteria for CTE. A recent study by Mez and colleagues10 reported low specificity (21%) of the 2014 TES criteria for distinguishing the presence vs absence of a CTE neuropathological diagnosis in brain donors who all experienced RHI. While it is possible that expanding the neuropathological criteria of CTE may improve interrater reliability, this would significantly reduce the specificity and clinical utility of a CTE diagnosis. In contrast to the proposed expansion by Omalu and Hammers, authors of the recently published 2021 Second Consensus Meeting to Define the Neuropathological Criteria for the Diagnosis of CTE11 have taken steps toward further refinement, such as including neuronal profiles in all brain specimens and focusing on deep cortical layers not restricted to subpial and superficial regions. The pathognomonic lesion definition of CTE was further defined.11 The panel also cautioned that subpial thorn-shaped astrocytes or perivascular astrocytic pathology in isolation were consistent with aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) and did not meet the minimum criteria for CTE. CONCLUSION The science of CTE and TES is actively evolving, and we fully embrace the need to learn more about the potential detrimental effects of RHI. However, we caution that the suggestions offered by Omalu and Hammers may be in the wrong direction. Researchers should use the 2021 Clinical6 and Neuropathological11 Consensus Guidelines as a framework to further quantify definitions in need of refinement. Further reinforcing that we are in the early stages of CTE study, authors of the 2021 Consensus Clinical Guidelines for TES explicitly state that their criteria, “Are meant primarily for research purposes and should be used cautiously in clinical and medicolegal settings.”6 We must consider the implications of lending credence to overly broad definitions of CTE and TES. Broad, sweeping, nonspecific inclusion criteria can cause unnecessary anxiety by mislabeling individuals with a neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, the public interest in CTE may make misperceptions about the diagnosis more viable, guiding behavior and policy in a way that outpaces the data. We politely recommend that the scientific community elect to support a refinement approach highlighted above that follows the scientific process.

CrCL plays a fundamental role in the stability and biomechanics of the femoral-tibio-patellar joint, and its incorrect functionality severely impacts on the quality of life of patients. In dogs, the structural weakening of this joint due to the progressive degeneration of the ligament is the most accredited etiopathogenetic hypothesis in relation to the dog signalment (breed, sex and age) and the stifle joint conformation. In humans, this injury is often traumatic and generally occurs during sporting activities. CrCL rupture can be managed conservatively or surgically, and decisions regarding treatment are due to numerous factors: the patient’s age and health, the degree of stifle instability, and cost. Physiotherapy protocols play an important role in rehabilitation, with similar goals in humans and dogs: pain management, physiological articular range of motion recovery, periarticular and core muscle strengthening, and proprioceptive deficit correction. Physiotherapy, even if often neglected in veterinary medicine, is mandatory for the recovery of the correct functionality of the injured limb and for the return to normal daily and sporting activities."

https://openalex.org/W3197821286,A 2D qualitative movement assessment of a deceleration task detects football players with high knee joint loading,2021-09-04,2021,article,"Abstract Purpose The deceleration (pressing) is a common situational pattern leading to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in football. Although mainly assessed for performance purposes, a stronger focus on movement quality might support the screening of at-risk athletes. The aim of the present study was to describe a 2D scoring system for the assessment of the deceleration task and to associate it with the knee joint loading (knee abduction moment) evaluated through the gold standard 3D motion capture. The hypothesis was that lower 2D scores would be associated with higher knee joint loading. Methods Thirty-four competitive football (soccer) players (age 22.8 ± 4.1, 16 females) performed a series of deceleration tasks. 3D motion analysis was recorded using ten stereophotogrammetric cameras, a force platform, and three high-speed cameras. The 2D qualitative assessment was performed via a scoring system based on the video analysis of frontal and lateral planes joint kinematics for five scoring criteria. The intra- and inter-rater reliabilities were calculated for each 2D scoring criteria. The peak knee abduction moment was extracted and grouped according to the results of the 2D evaluation. Results An ICC &gt; 0.94 was found for all the 2D scoring criteria, both for intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. The players with low 2D frontal plane scores and low total scores (0–4) showed significantly higher peak knee abduction moment values ( p &lt; 0.001). A significant negative rank correlation was found between the total score and the peak knee abduction moment ( ρ = − 0.25, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The qualitative 2D scoring system described successfully discerned between athletes with high and low knee joint loading during a deceleration task. The application of this qualitative movement assessment based on a detailed and accurate scoring system is suitable to identify players and patients with high knee joint loading (high knee abduction moments) and target additional training in the scenario of the primary and secondary ACL injury risk reduction.

A review,2021-09-04,2021,review,"Abstract Aim To summarise lung function characteristics of athletic swimmers and discuss mechanisms explaining these changes while putting forward the lack of a clear understanding of the precise physiological factors implicated. Methods Literature search until 07.2021 on Medline and EMBASE using keywords swimming, athletes, respiratory physiology, lung development, lung function tests. Relevant articles in French and English were reviewed. Results We found insufficient data to perform a meta‐analysis. However, there is evidence that swimmers have better expiratory flows and increased baseline lung volumes than non‐athletes or non‐swimmers. Although these features can result from changes in lung development following intense training over the years, the contribution of a genetic predisposition and positive selection cannot be totally excluded. Conclusion Disentangling the participation of constitutional factors and years of hard training to explain the larger lung volumes of athletic swimmers is in favour of an adaptative response of the lungs to early swim training through modification of the pathway of lung development. There seems to be an optimal window of opportunity before the end of growth for these adaptational changes to occur. Precise mechanisms, and contribution of adaptative change on lung physiology, remain to be further studied."

Over the last decades there was an increase in match congestion. The increased match frequency and the associated injury risk have highlighted the importance of physical condition, increasing the need to implement new training methodologies with a special focus on load and fatigue management, as well as non-specific complementary training. The main objective of this study was to provide information on the structure and characteristics of the technical staffs, the methodological training practices, as well as the workload and fatigue control methods used in soccer, examining possible differences based on gender, category and competitive level. 190 soccer teams from 20 different countries participated in the study, by answering a survey. The results reveal that there are differences in the structure of the technical staff, the planning models, the methodology and the workload control depending on the category and the competitive level. Gender only appears as a discriminating variable, in relation to the most used complementary training contents. The weekly microcycle is the preferred planning model (80.89%), regardless the competitive level. However, in lower categories, medium and long term periodization are also used (23.80%). The weekly volume of complementary training increases as category (p=0.000) and competitive level (p=0.000) does. Strength training is the most used non-specific content (84.89%). However, its importance is reduced in lower categories (38.5%). Load and fatigue control are only extended among teams of superior category (p=0.000) and competitive level (p=0.000). Resumen.

The Rugby Football League is looking to deploy iMGs to quantify head acceleration exposures as part of the Tackle and Contact Kinematics, Loads and Exposure (TaCKLE) project. iMGs and associated software platforms are novel, thus limited validation studies exist. The aim of this paper is to describe the methods that will determine the validity (ie, laboratory validation of kinematic measures and on-field validity) and feasibility (ie, player comfort and wearability and practitioner considerations) of available iMGs for quantifying head acceleration events in rugby league. Phase 1 will determine the reliability and validity of iMG kinematic measures (peak linear acceleration, peak rotational velocity, peak rotational acceleration), based on laboratory criterion standards. Players will have three-dimensional dental scans and be provided with available iMGs for phase 2 and phase 3. Phase 2 will determine the on-field validity of iMGs (ie, identifying true positive head acceleration events during a match). Phase 3 will evaluate player perceptions of fit (too loose, too tight, bulky, small/thin, held mouth open, held teeth apart, pain in jaw muscles, uneven bite), comfort (on lips, gum, tongue, teeth) and function (speech, swallowing, dry mouth). Phase 4 will evaluate the practical feasibility of iMGs, as determined by practitioners using the system usability scale (preparing iMG system and managing iMG data). The outcome will provide a systematic and robust assessment of a range of iMGs, which will help inform the suitability of each iMG system for the TaCKLE project."

Given data that show rates of successful return to competitive sport at around 55%, there is strong rationale for adopting tools that will better inform return to sport decisions. The authors' objective was to assess reactive strength as a metric for informing return-to-sport decisions.Case-control design.Fifteen elite athletes from national sports teams (23 [6.0] y) in the final phase of their return-to-sport protocol following a unilateral knee injury and 16 age-matched control athletes (22 [4.6] y) performed a unilateral isometric strength test and 24-cm drop jump test. Pairwise comparisons were used to determine differences between legs within groups and differences in interleg asymmetry between groups.Strength measures did not distinguish the control from the rehabilitation group; however, clear differences in the degree of asymmetry were apparent between the control and rehabilitation groups for contact time (Cohen d = 0.56; -0.14 to 1.27; 8.2%; P = .113), flight time (d = 1.10; 0.44 to 1.76; 16.0%; P = .002), and reactive strength index (d = 1.27; 0.50 to 2.04; 22.4%; P = .002).Reactive strength data provide insight into functional deficits that persist into the final phase of a return-to-sport protocol. The authors' findings support the use of dynamic assessment tools to inform return-to-sport decisions to limit potential for reinjury."

Analysis of Former Individually Prized Young Selected Male Basketball Players,2021-09-01,2021,article,"""Success in team sports foremostly depends on individual performance and the cooperation of the team members. We aimed to investigate the individual performance changes of youth awarded basketball players from youth to senior national team level. For this purpose we examined four game-related basketball statistics: Minutes Played (MP), Points Scored (PS), Rebounds (REB), and Assists (AST) both in youth and senior level with regression analysis. We collected all the individually prized players of former youth European Championships available on the most reliable websites (N=323). We used descriptive statistical methods and also investigated correlation between their prized performance and their senior peak performance on national level (p&lt;0.01). Our analysis showed that a larger amount of the previously awarded players became member of their senior national team (58%, n=188). 90.71% of the awarded players (n=293) were the first or second best scoring leader of their own team in their youth prime. We found moderate significant correlation between youth rebounds and senior rebounds, also youth assists and senior assists, but only weak correlation between youth and senior Minutes Played and Points Scored. From this aspect getting awards on youth level can boost an athlete’s career, but it doesn’t mean to reach the same peak when they are selected to the senior squads as time and age are dominant background variables, an extended analysis is needed in the future."""

The aim of this study is to determine the influence of the size of the lateral and medial femoral condyles on ACL rupture. Methods: 41 matched pairs of subjects were included in the study who had suffered knee injury and were either professional or recreational athletes engaged in track and field or sports involving intensive rotation movements. The experimental group was composed of patients with ACL rupture, while the control group comprised patients with joint distortion without ACL. The diameter of the medial and lateral condyles were measured on sagittal MRI images of these patients’ knees. Results: Subjects with ACL rupture had a highly statistically significantly shorter diameter of the lateral condyle as compared to their matched pairs from the control group (p&lt;0.01). Also, the lateral condyle of the subjects with ACL rupture had a significantly lesser diameter as compared to the medial condyle (p&lt;0.01), which was not the case in patients without ACL rupture (p&gt;0.05). Patients with intact ACL demonstrated significant indirect correlation of the diameter of both femoral condyles with the valgus angle of the lower leg (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions: The shorter diameter of the lateral femoral condyle is connected with ACL rupture, both in women and men. The lack of correlation between the diameter of the femoral condyles and the valgus angle of the lower leg also represents a factor connected to ACL rupture."

https://openalex.org/W3197533011,Automatic high fidelity foot contact location and timing for elite sprinting,2021-08-28,2021,article,"Abstract Making accurate measurements of human body motions using only passive, non-interfering sensors such as video is a difficult task with a wide range of applications throughout biomechanics, health, sports and entertainment. The rise of machine learning-based human pose estimation has allowed for impressive performance gains, but machine learning-based systems require large datasets which might not be practical for niche applications. As such, it may be necessary to adapt systems trained for more general-purpose goals, but this might require a sacrifice in accuracy when compared with systems specifically developed for the application. This paper proposes two approaches to measuring a sprinter’s foot-ground contact locations and timing (step length and step frequency), a task which requires high accuracy. The first approach is a learning-free system based on occupancy maps. The second approach is a multi-camera 3D fusion of a state-of-the-art machine learning-based human pose estimation model. Both systems use the same underlying multi-camera system. The experiments show the learning-free computer vision algorithm to provide foot timing to better than 1 frame at 180 fps, and step length accurate to 7 mm, while the system based on pose estimation achieves timing better than 1.5 frames at 180 fps, and step length estimates accurate to 20 mm."

Methods: Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, and IEEE databases were searched using terms identified with the Population, Interest and Context (PiCo) framework. Studies were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and appraised using the methodological index for non-randomized studies MINORS scale. Only experimental studies with at least 10 participants, which evaluated fatigue during and immediately after the fatiguing run were included. Each study was summarized to record information about the protocol and parameter trends. Summary trends were computed for each parameter based on the results found in individual studies. Results: Of the 68 included studies, most were based on in-lab (77.9%) protocols, endpoint measurements (75%), stationary measurement systems (76.5%), and treadmill environment (54.4%) for running. From the 42 parameters identified in response to acute fatigue, flight time, contact time, knee flexion angle at initial contact, trunk flexion angle, peak tibial acceleration, CoP velocity during balance test showed an increasing behavior and cadence, vertical stiffness, knee extension force during MVC, maximum vertical ground reaction forces, and CMJ height showed a decreasing trend across different fatigue protocols. Conclusion: This review presents evidence that running-induced acute fatigue influences almost all the included biomechanical parameters, with crucial influence from the exercise intensity and the testing environment. Results indicate an important gap in literature caused by the lack of field studies with continuous measurement during outdoor running activities. To address this gap, we propose recommendations for the use of wearable inertial sensors."

Design: Clinic-based cross-sectional study. Participants: 114 HTG subjects and 114 NTG subjects. Methods. We recruited 228 subjects (114 subjects with HTG [pre-treatment IOP &gt; 21mmHg] and 114 with NTG [pre-treatment IOP &lt; 21mmHg]). For each subject, we imaged the ONH using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) under the following conditions: (1) primary gaze, (2) 20 degree adduction, (3) 20 degree abduction, and (4) primary gaze with acute IOP elevation (to approximately 33 mmHg) achieved through ophthalmodynamometry. For each OCT volume, we automatically segmented the prelaminar tissue (PLT), the choroid, the sclera and the lamina cribrosa (LC) using a deep learning algorithm. We also digitally aligned the OCT volumes obtained from (2)-(4) to the primary gaze volume (1) before performing digital volume correlation (DVC) analysis to quantify IOP- and gaze-induced ONH tissues three-dimensional displacements and effective strain (a local measure of tissue deformation) for all scenarios. Main Outcome Measures: Three-dimensional ONH displacements and strains. Results: Across all subjects, adduction generated high effective strain (4.2 ± 1.4%) in the ONH tissues with no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) with those induced by IOP elevation (4.5 ± 1.5%); while abduction generated significantly lower (p = 0.014) effective strain (3.8 ± 1.1%). Interestingly, the LC of HTG subjects exhibited significantly higher effective strain than those of NTG subjects under IOP elevation (HTG:4.6 ± 1.7% vs NTG:4.1 ± 1.5%, p = 0.047). Conversely, the LC tissue of NTG subjects exhibited significantly higher effective strain than those of HTG subjects under adduction (NTG: 4.9 ± 1.9% vs HTG: 4.0 ± 1.4%, p = 0.041). Conclusion: We found that adduction produced comparable strains and displacements as IOP elevation. We also found that NTG subjects experienced higher strains due to adduction than HTG subjects, while HTG subjects experienced higher strain due to IOP elevation than NTG subjects - and that these differences were most pronounced in the LC tissue."

As unsustainable human activities threaten many primate species with extinction, effective conservation strategies for endangered primates will depend upon our understanding of behavioural response to human-modified habitats. This is especially true for the apes, who are arguably our most powerful connection to the natural world. Recognising the inseparability of the natural and the social, the dialectical approach in this book highlights the heterogeneity and complexity of ecological relationships. Malone stresses that ape conservation requires a synthesis of nature and culture that recognises their inseparability in ecological relationships that are both biophysically and socially formed, and seeks to identify the pathways that lead to either hominoid coexistence or, alternatively, extinction. This book will be of keen interest to academics in biological anthropology, primatology, environmental anthropology, conservation and human–animal studies."

Despite this, many athletes are reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance. OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise. METHODS Healthy participants completed a 20-minute bout of graded cycling exercise before and ~21 days after COVID-19 vaccination (2 dose Pfizer mRNA or 1 dose Johnson &amp; Johnson). RESULTS Oxygen uptake, CO 2 production, respiratory exchange ratio, ventilation, heart rate, serum noradrenaline, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly elevated in the post vaccine trial. However, vaccination did not affect serum lactate, adrenaline, cortisol, predicted , and ventilatory threshold. Post-vaccine effects on heart rate and noradrenaline remained significant in non-infected participants that received the Pfizer vaccine. No significant effects in respiratory gas exchange parameters were found after vaccination in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but exercise adrenaline levels were significantly lower and serum lactate levels trending (p= 0.10) lower after vaccination. No changes in any physiological responses to exercise were found in control participants who completed two bouts of exercise separated by ~5 weeks without vaccination. CONCLUSION Recent COVID-19 vaccination is associated with modest increases in the physiological demands to graded exercise in non-infected healthy people but may actually improve metabolic responses to exercise in those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Whether or not these small effects could impact athletic performance at the elite level warrants investigation."

These issues concern trust between the human user and automated or AI tools of interest, resilience, safety, and transparency. To tackle these issues, we advocate the development of practical AI ATCO teaming frameworks by bringing together concepts and theories from neuroscience and explainable AI (XAI). By pooling together knowledge from both ATCO and AI perspectives, we seek to establish confidence in AI-enabled technologies for ATCOs. In this review, we present an overview of the extant studies that shed light on the research and development of trusted human-AI systems, and discuss the prospects of extending such works to building better trusted ATCO-AI systems.

Global Positioning System-Based Variables’ Effect on the Match Outcome: A Full-Season Study on an Iranian Professional Soccer Team",2021-08-24,2021,article,"The aim of the study was to determine the between-match and between-halves match variability of various Global Positioning System (GPS) variables and metabolic power average (MPA) in competitions, based on the match results obtained by professional soccer players over a full season. Observations on individual match performance measures were undertaken on thirteen outfield players competing in the Iranian Premier League. The measures selected for analysis included total duration, accelerations in zones (AccZ1, 2, and 3), decelerations in zones (DecZ1, 2, and 3), and MPA collected by the Wearable Inertial Measurement Unit (WIMU). The GPS manufacturer set the thresholds for the variables analyzed as follows: AccZ1 (&lt;2 m·s−2); AccZ2 (2 to 4 m·s−2); AccZ3 (&gt;4 m·s−2); DecZ1 (&lt;−2 m·s−2); DecZ2 (−2 to −4 m·s−2); DecZ3 (&gt;−4 m·s−2). The results revealed significant differences between wins and draws for the duration of the match and draws compared to wins for the first- half duration (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.36 [−0.43, 1.12]), (p ≤ 0.05; ES = −7.0 [−8.78, −4.78], respectively. There were significant differences on AccZ1 during the first-half between draws and defeats (p ≤ 0.05; ES = −0.43 [−1.32, 0.46]), for AccZ3 in the second-half between draws and defeats (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 1.37 [0.48, 2.25]). In addition, there were significant differences between wins and draws (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.22 [−0.62, 1.10]), and wins and defeats for MPA in the first- half (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.34 [−0.65, 1.22]). MPA showed further differences between draws and defeats in the second- half (p ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.57 [−0.22, 1.35]). Descriptive analysis revealed differences between the first and second half for wins in AccZ2 (p = 0.005), DecZ2 (p = 0.029), and MPA (p = 0.048). In addition, draws showed significant differences between the first and second half in duration, AccZ1, AccZ2, and DecZ2 (p = 0.008), (p = 0.017), (p = 0.040), and (p = 0.037) respectively. Defeats showed differences between the first and second half in AccZ1, AccZ3, and MPA (p = 0.001), (p = 0.018), and (p = 0.003) respectively. In summary, the study reveals large variations between the match duration, accelerometer variables, and MPA both within and between matches. Regardless of the match outcome, the first half seems to produce greater outputs. The results should be considered when performing a half-time re-warm-up, as this may be an additional factor influencing the drop in the intensity markers in the second half in conjunction with factors such as fatigue, pacing strategies, and other contextual variables that may influence the results."

Acupuncture can effectively enhance musculoskeletal rehabilitation, with effects such as reduced pain intensity and muscle tension and decreased disability. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA) compared with sham acupuncture (SA) in explosive force production by the forearm muscles in females. Methods. A total of 32 subjects were included and randomly assigned to two groups: TCA group (n = 16): stimulated specific acupoints including Quchi (LI11), Shousanli (LI10), Hegu (LI4), Xiaohai (SI8), Tianjing (SJ10), and Waiguan (SJ5) for 15 minutes; SA group (n = 16): using superficial needle insertion at nonacupoints without stimulation. The subjects warmed up for the 3-time isokinetic test with an angular velocity of 30°/s and then performed a set of 15 full flexion (Flex) and extension (Ext) with an angular velocity of 180°/s using the CON-TREX isokinetic test training system recorded as the pretest. After acupuncture for 15 min, perform a set of the same isokinetic movement isokinetic records as the posttest. The average max torque, average work, average power, average peak power, average max speed, and total work were collected to evaluate the forearm explosive force changes. Use two-way repeated measures ANOVA to compare the difference before and after acupuncture between two groups. Results. The results showed that acupuncture conditions (sham acupuncture as well as true acupuncture) and the intervention times (not acupuncture or acupuncture for 15 min) have a significant interaction effect on forearm explosive force and joint stiffness ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). The simple main effect showed that the selected parameters of the TCA group increased significantly after acupuncture ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M2""> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ), while the SA group did not ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M3""> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&gt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). We speculate that the activation of muscle may be related to the selected acupuncture points. Conclusion. Acupuncture can produce excitation in motor nerves and muscles, and nerve stimulation increases the recruitment of motor units, thus improving the muscle explosive force."

The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation of kinematics and kinetics of changing sagittal plane body position during landing and the risk of non-contact ACL injury. Seven university female (age 19.57 ± 0.79 y, height 164.21 ± 8.11 m, weight 60.43 ± 5.99 kg) athletes playing soccer and handball, and with ≥ two years of training volunteered for this research. Three trunk positions: Lean Forward Landing (LFL), Self-selected Landing (SSL), and Upright Landing (URL)—via double/single-leg landing—were captured by a high-speed VICON motion capture system. A 3 × 2 two-way within-subjects ANOVA and Multiple Bonferroni corrected pairwise were used to test for condition (LFL, SSL, URL) and task (single/double-leg) effects (p≤ 0.05). The findings indicated that landing with a deeper knee flexion angle (LFL) would lead to smaller impact forces when compared to upright landing."
https://openalex.org/W3199021184,"Comparison of Static Balance among Cricket, Badminton, Football and Track and Field Athletes",2021-08-23,2021,article,"BACKGROUND The balance plays an indispensable role in many sports. Static balance is crucial for a postural control and has an exceptional effect on the performance of sports players and for injury prevention. Sports like cricket, football, track and field, and badminton requires static balance for the execution of a sports-specific skill. Single leg stance test was used to assess balance on a surface during a 30 sec single-leg standing posture with eyes open and eyes closed. The main goal of this study was to determine that, in which sport the static balance was more and in which sport the static balance was inferior. The objectives were to assess the static balance in cricket, badminton, track and field, football athletes and compare the static balance in all 4 sports [cricket, badminton, track and field, football] METHODS A total of one hundred and twenty - four athletes [124], cricket {N = 31}, football {N = 31}, badminton {N = 31}, track and field {N = 31} voluntarily participated in the study. Static balance was assessed by using single leg stance test with eyes open and eyes closed. RESULTS By comparing all sports, it showed that there was a statistically significant difference between cricket, football, badminton and track and field athletes in dominant and non - dominant leg with eyes open and eyes closed. With eyes open, a static balance was demonstrated superior in track and field followed by football, cricket and least in badminton players in the dominant leg and non-dominant leg. (P &lt; 0.0001) Whereas, with eyes closed, comparing between sports individually, there showed no such significant difference between dominant and non-dominant leg. Static balance was superior in track and field followed by football, by cricket and least in badminton in dominant and non-dominant leg (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Track and field players did not differ in dominant and non-dominant legs. In contrast, badminton players displayed mediocre static balance with eyes open and football players displayed mediocre static balance with eyes closed. There was no significant difference between open and closed eyes. But the balance score showed superior balance in open eyes when compared with closed eyes.

https://openalex.org/W3195890996,A Motion Capturing and Energy Harvesting Hybridized Lower‐Limb System for Rehabilitation and Sports Applications,2021-08-19,2021,article,"Lower-limb motion monitoring is highly desired in various application scenarios ranging from rehabilitation to sports training. However, there still lacks a cost-effective, energy-saving, and computational complexity-reducing solution for this specific demand. Here, a motion capturing and energy harvesting hybridized lower-limb (MC-EH-HL) system with 3D printing is demonstrated. It enables low-frequency biomechanical energy harvesting with a sliding block-rail piezoelectric generator (S-PEG) and lower-limb motion sensing with a ratchet-based triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG). A unique S-PEG is proposed with particularly designed mechanical structures to convert lower-limb 3D motion into 1D linear sliding on the rail. On the one hand, high output power is achieved with the S-PEG working at a very low frequency, which realizes self-sustainable systems for wireless sensing under the Internet of Things framework. On the other hand, the R-TENG gives rise to digitalized triboelectric output, matching the rotation angles to the pulse numbers. Additional physical parameters can be estimated to enrich the sensory dimension. Accordingly, demonstrative rehabilitation, human-machine interfacing in virtual reality, and sports monitoring are presented. This developed hybridized system exhibits an economic and energy-efficient solution to support the need for lower-limb motion tracking in various scenarios, paving the way for self-sustainable multidimensional motion tracking systems in near future."

Muscle strength is among the most important determinants of CoD ability. However, previous studies investigating the relationship between CoD ability and muscle strength focused mostly on flexor and extensor muscle groups, or used multi-joint exercises, such as jumps, squats or mid-thigh pull. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between CoD ability and strength of ankle, knee, hip and trunk maximal and explosive strength. The participants (n = 327), consisting of male and female basketball players, tennis players and long-distance runners completed isometric strength assessments and CoD testing (90° and 180° turn tests). The times of both CoD tests were associated with muscle strength (peak torques and the rate of torque development variables), with correlation coefficients being mostly weak to moderate (r = 0.2–0.6). Strength variables explained 33%, 62% and 48% of the variance in the 90° turn task, and 42%, 36% and 59% of the variance in the 180° turn task, in basketball players, long-distance runners and tennis players, respectively. Hip and trunk muscle strength variables were the most prevalent in the regression models, especially hip adduction and abduction strength. Our results suggest that the strength of several lower limb muscles, in particular of the hip abductors and adductors, and trunk muscles, but also hip rotators, extensors and flexors, as well as knee and ankle flexors and extensors should be considered when aiming to improve CoD performance."
https://openalex.org/W3195406165,The Effect of Fatigue on Single-Leg Postural Sway and Its Transient Characteristics in Healthy Young Adults,2021-08-18,2021,article,"Neuromuscular fatigue is known to impair balance ability, which is reflected in increased postural sway during quiet standing tasks. Recently, quantifying transient characteristics of postural sway has been suggested as an approach to obtain additional information regarding postural control. However, this approach is currently vastly unexplored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of fatigue (induced by a repeated change of direction task) on postural sway and its transient characteristics during single-leg standing, including whole-trial estimates and indexes of transient behavior in young healthy active adults. The study involved 28 physically active students (14 females). Single-leg postural sway was recorded for 30s before and after a fatiguing protocol, which consisted of a repeated change of direction tasks. We calculated the traditional whole-trial estimates of postural sway [center-of-pressure (CoP) velocity and amplitude in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions] and corresponding transient behavior indexes, based on three 10-s intervals. Statistically significant sex×fatigue interaction with medium effect sizes was found for whole-trial CoP velocity in AP ( p =0.028; η 2 =0.17) and ML directions ( p =0.019; η 2 =0.19). Post-hoc test showed that both variables substantially decreased in female participants ( p =0.041–0.045; d =0.54–0.56), but remained similar in males ( p =0.194–0.294). There were small to medium statistically significant main effects of fatigue on transient index for CoP amplitude in both directions ( p =0.042–0.049; η 2 =0.02–0.14). Notably, CoP AP amplitude increased in the first 10-s interval for males (before fatigue: 5.6±1.3mm; after fatigue: 6.3±1.6mm), while the CoP AP amplitude in the third interval remained similar after fatigue (before fatigue: 5.5±1.4mm; after fatigue: 5.1±1.2mm). In conclusion, the responses to fatigue in terms of postural sway were time interval specific, and there were certain sex-differences in responses to fatigue, which could be related to better ability to adapt balance strategies in females. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the indexes of transient behavior could perhaps detect smaller fatigue-induced changes in postural sway that are seen in whole-trial estimates."

There is a lack of substantial information for its operative treatment and rehabilitation; in particular there is a lack of biomechanical data to evaluate long-term outcomes. Case presentation: The case report presents the injury mechanism and surgical treatment of a complete avulsion of the proximal rectus femoris muscle in a 41-year-old recreational endurance athlete. Moreover, within a one-year follow-up period, different biomechanical tests were performed to get more functional insights into changes in neuromuscular control, structural muscle characteristics, and endurance performance. Within the first month post-surgery, an almost total neuromuscular inhibition of the rectus femoris muscle was present. A stepwise reduction in inter-limb compensations was observable (e.g., in crank torque during cycling) during the rehabilitation. Muscular intra-limb compensations were shown at six months post-surgery and even one year after surgery, which were also represented in the long-term adaption of the muscle characteristics and leg volumes. A changed motor control strategy was shown by asymmetric muscle activation patterns during ergometer cycling, while the power output was almost symmetric. During rehabilitation, there might be a benefit to normalizing neuromuscular muscle activation in ergometer cycling using higher loads. Conclusions: While the endurance performance recovered after six months, asymmetries in neuromuscular control and structural muscle characteristics indicate the long-term presence of inter- and intra-limb compensation strategies."

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a relatively common injury to the inner part of the knee joint, mainly related to contact sports. Its rupture leads to instability of the entire joint. Two treatment options are possible: operative or conservative. Each of them is related to an appropriate rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to define a comprehensive rehabilitation plan in patients after ACL rupture and meniscal suturing.Materials and methods: The work was written based on the medical history of the patient who was diagnosed with complete rupture of ACL, and then reconstruction was performed with the harvesting of a semitendinous and slender muscle graft.Results: The rehabilitation process can be divided into two stages: hospital and post-hospital. Rehabilitation in hospital conditions begins on the zero day after arthroscopy. The main goals of rehabilitation include: increasing the range of mobility, no myofascial dysfunctions, no thromboembolic complications, and the ability to self-service.Conclusion: Rehabilitation is an indispensable element of the treatment of patients after ACL reconstruction. Early initiation of rehabilitation brings tangible benefits during treatment and return to full physical fitness."

High school and collegiate athletes are at particularly high risk for sustaining a dislocation event. Despite the prevalence of these injuries, there is a paucity in the literature regarding incidence of sports-related shoulder dislocations and mechanism of injury within these populations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to (1) determine the incidence rate of shoulder dislocations in high school–aged and collegiate-aged athletes presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States; (2) to determine the most common sports associated with shoulder dislocations; and (3) to compare the current rates and risk factors for shoulder dislocation with previous trends.MethodsThe National Electronic Injury Surveillance System is a statistically validated injury surveillance system that collects data from ED visits as a representative probability sample of hospitals in the United States. We queried the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for the years 2015-2019 to examine the following variables for sports-related shoulder dislocations: patient age (high school = 13-17 years of age; collegiate = 18-23 years of age), sex, year of admission, and sport type. Using a weighted multiplier, annual incidence rates were estimated based on the US Census estimates and injury rates were compared by sex and age group across the study period.ResultsFrom 2015 to 2019, there were a total of 1329 athletic-related shoulder dislocations that presented to participating EDs. Of these, 698 (52.5%) shoulder dislocations occurred in collegiate athletes, while 631 (47.5%) occurred in high school athletes. Using weighted and adjusted estimates automatically generated by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database, this translates to 89,511 total athletic-related shoulder dislocations across the United States (95% confidence interval lower bound 68,224; 95% confidence interval upper bound 110,798). Male athletes demonstrated a higher proportion of shoulder dislocations (87%) than female athletes (13%). The most common sport-specific mechanisms of traumatic shoulder dislocation were basketball (24.1%), football (21%), soccer (7.1%), baseball (7.1%), and weightlifting (3.3%).ConclusionSports-related shoulder dislocations are frequent in high school–aged and college-aged athletes presenting to the ED. Interventions to reduce incidence of injury should be sport-specific and focus on those participating in contact and noncontact sports. Male athletes have disproportionately higher rates of dislocation. These findings are consistent with the previous epidemiologic trends in the literature that have examined the incidence of shoulder dislocations in this population."

Here, we propose that how people come to know their performance landscapes, and how they learn to correspond with available affordances in them, is through dwelling. More specifically, through dwelling, people learn to resonate with the rhythms of information and affordances of a performance landscape, entangling with them to successfully find their way through the tasks, problems and challenges taken up with. To theoretically support our analysis, we draw on James Gibson's different conceptualisations of knowledge, and Tim Ingold's perspectives of enskilment – bringing practical applicability to our discussion by weaving in various ethnographic accounts of the growth of enskiled inhabitant knowledge. Through these transdisciplinary insights, we show that it is by asking questions, sharing stories, and following up lines of inquiry that people grow into their enskiled knowledge of places they inhabit."

Its management involves conservative treatment with early weight-bearing or surgical treatment. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has raised interest as an adjuvant for treatment, given its properties on tendon repair and its anti-inflammatory effect. We aimed to assess clinical impact of PRP use in surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute ATR: range of motion, muscle strength, function, return to sport and adverse events.A systematic literature research was performed using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases to collect studies reporting clinical outcomes after acute ATR treated with PRP.Eight studies were eligible and included 543 acute ATR. Four were randomized comparative studies. A total of 128 patients were treated surgically and 415 were treated conservatively, 271 received PRP injection. Five studies described the type of PRP used, which was variable. Only one study including 12 patients found significant outcomes in favor of the PRP group, with a 4-week earlier recovery of a normal range of motion and a 7-week earlier return to running. No difference in clinical or morphological evaluations, strength measurement, and functional outcomes was found in other studies both at short and long-term. PRP did not seem to modify the frequency of adverse events.Data are not clearly in favor of a significant effect of the PRP use for treatment of ATR. There might be a slight effect on evolution during the first months. Its interest should be assessed in future studies with strong methodology."

https://openalex.org/W3190199816,An epidemiologic comparison of acute and overuse injuries in high school sports,2021-08-11,2021,article,"Abstract Background Acute and overuse injuries affect millions of high school athletes annually and a better understanding of differences between these injuries is needed to help guide prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies. This study compares acute and overuse injuries using a nationally representative sample of high school athletes. Methods Injuries among United States high school athletes participating in 5 boys’ sports (football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball) and 4 girls’ sports (soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball) reported in the High School RIO™ surveillance system during the 2006-07 through 2018-19 school years were classified as acute or overuse. National estimates and injury rates were calculated. Results Of 17 434 646 estimated injuries, 92.0 % were acute and 8.0 % were overuse. The acute injury rate was higher than the overuse injury rate among both male (Rate Ratio [RR] 16.38, 95 % CI: 15.70–17.10) and female (RR 8.14, 95 % CI: 7.71–8.60) athletes. The overuse injury rate per 10,000 athlete exposures among female athletes (1.8) was slightly higher than among males (1.4). The rate of acute injury compared with the rate of overuse injury was higher during competition (RR 32.00, 95 % CI: 29.93–34.22) than practice (RR 7.19, 95 % CI: 6.91–7.47). Boys’ football contributed the most acute (42.1 %) and overuse (23.7 %) injuries among the 9 sports. Among female sports, girls’ soccer contributed the most acute (15.6 % of all acute injuries) and overuse (19.4 % of all overuse injuries) injuries. The lower extremity was most commonly injured in acute (48.9 %) and overuse (65.9 %) injuries. Ligament sprain (31.7 %) and concussion (21.0 %) were the most common acute injury diagnoses, while muscle strain (23.3 %) and tendonitis (23.2 %) were the most common overuse injury diagnoses. Compared with acute injuries, overuse injuries were more likely to result in time loss from sports participation of &lt; 1 week among both boys and girls and across most sports. Acute injuries were more likely than overuse injuries to cause a time loss of 1–3 weeks or medical disqualification from sports participation. Conclusions Acute and overuse injuries display many differences that provide opportunities for data-informed athlete preparation, treatment, and rehabilitation, which may reduce injuries and improve injury outcomes in high school athletics."
https://openalex.org/W3189458935,An ecological dynamics approach to ACL injury risk research: a current opinion,2021-08-10,2021,article,"Research of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk aims to identify modifiable risk factors that are linked to the mechanisms of injury. Information from these studies is then used in the development of injury prevention programmes. However, ACL injury risk research often leans towards methods with three limitations: 1) a poor preservation of the athlete-environment relationship that limits the generalisability of results, 2) the use of a strictly biomechanical approach to injury causation that is incomplete for the description of injury mechanisms, 3) and a reductionist analysis that neglects profound information regarding human movement. This current opinion proposes three principles from an ecological dynamics perspective that address these limitations. First, it is argued that, to improve the generalisability of findings, research requires a well-preserved athlete-environment relationship. Second, the merit of including behaviour and the playing situation in the model of injury causation is presented. Third, this paper advocates that research benefits from conducting non-reductionist analysis (i.e., more holistic) that provides profound information regarding human movement. Together, these principles facilitate an ecological dynamics approach to injury risk research that helps to expand our understanding of injury mechanisms and thus contributes to the development of preventative measures."

The aim of our present study was to assess the association between COL12A1 rs970547 polymorphism and ACLR risk. Methods: Five online databases, namely, PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, CENTRAL, and CNKI, were searched from their inception data up to December 2020 to identify relative observational studies. The methodological quality of each individual study was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The “model-free approach” was employed to estimate the magnitude of effect of COL12A1 rs970547 polymorphism on ACLR, and the association was expressed using odds ratio (OR) and its associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity and sex of included subjects. Results: Eight studies involving 1,477 subjects with ACLR and 100,439 healthy controls were finally included in our study. The methodological quality of included studies was deemed moderate to high based on NOS scores. The “model-free” approach suggested no genotype differences between ACLR and healthy control for the rs970547 polymorphism, but we still used the allele model to present the combined data. Under the random-effect model, there was no significant difference in the frequency of effecting allele between ACLR and control (OR: 0.91, 95% CI 0.77, 1.08; p = 0.28). Stratified analysis by sex and ethnicity also showed no difference in allele frequency. Conclusion: The findings of this current meta-analysis suggested that rs970547 was not associated with ACLR risk in male, female, and the overall population among Asians or Caucasians."

Fue una investigación de nivel descriptivo, con un diseño de campo, basado en un estudio de caso con una atleta de 15 años. Se utilizó el método videográfico tridimensional (3D) con los enfoques: cuantitativo (programa “Human v 5.0”) y cualitativo (escala Likert). Se cuantificaron las variables cinemáticas mediante pre y pos test. Se establecieron criterios de eficiencia para optimizar variables biomecánicas en las fases: Preparatoria y Pateo. Así, se orientó el entrenamiento de la adolescente en función de fortalezas y debilidades identificadas desde la perspectiva biomecánica, lo que permitió optimizar la técnica de los miembros inferiores, dominante y no dominante. Entre otros resultados, destacó el aumento de sincronización y consecuente mejoría del patrón temporal de movimiento lo que facilitó la coordinación de impulso parcial, y por ende la transferencia de energía del cuerpo hacia el balón, incidiendo positivamente en la velocidad resultante, trayectoria y precisión del balón con lo cual aumentó la frecuencia del gol, hecho que incidió en el rendimiento y perfil de la joven, destacándose en la posición lateral con un manejo eficiente del balón por ambos perfiles. The present investigation was carried out with the objective of analyzing the kinematic variables that are manifested in the kicking technique in soccer based on biomechanical efficiency criteria. It was a descriptive level investigation, with a field design, based on a case study with a 15-year-old athlete. The three-dimensional (3D) videographic method was used with the approaches: quantitative (“Human v 5.0” program) and qualitative (Likert scale). Kinematic variables were quantified by pre and posttest. Efficiency criteria were established to optimize biomechanical variables in the phases: Preparatory and Kicking. Thus, the adolescent's training was oriented according to the strengths and weaknesses identified from the biomechanical perspective, which allowed optimizing the technique of the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. Among other results, the increase in synchronization and consequent improvement in the temporal pattern of movement stood out, which facilitated the coordination of partial impulse, and therefore the transfer of energy from the body to the ball, positively influencing the resulting speed, trajectory and precision of the ball which increased the frequency of the goal, a fact that affected the performance and profile of the young woman, standing out in the lateral position with an efficient handling of the ball by both profile."

This investigation occured at the level of the main parameters, measured using the FreeMed baropodometric platform and Free Step software by Sensor Medica: plantar surface areas, location of the pressure center (C) inside the support polygon, imbalances noticed at the level of the plantar areas, Pmax value, weight distribution on each foot and at the level of the rearfoot and forefoot areas, misalignments of the pressure centers of each foot, etc. Results: subjects under the age of 13 had the highest number of cases related to the off-centered positioning of the pressure center (C); the groups of those under 13 and over 15 years old located in most cases Pmax at the level of the left retropodal part, and those between 13–15 years old have a location on the dominant leg, at the level of the right retropodal part. The highest numbers of cases of normal bilateral leg are for the group under 13 years, and the other groups have a higher incidence of various plantar imbalances. The analysis of variance (F) identified only two situations in which the independent variable, “age stages,” significantly influences the resulting parameters, at the level of the non-dominant foot: forefoot_left_surface and total_left_surface. The data differences for the right/left pairs within each batch generate insignificant values of |Z| for most cases, with the superiority of the dominant foot parameters for the first two age groups, but in the case of the group over 15 years old, some results are atypical, with higher average values of left/non-dominant foot parameters in the following cases: total_left_Pmax, total_left_Pavg, rearfoot_left_load_percent, rearfoot_left_weight_ratio_percent. The comparison between the data pairs for all three batches (between the forefoot and rearfoot plantar areas) generated significant values of |Z| only for the area of the plantar surfaces. The older the subjects, the more obvious the plantar load on the forefoot area, which is similar to the results of some martial arts studies analyzed here, and is determined by the long use of the non-dominant foot as a support base, during kicks with the dominant one."

Fifteen national and international adolescent swimmers (males = 5; females = 10, 15.5 ± 1.1 years, 170.2 ± 7.5 cm, 60.3 ± 5.7 kg) participated in the study during seven consecutive weeks of the competitive swimming season. The participants received 30 min of nutrition education once per week in a classroom-based setting after they had completed their regular swim training. An undergraduate sports nutrition student delivered all nutrition education sessions and SNK questionnaires were administered to the participants pre- and post-intervention. The mean total SNK score improved by 8.3% (SD = 8.4%, 95% CI = 4.1–12.6; p = 0.006; ES = 1.0) following the nutrition education sessions. On an individual basis, ten swimmers significantly improved their total SNK score, whereas four swimmers did not improve, and one swimmer performed significantly worse after the intervention. Moreover, the swimmers’ knowledge of hydration improved by 22.2% (SD = 20.6%, 95% CI = 11.8–32.6, p = 0.004, ES = 1.1) over the seven-week timeframe, which was the only nutrition topic to have a significantly increased knowledge score. The current study therefore suggests that a nutrition education intervention can positively influence the SNK of highly trained adolescent swimmers."

Eleven players were sampled (using accelerometers and subjective wellness surveys) during the practice ( n = 55) and game ( n = 30) sessions over the 2019 season. Longitudinal data were evaluated for trends across the preseason, non-conference play, and conference play periods. Data were also analyzed with respect to positional groups. Longitudinal analysis of accelerometer data showed higher workload demand during practices than games. Positional group differences were most when evaluating jump count and height. Setters accrued over twice as many jumps in a practice than during a game and had similar overall jump counts in practice to attacking positions. Average team wellness values varied with time in the season, especially during times of congested travel. This is the first study to look at both game and practice workload and wellness measures in collegiate women's volleyball. The results suggest athlete monitoring can be used to understand the demands of volleyball and used in the future to enhance practice and recovery day design to optimize athlete well-being."

Thirty-two male subjects (football players, n = 16; university students, n = 16) completed the IHPT, countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long jump (SLJ), 5 m, 10 m and 20 m sprint tests, randomly across two testing sessions. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between IHPT outputs and athletic performances by accounting for the subjects' athletic background. An independent sample t-test was used to compare the IHPT outputs between groups. Moderate to very strong linear relationships (r2 range: 0.16-0.56) were found between the IHPT and all athletic performances (all p < .026). Percent variance explained by the IHPT outputs after accounting for groups difference was 16%, 56%, 54%, 48% and 40% for CMJ height, SLJ distance, 5 m, 10 m and 20 m sprint performances, respectively. Compared to controls (6.18 ± 0.89 N/kg), football players (10.09 ± 1.57 N/kg) achieved greater IHPT force outputs (p < .001, Hedges' g = 3.2, large ES). The IHPT is clearly correlated to horizontal and vertical athletic performances and can adequately distinguish between athletes and recreationally active controls based on their IHPT results. Future studies should examine the usefulness of the IHPT as a testing tool informing training prescription and performance monitoring practices."

Nine healthy adult habitually strength-training individuals were investigated. Motion analysis and inverse dynamics-based musculoskeletal modelling were used to compute joint loads, muscle forces, and muscle activities. Total exercise load (resultant ground reaction force; rGRF) and the knee-extension net joint moment (NJM) were slightly and considerably greater, respectively, in squat than in leg press (p ≤ 0.04), whereas the hip-extension NJM was moderately greater in leg press than in squat (p = 0.03). Leg press was performed at 11° deeper knee-flexion angle than squat (p = 0.01). Quadriceps muscle activity was similar in squat and leg press. Both exercise modalities showed slightly to moderately greater force in the vastii muscles during the eccentric than concentric phase of a repetition (p ≤ 0.05), indicating eccentric overload. That the quadriceps muscle activity was similar in squat and leg press, while rGRF and NJM about the knee were greater in squat than leg press, may, together with the finding of a propensity to perform leg press at deeper knee angle than squat, suggest that leg press is the preferable leg-extension resistance exercise, both from a training efficacy and injury risk perspective."

However, recent studies have shown that high-level football teams apparently do not apply any HSI prevention protocol. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of preventive strategies and protocols in reducing the incidence of hamstring muscle injuries in professional and semi-professional football teams. A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI/Web of Science and Scopus databases was conducted with the keywords “hamstring* and (injury* or strain) and prevent* and (soccer or football)”. Quality and bias assessment was completed through the Kennelly modified scale. The Injury Incidence Rate (IIR) and the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) were assessed in the statistical analysis. In the meta-analysis, data were extracted, pooled and analysed with “Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.3.070” software. In total, 8 of the 1017 original search studies met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total exposure of the studies was 170,221.8 h, while the number of HSIs recorded was 165 in the intervention groups and 224 in the control groups. The average score of the quality assessment was 23.6/34. The meta-analysis of six of the eight included studies provided strong evidence that interventions are effective in reducing hamstring injuries. The IRR of the effect size was 0.443, with p-value = 0.001. The studies analysed applied different preventive strategies: the Nordic hamstring exercise, the FIFA 11+ programme and exercises for core stability or balance training. All these interventions proved to have a successful effect on prevention of hamstring injuries."

Thirty-two junior tennis players were divided into two groups based on their maximum knee flexion during the preparation phase of serve: Smaller (SKF) and Greater (GKF) Knee Flexion. Their racket velocity, racket height, and knee extension velocity were compared during the tennis serve. Inertial sensors tracked participants’ shank, thigh, and racket motions while performing five first, flat, and valid serves. Knee flexion was analysed during the preparation phase of serve, knee extension velocity after this phase, racket velocity just before ball impact, and racket height at impact. Pre-impact racket velocity (mean difference [MD] = 3.33 km/h, p = 0.004) and the knee extension velocity (MD = 130.30 °/s, p = 0.012) were higher in the GKF than SKF; however, racket impact height was not different between groups (p = 0.236). This study’s findings support the importance of larger knee flexion during the preparation phase of serve-to-serve performance. This motion should be seen as a contributor to racket velocity."

https://openalex.org/W3188586392,Biomechanical Characteristics for Identifying the Cutting Direction of Professional Soccer Players,2021-08-04,2021,article,"(1) Background: To understand the movement characteristics of soccer players when cutting in two directions (45° for the right and left cutting movements) through biomechanical analysis of the lower limbs to identify the cutting direction of the attacker; (2) Methods: A motion analysis system was used to capture the movements of 12 male professional soccer players dribbling to the left and right. Kinematics of the players’ cutting were analyzed, and the paired t-test was used for statistics, with a significant level of α = 0.05; (3) Results: When cutting towards the right, the height of the hip joint during the run-up was low (effect size, ES = 0.41, p = 0.031) at 91.8 ± 7.0 cm. When cutting towards the left, the value was 94.6 ± 6.7 cm. While cutting, the front foot was abducted by 4.3 ± 4.0° at landing when cutting towards the right and adducted by 2.7 ± 5.1° when cutting towards the left (ES = 0.38, p = 0.003); (4) Conclusions: When the attacker carries out the cutting action while approaching the defender, the cutting direction may be predicted by observing the attacker’s hip and foot movements."

They are frequently missed preoperatively due to low MRI sensitivity. The purpose of this article was to describe demographic and anatomical risk factors for ramp lesions, and to identify concomitant lesions and define their characteristics to improve diagnosis of ramp lesions on MRI.Patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction between September 2015 and April 2019 were included in this study. The presence/absence of ramp lesions was recorded in preoperative MRIs and at surgery. Patients' characteristics and clinical findings, concomitant injuries on MRI and the posterior tibial slope were evaluated.One hundred patients (80 male, 20 female) with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.9 years met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of ramp lesions diagnosed at surgery was 16%. Ramp lesions were strongly associated with injuries to the deep MCL (dMCL, p < 0.01), the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL, p < 0.01), and a small medial-lateral tibial slope asymmetry (p < 0.05). There was also good correlation between ramp lesions and bone oedema in the posterior medial tibia plateau (MTP, p < 0.05) and medial femoral condyle (MFC, p < 0.05). A dMCL injury, a smaller differential medial-lateral tibial slope than usual, and the identification of a ramp lesion on MRI increases the likelihood of finding a ramp lesion at surgery. MRI sensitivity was 62.5% and the specificity was 84.5%.The presence on MRI of sMCL and/or dMCL lesions, bone oedema in the posterior MTP and MFC, and a smaller differential medial-lateral tibial slope than usual are highly associated with ramp lesions visible on MRI. Additionally, a dMCL injury, a flatter lateral tibial slope than usual, and the identification of a ramp lesion on MRI increases the likelihood of finding a ramp lesion at surgery. Knowledge of the risk factors and secondary injury signs associated with ramp lesions facilitate the diagnosis of a ramp lesion preoperatively and should raise surgeons' suspicion of this important lesion.Diagnostic study, Level III."

We performed a retrospective review of The National Football League combine test results for all defensive players from 2005-2015 to determine the association of each player's combine test results with career longevity. The position that had the most significant associations for 1-year status was linebackers, with weight, 10-yard dash, 20-yard dash, 40-yard dash, broad jump, 3-cone drill, and shuttle being significantly associated with 1-year roster status. The position that had the most significant associations for 5-year status was cornerbacks, with weight, 10-yard dash, 20-yard dash, 40-yard dash, 3-cone drill, and shuttle being significantly associated with 1-year roster status. The least number of significant associations was found for safeties, with no drill being associated with 1-year roster status and only height and shuttle time significantly associated with 5-year career longevity. Our study demonstrates the utility of the combine results to help estimate the career longevity of NFL defensive players."

We investigated the effects of a 4-week open-skill choice-reaction training intervention on unanticipated jump-landings. Physically active adults ( n = 37; mean age 27, standard deviation 2.7 years, 16 females, 21 males) were randomly allocated to one of two interventions or a control group (CG). Participants in the two intervention groups performed a 4-week visuomotor open skill choice reaction training, one for the upper and one for the lower extremities. Before and after the intervention, two different types of countermovement jumps with landings in split stance position were performed. In the (1) pre-planned condition, we informed the participants regarding the landing position (left or right foot in front position) before the jump. In the (2) unanticipated condition, this information was displayed after take-off (350–600 ms reaction time before landing). Outcomes were landing stability [peak vertical ground reaction force (pGRF) and time to stabilization (TTS)], and landing-related decision-making quality (measured by the number of landing errors). To measure extremity-specific effects, we documented the number of correct hits during the trained drills. A two-factorial (four repeated measures: two conditions, two time factors; three groups) ANCOVA was carried out; conditions = unanticipated versus pre-planned condition, time factors = pre versus post measurement, grouping variable = intervention allocation, co-variates = jumping time and self-report arousal. The training improved performance over the intervention period (upper extremity group: mean of correct choice reaction hits during 5 s drill: +3.0 hits, 95% confidence interval: 2.2–3.9 hits; lower extremity group: +1.6 hits, 0.6–2.6 hits). For pGRF ( F = 8.4, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and landing errors ( F = 17.1, p &amp;lt; 0.001) repeated measures effect occurred. Significantly more landing errors occurred within the unanticipated condition for all groups and measurement days. The effect in pGRF is mostly impacted by between-condition differences in the CG. No between-group or interaction effect was seen for these outcomes: pGRF ( F = 0.4, p = 0.9; F = 2.3, p = 0.1) landing errors ( F = 0.5, p = 0.6; F = 2.3, p = 0.1). TTS displayed a repeated measures ( F = 4.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001, worse values under the unanticipated condition, improvement over time) and an interaction effect ( F = 2.4, p = 0.03). Healthy adults can improve their choice reaction task performance by training. As almost no transfer to unanticipated landing successfulness or movement quality occurred, the effect seems to be task-specific. Lower-extremity reactions to unanticipated stimuli may be improved by more specific training regimens."

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology and arthroscopic minimally invasive technology, arthroscopic meniscus plasty and perovskite nanobiomaterial repair have gradually replaced the previous open meniscus surgery of the knee joint and has become the main method of meniscus injury treatment, and the perovskite nanobiomaterial repair technique that incorporates artificial intelligence technology is also gradually being applied. Therefore, this article studies the role of perovskite nanobiomaterials in the repair of meniscus injuries in football sports and analyzes the biological characteristics of the inner and outer meniscus to provide help to improve the healing rate of meniscus injuries. The study selected six male meniscus-injured patients (meniscus injuries caused by football sports) and obtained six injured menisci. The same cross section of the same part of the meniscus was analyzed inside and outside the meniscus. At the same time, a meniscal injury step was performed on the patient. The biological characteristics of perovskite nano-biomaterials in the repair of meniscus injuries in football sports were compared and analyzed, and the patient's gait before and after surgery was also compared. Experiments have shown that the percentage of the postoperative support phase of the affected limb is significantly higher than that before surgery (P < 0.05), the percentage of the postoperative support phase and flatfoot phase decreased compared with that before surgery, and the gait cycle parameters of both lower extremities improved after surgery, obviously (P < 0.05). It explains that the arthroscopic repair of perovskite nanobiomaterials combined with the artificial intelligence technology to repair the meniscus anterior angle injury is simple and does not require special equipment, has fewer complications, is safe and reliable, and has a high clinical healing rate and a high patient satisfaction rate after surgery. The curative effect is significant; artificial intelligence technology and the application of perovskite nanobiomaterials provide more possibilities for meniscus repair."

The MBboard consists of an artificial small climbing hold affixed to a wooden board, which is connected to any cable-motion strength equipment to determine the maximum dynamic strength (MBboard-1RM). Ten male rock climbers (Rock Climbing Group, RCG = 10) and ten physically active men (Control Group, CG = 10) performed, on three separate occasions, a familiarization session with procedures adopted during MBboard-1RM testing and two experimental trials (i.e., test and retest) to determine the construct validity and reliability of the MBboard during unilateral seated cable row exercise. In the first trial, the electromyographic activity (EMG) was recorded from the flexor digitorum superficialis. The self-reported climbing ability was also recorded. The RCG had superior performance (i.e. 37.5%) and EMG activity (i.e. 51%) in MBboard-1RM testing when compared with the CG (p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the MBboard-1RM results and climbing ability (r &gt; 0.72, p &lt; 0.05). Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis revealed good reliability within trials (ICC &gt; 0.79, p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that the MBboard is a valid and reliable tool to assess rock climbing-specific maximal strength. The validity of MBboard-1RM appears to be related to the finger flexor muscles activation, probably reflecting the specific adaptations resulting from long-term practice of this sport discipline."

This manuscript presents the treatment and rehabilitation of professional soccer players who had acute fractures of the 5th metatarsal bone and a cannulated screw fixation. The main purpose of the analysis was to determine the minimum time necessary for a permanent return to the sport after a 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; metatarsal fracture among professional soccer players. We followed the surgical and rehabilitation path of 21 professional soccer players from the Polish League (I&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and II&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; divisions) who suffered from the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; metatarsal bone fracture. All players underwent standard percutaneous internal fixation with the use of cannulated screws. The total inability to play lasted for 9.2 (± 1.86) weeks among players treated only surgically (n = 10), 17.5 (± 2.5) weeks in the conservative and later surgery group, excluding players with nonunion (n = 6), and 24.5 (± 10.5) weeks for nonunion and switch treatment (n = 4) players. Prompt fracture stabilization surgery is recommended for athletes, enabling the implementation of an aggressive rehabilitation protocol as soon as possible. Early limb loading after surgery (from week 2) does not delay fracture healing or hinder the bone union, thus rehabilitation plays a crucial role in shortening the time of RTP (return to play) and is obligatory for each athlete who undergoes surgical treatment."

From a marketing perspective this is may be addressed through brand DNA, from engineering through modularization. The design perspective (merging those two) has been ill-explored, particularly from professional designers. Previously we proposed a theoretical model describing different industrial design projects and how they influence industrial designers strategic thinking. It was developed through literature reviews and examples found in manufacturing industry. Through a multi-case interview study with 16 participants from five manufacturing companies with strong brands, this article aims to empirically evaluate the proposed model. The results show that the respondents could describe all but one industrial design projects, the cause maybe that they had not been exposed to saving a company by doing a total makeover."

Using a prospective cohort design, 42 male collegiate rugby players with a previous history of traumatic intracapsular knee joint injury and 124 players without knee injury history were included in this study. Ultrasonography assessments of anterior femoral cartilage were performed before (pre-season) and following a 5-month athletic season (post-season). Rugby players with a history of traumatic knee joint injury had greater lateral condylar thickness (2.37 ± 0.35 mm, p = 0.03), intercondylar thickness (2.51 ± 0.47 mm, p = 0.03), and partial area (44.67 ± 7.28mm 2 , p = 0.02) compared to control players (lateral = 2.23 ± 0.35 mm, intercondylar = 2.32 ± 0.47 mm, partial area = 41.60 ± 7.26 mm 2 ), regardless of pre-and post-season assessment time points. Pre-season ultrasonography assessment of lateral condylar thickness (2.34 ± 0.47 mm, p = 0.02), medial condylar thickness (2.05 ± 0.43 mm, p = 0.03), and partial area (44.10 ± 9.23 mm 2 , p = 0.001) were significantly greater than the post-season ultrasonography assessment time point (lateral = 2.26 ± 0.43 mm, medial = 1.98 ± 0.43 mm, partial area = 42.17 ± 8.82 mm 2 ), regardless of group membership. Rugby players with a history of intracapsular knee joint injury displayed altered anterior femoral cartilage size via ultrasonography assessments. Regardless of a presence of injury history, collegiate rugby players showed a decrease in cartilage thickness and partial area following a 5-month competitive season."
https://openalex.org/W3186118968,Reward-dependent selection of feedback gains impacts rapid motor decisions,2021-07-26,2021,preprint,"Abstract Target reward influences motor planning strategies through modulation of movement vigor. Considering current theories of sensorimotor control suggesting that movement planning consists in selecting a goal-directed control strategy, we sought to investigate the influence of reward on feedback control. Here we explored this question in three human reaching experiments. First, we altered the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in feedback gains for higher target rewards, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, we investigated whether the differences in target rewards across multiple goals impacted rapid motor decisions during movement. We observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and, surprisingly, the feedback gains at perturbation onset: the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of the feedback gains on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity. Together, our results demonstrate an impact of target reward on feedback control and highlight the competition between movement vigor and flexibility. Significance statement Humans can modulate their movement vigor based on the expected reward. However, a potential influence of reward on feedback control has not been documented. Here we investigated reaching control strategies in different contexts associated with explicit rewards for one or multiple goals, while exposed to external perturbations. We report two strategies: reward could either increase feedback gains, or promote flexible switches between goals. The engagement of peripheral circuits in the modulation of feedback gains was confirmed by the application of a background load that biased feedback vigor directionally, evoking differences in switching behavior in the opposite direction. We conclude that feedback vigor and flexible changes in goal are two competing mechanisms to be selected when interacting with a dynamic environment."

The single leg, medial countermovement jump provides objective measures of frontal plane force, velocity and power, and is relevant for ice hockey players given the similar lateral movement to ice skating. This study measured normative single leg, medial countermovement jump parameters (i.e., vertical and lateral maximum force, average concentric power and average concentric power during the last 100 ms) amongst male youth ice hockey players and assessed interlimb asymmetry in these healthy athletes. Ninety-one elite youth players participated in the study. Participants completed three right and three left jumps. Non-parametric tests were performed to evaluate between-jump and between-group comparisons. Many differences in jump force and power parameters were observed between the 10U/11U and 12U/13U age groups, and the 12U/13U and 14U/15U age groups, but differences were not as consistent between older or younger players. The average asymmetry index for each age group was less than 15% for force parameters, while the power parameters had larger asymmetry indices (between 9% and 22%). Our results provide age-specific reference values and asymmetry indices for male elite youth ice hockey players aged 10–18 years performing the single leg, medial countermovement jump."

The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a framework for professional practice in applied performance analysis (PA) which identifies the components of practice and the expertise underpinning it.A six-step framework analysis was conducted: (1) An initial conceptual framework was devised based on well-accepted components of applied practice; (2) A systematic review identified 90 papers relating to applied PA practice; (3) Papers were coded to the initial framework and additional themes recorded; (4) Themes were analysed and synthesised to construct a draft framework; (5) This draft was validated by surveying 24 experienced applied performance analysts and academic experts; (6) A revised framework is reported based on stakeholder engagement feedback.Nine components of practice were identified; establishing relationships and defining roles, needs analysis and service planning, system design, data collection and reliability checking, data management, analysis, reporting to key stakeholders, facilitation of feedback to athletes and service review and evaluation. Our evidence suggests that applied PA practice is underpinned by five areas of expertise: contextual awareness, building relationships, performance analysis and sporting expertise, technical expertise and professional behaviours."

A cohort study on data from the Malmö Youth Sport Study",2021-07-23,2021,article,"Abstract Background Studies investigating postural orientation in uninjured youth athletes are scarce. Understanding how postural orientation during functional performance tests change with age in uninjured athletes has the potential to enhance awareness of changes in performance after injury and to set realistic goals for injured athletes. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore postural orientation during functional tasks at early adolescence, and changes in postural orientation from early to middle adolescence and relate this to sex, type of sport and right leg lean body mass (RLLBM). Methods In this cohort study 144 (38% female) youth athletes (mean age 13.5 years, SD 0.3) were included at baseline and 86 of these at follow up 2 years later. Four functional performance tests were visually evaluated for Postural Orientation Errors (POEs) with an ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (good) to 2 (poor), yielding a maximum total POE score of 51, and RLLBM by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Improvements were observed in the total POE score from baseline to follow-up, median difference − 10 and − 7 ( p &lt; 0.001) for female and male athletes, respectively. At follow-up, female athletes had lower total POE score (median 18) than males (median 24) ( p = 0.01). There were no differences in POE scores between sports type (team, individual, aesthetic) ( p = 0.20–0.98) and no relationship between total POE score and RLLBM (r s = 0.09, p = 0.42). Conclusions POEs appear to be quite common in young athletic population, but improvements are achieved over time. At mid-adolescence, female athletes seem to have less POEs than males. Neither sport type nor RLLBM seem to influence postural orientation."

We searched three electronic databases (CrossRef, Google Scholar, and PubMed), using the following inclusion criteria for selecting research studies: (a) healthy male and female participants aged 8-18 years who were engaged in organized sports; (b) interventions up to 16-weeks duration; (c) incorporation of a control group; and (d) interventions that utilized only exercises using participants’ body mass. We calculated pooled estimates of effect sizes (standardized mean difference) for changes in motor control across nine studies (12 comparisons) using the inverse-variance random effects model for meta-analyses and 95% confidence intervals. Among the nine studies included in our meta-analysis, there was a moderate, significant effect in favor of neuromuscular training programs (0.79 [95% CI: 0.38, 1.20], Z = 3.76 [ p = 0.0002]) on motor control. Heterogeneity was high and significant ( I 2 = 77% [ p = 0.00001]). Moderator analyses for age and stature revealed NMT programs to be more effective in younger, shorter, and lighter individuals. We found larger effect sizes in males, and for programs &gt;8 weeks in duration. We concluded that the older and heavier an individual is, the less effective bodyweight-only NMT programs became, particularly for female participants. These results reinforce the notion that exercise to enhance motor control should be emphasized during pre-adolescence."

https://openalex.org/W3184396738,Fatigue Testing of Wearable Sensing Technologies: Issues and Opportunities,2021-07-21,2021,review,"Standards for the fatigue testing of wearable sensing technologies are lacking. The majority of published fatigue tests for wearable sensors are performed on proof-of-concept stretch sensors fabricated from a variety of materials. Due to their flexibility and stretchability, polymers are often used in the fabrication of wearable sensors. Other materials, including textiles, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conductive metals or inks, may be used in conjunction with polymers to fabricate wearable sensors. Depending on the combination of the materials used, the fatigue behaviors of wearable sensors can vary. Additionally, fatigue testing methodologies for the sensors also vary, with most tests focusing only on the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) regime, and few sensors are cycled until failure or runout are achieved. Fatigue life predictions of wearable sensors are also lacking. These issues make direct comparisons of wearable sensors difficult. To facilitate direct comparisons of wearable sensors and to move proof-of-concept sensors from ""bench to bedside"", fatigue testing standards should be established. Further, both high-cycle fatigue (HCF) and failure data are needed to determine the appropriateness in the use, modification, development, and validation of fatigue life prediction models and to further the understanding of how cracks initiate and propagate in wearable sensing technologies."

Without meaningful and relevant comparisons, results can be difficult to interpret, effect sizes may be unduly minimised or exaggerated, and any resulting recommendations for practice could be called into question. Despite recognition of the importance of control groups in study design, however, there is currently limited guidance for sport-related research with regard to the selection and design of comparison groups. Furthermore, we have become increasingly concerned with the recurrent use of comparison groups, particularly in motor learning and control studies, that may initially appear well designed in experimental terms but ultimately possess limited relevance to—and in turn limited utility for informing—applied practice. To address these issues, we first set forth and discuss the primary types of control groups available for sport research, which include no-treatment, placebo or alternative-task, variable-delivery and active-treatment groups. We then present seven key principles to consider—upon identifying the appropriate type of control—in order to maximise internal validity, enhance interpretability and best inform real-world practice for sport psychology and motor learning and development. It is intended that the principles and recommendations detailed herein could support sport-related study design to the benefit of researchers and applied practitioners alike."

This study aims to improve the skills of dribbling SSB TMM players in the city of Medan, North Sumatra Province by using coordination training and agility training. The experimental population was all SSB TMM players with a sample of 22 people. The research method used is descriptive with a correlational process, the analysis system is used to test the hypothesis which is the normality test, linearity test, and correlation test. From the end of the first hypothesis correlation test, a significance value of 0.046 &lt;0.050 is obtained, so there is a significant relationship between coordination on the results of the ability of dribbling ball. The achievement of the second hypothesis test has a significance value of 0.037 &lt;0.05, so there is a significant relationship between agility and the results of the ability to dribble a ball.

The rise in digital wearables for remote healthcare is evolving at an increasing pace towards patient-centred and personalised care with connected patients. This transformation is creating new opportunities for designers to increase patients' participation and sustain their engagement in remote healthcare. In this paper, the authors have investigated the role of gender in aesthetic design in the context of digital health wearables to enhance user engagement and interaction. The investigations were conducted through participatory design sessions and showed a constructive relationship between aesthetic preferences and understanding the influence of gender as a means of facilitating user engagement with digital health wearables. This paper presents a novel user response model that leads to suggestions for future work, including research in the areas of gender awareness in aesthetics to move beyond traditional, stereotypical, and pre-identified gendered characteristics related to femininity and masculinity.

This study assessed the lower limb joint moments and muscle responses to split-belt treadmill perturbations in two groups (14 healthy young group [23.36 ± 2.90 years] and 14 healthy older group [70.93 ± 4.36 years]) who performed two trials of unexpected split-belt treadmill perturbations while walking on a programmable split-belt treadmill. A motion capture system quantified the lower limb joint moments, and a wireless electromyography system recorded the lower limb muscle responses. The compensatory limb's (i.e., the tripped limb's contralateral side) joint moments and muscle responses were computed during the pre-perturbation period (the five gait cycles before the onset of a split-belt treadmill perturbation) and the recovery period (from the split-belt treadmill perturbation to the baseline gait relying on the ground reaction forces' profile). Joint moments were assessed by maximum joint moments, and muscle responses were quantified by the normalization (%) and co-contraction index (CCI). Joint moments and muscle responses of the compensatory limb during the recovery period were significantly higher for the YG than the OG, and joint moments (e.g., knee flexion and extension and hip flexion moments) and muscle responses during the recovery period were higher compared to the pre-perturbation period for both groups. For CCI, the older group showed significantly higher co-contraction for biceps femoris/rectus femoris muscles than the young group during the recovery period. For both groups, co-contraction for biceps femoris/rectus femoris muscles was higher during the pre-perturbation period than the recovery period. The study confirmed that older adults compensated for muscle weakness by using lower joint moments and muscle activations and increasing muscle co-contractions to recover balance after split-belt treadmill perturbations. A better understanding of the recovery mechanisms of older adults who train on fall-inducing systems could improve therapeutic regimens."

General performance outcomes such as jump height or peak measures have been used to assess SSC function in youth populations; however, these discrete metrics fail to provide insight into temporal jump-landing characteristics. This study assessed DVJ force-time profiles in 1013 middle and high-school female athletes (n = 279 prepubertal, n = 401 pubertal, and n = 333 postpubertal). Maturity status was determined using the Pubertal Maturation Observation Scale. Ground reaction force data were analyzed to extract a range of variables to characterize force-time profiles. SSC function was categorized as poor, moderate, or good dependent on the presence of an impact peak and spring-like behavior. No differences in jump height or ground contact time were observed between maturity groups (p > 0.05). Significant differences in absolute peak landing and take-off force were evident between all maturational statuses (p < 0.05). Relative to bodyweight normalized forces, only peak take-off force was significantly different between prepubertal and postpubertal groups (p < 0.05; d = 0.22). Spring-like behavior showed small improvements from pubertal to postpubertal (p < 0.05; d = 0.25). Most females displayed poor SSC function at prepubertal (79.6%), pubertal (77.3%), and postpubertal (65.5%) stages of maturity. Large increases in absolute forces occur throughout maturation in female athletes; however, only small maturational differences were found in relative force or spring-like behavior. Consequently, most girls display poor SSC function irrespective of maturity."

This study aimed to evaluate the most accurate field method to predict BF% in Olympic wrestlers compared to BF% estimated by air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Sixty-one male (body mass 72.4 ± 13.5 kg; height 170.3 ± 7.0 cm; body mass index (BMI) 24.9 ± 3.5 kg.m−2; BF% 8.5 ± 4.9%) and twenty-five female wrestlers (body mass 60.3 ± 9.9 kg; height 161.3 ± 7.1 cm; BMI 23.1 ± 2.5 kg.m−2; BF% 18.7 ± 4.7%) undertook body composition assessments including ADP and nine-site skinfold measurements. Correlations, bias, limits of agreement, and standardized differences between alterations in BF% measured by ADP and other prediction equations were evaluated to validate measures, and multiple regression analyses to develop an Olympic wrestlers-specific prediction formula. The Stewart and Hannan equation for male wrestlers and the Durnin and Womersley equation for female wrestlers provided the most accurate BF% compared to the measured BF% by ADP, with the lowest bias and presented no significant differences between the measured and predicted BF%. A new prediction equation was developed using only abdominal skinfold and sex as variables, predicting 83.2% of the variance. The findings suggest the use of the new wrestler-specific prediction equation proposed in the study as a valid and accurate alternative to ADP to quantify BF% among Olympic wrestlers."

The purpose of this study was to determine how various cognitive tasks influenced dual-task jump-landing performance along with how individuals' baseline cognitive ability mediated these relationships. Forty female recreational soccer and basketball players completed baseline cognitive function assessments and dual-task jump landings. The baseline cognitive assessments quantified individual processing speed, multitasking, attentional control, and primary memory ability. Dual-task conditions for the jump landing included unanticipated and anticipated jump performance, with and without concurrent working memory and captured visual attention tasks. Knee kinematics and kinetics were acquired through motion capture and ground reaction force data. Jumping conditions that directed visual attention away from the landing, whether anticipated or unanticipated, were associated with decreased peak knee flexion angle (P < .001). No interactions between cognitive function measures and jump-landing conditions were observed for any of the biomechanical variables, suggesting that injury-relevant cognitive-motor relationships may be specific to secondary task demands and movement requirements. This work provides insight into group- and subject-specific effects of established anticipatory and novel working memory dual-task paradigms on the neuromuscular control of a sport-specific movement."

Patients with high- and even low-grade acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries often present with pain, deformity, and expectations of returning to normal. Most AC injuries are best treated symptomatically with or without physical therapy, while some may benefit from operative intervention, either acutely or secondarily. Low-quality evidence supports the use of hook plates as a biomechanically sound option for early AC joint reduction in high-grade AC separations but almost universally require removal of hardware due to symptomatology. Anatomic reconstruction with tendon autograft is biomechanically superior to suture button, Weaver–Dunn, and nonanatomic graft. Anatomic reconstruction with tendon autograft is associated with up to a 10% distal clavicle fracture rate. The chapter also provides recommendations for implementing evidence-based practice in the clinical setting."

Despite its ecological importance, we do not have a unified theoretical account of non-straight-line human movement. Here, we present a unified optimality criterion that predicts disparate non-straight-line walking phenomena, with straight-line walking as a special case. We first characterized the metabolic cost of turning, deriving the cost landscape as a function of turning radius and rate. We then generalized this cost landscape to arbitrarily complex trajectories, allowing the velocity direction to deviate from body orientation (holonomic walking). We used this generalized optimality criterion to mathematically predict movement patterns in multiple contexts of varying complexity: walking on prescribed paths, turning in place, navigating an angled corridor, navigating freely with end-point constraints, walking through doors, and navigating around obstacles. In these tasks, humans moved at speeds and paths predicted by our optimality criterion, slowing down to turn and never using sharp turns. We show that the shortest path between two points is, counterintuitively, often not energy optimal, and indeed, humans do not use the shortest path in such cases. Thus, we have obtained a unified theoretical account that predicts human walking paths and speeds in diverse contexts. Our model focuses on walking in healthy adults; future work could generalize this model to other human populations, other animals, and other locomotor tasks."

Linear mixed models and repeated measurement correlations were used to assess changes over time and common within participant associations between hamstring contractile properties and peak knee extension during the final part of the swing phase, peak hip flexion, peak combined knee extension and hip flexion, and peak joint angular velocities, respectively.Hamstring MVT and sprint performance were significantly reduced by 7.5% and 14.3% at the end of the football match simulation. Unexpectedly, there were no indications for reductions in RTD when MVT decrease was considered. Decreases in hamstring MVT were significantly correlated to decreases in peak knee angle (R = 0.342) and to increases in the peak combined angle (R = -0.251).During a football match simulation, maximal voluntary isometric hamstring torque declines. This decline is related to greater peak knee extension and peak combined angle during sprint running, which indicates a reduced capacity of the hamstrings to decelerate the lower leg during sprint running with fatigue."

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore leg dependent patterns of cortical contributions to postural control in patients 6 weeks following ACLR. A total of 12 patients after ACLR (25.1 ± 3.2 years, 178.1 ± 9.7 cm, 77.5 ± 14.4 kg) and another 12 gender, age, and activity matched healthy controls participated in this study. All subjects performed 10 × 30 s. single leg stances on each leg, equipped with 64-channel mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Postural stability was quantified by area of sway and sway velocity. Estimations of the weighted phase lag index were conducted as a cortical measure of functional connectivity. The findings showed significant group × leg interactions for increased functional connectivity in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injured leg, predominantly including fronto−parietal [ F (1, 22) = 8.41, p ≤ 0.008, η 2 = 0.28], fronto−occipital [ F (1, 22) = 4.43, p ≤ 0.047, η 2 = 0.17], parieto−motor [ F (1, 22) = 10.30, p ≤ 0.004, η 2 = 0.32], occipito−motor [ F (1, 22) = 5.21, p ≤ 0.032, η 2 = 0.19], and occipito−parietal [ F (1, 22) = 4.60, p ≤ 0.043, η 2 = 0.17] intra−hemispherical connections in the contralateral hemisphere and occipito−motor [ F (1, 22) = 7.33, p ≤ 0.013, η 2 = 0.25] on the ipsilateral hemisphere to the injured leg. Higher functional connectivity in patients after ACLR, attained by increased emphasis of functional connections incorporating the somatosensory and visual areas, may serve as a compensatory mechanism to control postural stability of the injured leg in the early phase of rehabilitation. These preliminary results may help to develop new neurophysiological assessments for detecting functional deficiencies after ACLR in the future."

Four online databases including PudMed, ESCSOhost, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus were searched according to different combination of keywords. 954 articles were extracted from databases, and ultimately 15 articles were included in this study after removal of duplicate and articles screening according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were adopted when appropriate and Egger’s regression symmetry was adopted to assess the publication bias and the results were presented with forest plots and funnel plots respectively. Fifteen articles studied the effects of strength and resistance, core, and plyometric trainings. The quality of the investigation was assessed by the checklist developed by Downs and Black. Most of the investigations found out that training programs were beneficial to front crawl sprinting swimming performance, stroke biomechanics, force, and muscle strength. First, strength and resistance trainings and core trainings were effective on sprinting performance enhancement. Second, resistance trainings were found to have positive effects on stroke rate. Plyometric trainings were beneficial to start performance, while there was no sufficient evidence for confirming the positive improvement on turn biomechanical, also overall swimming performance, after weeks of plyometric trainings. Strength and Conditioning trainings are suggested to implement in regular training regime regarding to the positive effects on swimming performance, including starts, turns and front crawl swim, and relevant biomechanical parameters, instead of swimming training only. Further research with higher quality is recommended to conduct and more investigations on the training effects to other stroke styles are also suggested."

However, limited research has quantitatively assessed youth flag football head impact biomechanics. Purpose: To describe head impact biomechanics outcomes in youth flag football and explore factors associated with head impact magnitudes. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We monitored 52 player-seasons among 48 male flag football players (mean ± SD; age, 9.4 ± 1.1 years; height, 138.6 ± 9.5 cm; mass, 34.7 ± 9.2 kg) across 3 seasons using head impact sensors during practices and games. Sensors recorded head impact frequencies, peak linear ( g) and rotational (rad/s 2 ) acceleration, and estimated impact location. Impact rates (IRs) were calculated as 1 impact per 10 player-exposures; IR ratios (IRRs) were used to compare season, event type, and age group IRs; and 95% CIs were calculated for IRs and IRRs. Weekly and seasonal cumulative head impact frequencies and magnitudes were calculated. Mixed-model regression models examined the association between player characteristics, event type, and seasons and peak linear and rotational accelerations. Results: A total of 429 head impacts from 604 exposures occurred across the study period (IR, 7.10; 95% CI, 4.81-10.50). Weekly and seasonal cumulative median head impact frequencies were 1.00 (range, 0-2.63) and 7.50 (range, 0-21.00), respectively. The most frequent estimated head impact locations were the skull base (n = 96; 22.4%), top of the head (n = 74; 17.2%), and back of the head (n = 66; 15.4%). The combined event type IRs differed among the 3 seasons (IRR range, 1.45-2.68). Games produced greater IRs (IRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53) and peak linear acceleration (mean difference, 5.69 g; P = .008) than did practices. Older players demonstrated greater combined event–type IRs (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.90) and increased head impact magnitudes than did younger players, with every 1-year age increase associated with a 3.78 g and 602.81-rad/s 2 increase in peak linear and rotational acceleration magnitude, respectively ( P≤ .005). Conclusion: Head IRs and magnitudes varied across seasons, thus highlighting multiple season and cohort data are valuable when providing estimates. Head IRs were relatively low across seasons, while linear and rotational acceleration magnitudes were relatively high."

Thestructure of the foot is essential to the ability to balance, but findings from studies comparing balance of children with and without flatfoot have been equivocal. We investigated the prevalence of flatfoot among school children in Ibadan, Nigeria, and compared selected balance indices in participants with and without flatfoot. Participants in this cross-sectional study were 300 junior secondary school students (aged 10–14 years). The navicular drop test, single limb stance test and tandem walk test were used to assess the presence of flatfoot, and static balance and dynamic balance, respectively. Data were summarised using percentages, mean and SD and, analysed with independent t-tests and chi-squared tests. The prevalence of flatfoot was 39.7%, and while higher in boys (44.7%) than girls (34.9%), this was not significantly different. Participants with flatfoot had significantly poorer mean static balance measures than those who did not (right: 25.70 [SD 6.55] vs 27.89 [SD 4.92]; left: 26.21 [SD 6.01] vs 28.52 [SD 4.27]), but there was no significant difference in dynamic balance between the groups. When treating children with flatfoot, physiotherapists may consider measuring static balance and, where appropriate, incorporate balance activities as part of the overall management plan."

Meniscal tissue is susceptible to injury and cannot heal spontaneously from most pathologies, especially considering the limited regenerative capacity of the inner avascular region. Conventional clinical treatments span from conservative therapy to meniscus implantation, all with limitations. There have been advances in meniscal tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in terms of potential combinations of polymeric biomaterials, endogenous cells and stimuli, resulting in innovative strategies. Recently, polymeric scaffolds have provided researchers with a powerful instrument to rationally support the requirements for meniscal tissue regeneration, ranging from an ideal architecture to biocompatibility and bioactivity. However, multiple challenges involving the anisotropic structure, sophisticated regenerative process, and challenging healing environment of the meniscus still create barriers to clinical application. Advances in scaffold manufacturing technology, temporal regulation of molecular signaling and investigation of host immunoresponses to scaffolds in tissue engineering provide alternative strategies, and studies have shed light on this field. Accordingly, this review aims to summarize the current polymers used to fabricate meniscal scaffolds and their applications in vivo and in vitro to evaluate their potential utility in meniscal tissue engineering. Recent progress on combinations of two or more types of polymers is described, with a focus on advanced strategies associated with technologies and immune compatibility and tunability. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects for regenerating injured meniscal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3181697134,Core bone diameter in an organic implant-less technique affecting the biomechanical properties of the anterior cruciate ligament fixation; an in-vitro study,2021-07-13,2021,preprint,"Abstract Background Bone and site hold tendon inside (BASHTI) is an implant-less technique that can solve some of the problems associated with other anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive methods. This study aims to investigate the effect of core bone diameter variation on the biomechanical properties of a reconstructed ACL using BASHTI technique. Methods A number of 15 laboratory samples of reconstructed ACL were built using bovine digital tendons and Sawbones blocks. Samples were divided into three groups with different core bone diameters of 8 mm, 8.5 mm, and 9 mm. The double-stranded tendon size and bone tunnel diameter were 8 mm and 10 mm, respectively. A loading scenario consisting of two cyclic loadings followed by a single cycle pull-out loading was applied to the samples simulating the after-surgery loading conditions to observe the fixation strength. Results Results showed that the core bone diameter had a significant effect on the failure mode of the samples ( P = 0.006) and their fixation strength ( P &lt; 0.001). Also, it was observed that the engaging length and the average cyclic stiffness (ACS) of them were influenced by the core bone diameter significantly (engaging length: P = 0.001, ACS: P = 0.007), but its effect on the average pull-out stiffness was not significant ( P = 0.053). Conclusions It was concluded that core bone diameter variation has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of ACL reconstruction when BASHTI technique is used, and it should be noted for surgeons who use BASHTI technique. Abstract Figure Highlights A new implant-less technique was used to reconstruct anterior cruciate ligament. Artificial bone and fresh animal soft tissue used to simulate the fixation process. Loading condition were carefully chosen to simulate the post-operation. Components geometry had direct effect on biomechanical properties of the fixation.

A Systematic Review,2021-07-09,2021,review,"To determine whether the use of suture tape augmentation (ST) would lead to improved clinical outcomes, increased stability, shorter postoperative immobilization, and earlier return to activity and sports compared with Broström repair (BR) in surgical treatment of chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI).A systematic literature search was performed using Pubmed and Embase according to PRISMA guidelines. The following search terms were used: ankle instability, suture tape, fiber tape, and internal brace. Full-text articles in English that directly compared BR and ST cohorts were included, with a minimum cohort size of 40 patients. Exclusion criteria were former systematic reviews, biomechanical studies, and case reports.Ultimately, 7 clinical trials were included in this systematic review. Regarding the clinical and radiologic outcomes and complication rates, no major differences were detected between groups. Recurrence of instability and revision surgeries tended to occur more often after BR, whereas irritation of the peroneal nerve and tendons seemed to occur more frequently after ST. Postoperative rehabilitation protocols were either the same for both groups or more aggressive in the ST groups. When both techniques were performed with arthroscopic assistance, return to sports was significantly faster in the ST groups.In conclusion, suture tape augmentation showed excellent results and is a safe technique comparable to traditional Broström repair. No major differences regarding clinical and radiologic outcomes or complications were found.III, systematic review of level I, II, and III studies."

Athletes younger than 25 years who return to sports have a second injury rate of 23%. There may be a mismatch between rehabilitation contents and the demands an athlete faces after returning to sports. Current return-to-sports (RTS) tests utilize closed and predictable motor skills; however, demands on the field are different. Neurocognitive functions are essential to manage dynamic sport situations and may fluctuate after peripheral injuries. Most RTS and rehabilitation paradigms appear to lack this aspect, which might be linked to increased risk of second injury. Objective: This systematic and scoping review aims to map existing evidence about neurocognitive and neurophysiological functions in athletes, which could be linked to ACL injury in an integrated fashion and bring an extensive perspective to assessment and rehabilitation approaches. Data Sources: PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched to identify relevant studies published between 2005 and 2020 using the keywords ACL, brain, cortical, neuroplasticity, cognitive, cognition, neurocognition, and athletes. Study Selection: Studies investigating either neurocognitive or neurophysiological functions in athletes and linking these to ACL injury regardless of their design and technique were included. Study Design: Systematic review. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Data Extraction: The demographic, temporal, neurological, and behavioral data revealing possible injury-related aspects were extracted and summarized. Results: A total of 16 studies were included in this review. Deficits in different neurocognitive domains and changes in neurophysiological functions could be a predisposing risk factor for, or a consequence caused by, ACL injuries. Conclusion: Clinicians should view ACL injuries not only as a musculoskeletal but also as a neural lesion with neurocognitive and neurophysiological aspects. Rehabilitation and RTS paradigms should consider these changes for assessment and interventions after injury."

The helmet technology has been constantly improved, and it is driven by market competition, medical records, coaches and athletes' self-awareness. With finite element analysis and computational resources development, it is possible to develop more accurate brain models to recreate American Footballers' head impacts. This method seems to be an excellent simulation tool to verify the helmet's ability to absorb energy and enable the researchers to have an insight into head kinematics and tissue-level injuries. The work is focused on head injuries in American Football as the sport becomes more popular across the globe. Additionally, a reference to the development and newest technology is presented. The review's proposed approach gathers studies presented within the last decade regarding the coupling of finite element brain models with helmets in standardised or on-field conditions. The synthesis of the existing state of the art may enhance the researchers to continue investigating the athlete's trauma and improve the protective gear technology to minimise head injuries. The authors presented numerous studies regarding concussions and the newest findings from the last decade, including Finite Element Head models (FEHm) with American Football helmet simulations.

https://openalex.org/W3182767281,Injury risk among athletes on artificial turf: a review of current literature,2021-07-08,2021,review,"Artificial turf is used commonly as an alternative to natural grass for athletic playing surfaces, primarily for its ease of maintenance, multi-use capability year-round, and cost. Prior studies have demonstrated increased biomechanical stresses at the shoe-surface interface on artificial turf when compared to natural grass. However, there is debate whether the altered shoe-surface interface confers additional risk for injury to athletes. The purpose of this study was to review the current literature on injury risk associated with artificial turf among various sports played on turf. The present study was a clinical review of the current literature regarding injury risk on artificial and natural turf. While playing surface generally does not appear to impact overall injury risk in soccer and rugby players, data is inconclusive among American football athletes. Lower-extremity injuries, in particular knee and ankle injuries, more commonly occur on artificial turf in comparison to natural grass. Surface and sport-specific shoes, third-generation artificial turf, and routine monitoring and maintenance have all been shown to reduce the risk of injury on artificial turf. When athletes must play on artificial turf, surface-specific strategies may be implemented to reduce their risk of injury. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate further these risk reduction strategies. Level of Evidence: Level V."

It is considered to be the principal cause in up to 40% of low back pain cases. In literature, it emerges that the “fascia”, by its anatomical continuity, if altered or densified in different regions of the body with respect to the sacroiliac joint and its surroundings, may have a fundamental role in the genesis of SIJD and low back pain. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating a single session of Fascial Manipulation®-Stecco method®, treating the muscular fasciae at distance from the painful region. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with acute and chronic sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) were recruited (16 males and 4 females, mean age of 46.6 ± 12.98 years). Patients underwent a predefined assessment protocol, followed by an evaluation of myofascial pain and subsequent manipulation of the fascia at points at least 20 cm away from the posterior inferior iliac spines (PIIS). Each patient underwent three pain evaluations: pre-treatment (t0), post-treatment (t1), and at a 1-month follow-up (t2). For the evaluation in t0, t1 the numerical rating scale (NRS) for the intensity of pain and the algometer for the pain threshold at the PIIS were used; in t2 only the NRS scale. Results: The results obtained by comparing the algometer measurements with the NRS values between t0 and t1 were in both cases statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas the comparison between the NRS values at t1 and at t2 was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: A single Fascial Manipulation treatment, even when applied at least 20 cm from the PIIS, can potentially decrease pain around the SIJ. The inclusion of this type of approach in SIJD can allow for improved patient management, better tolerance for other treatments and a more rapid application of pain-free exercise programs."

The aim was to develop an automated classification model based on multi-sensor player tracking device data to detect COD > 45°. Video analysis data and individual multi-sensor player tracking data (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscopic) for 23 academy-level soccer players were used. A novel 'GPS-COD Angle' variable was developed and used in model training; along with 24 GPS-derived, gyroscope and accelerometer variables. Video annotation was the ground truth indicator of occurrence of COD > 45°. The random forest classifier using the full set of features demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUROC = 0.957, 95% CI = 0.956-0.958, Sensitivity = 0.941, Specificity = 0.772. To balance sensitivity and specificity, model parameters were optimised resulting in a value of 0.889 for both metrics. Similarly high levels of accuracy were observed for random forest models trained using a reduced set of features, accelerometer-derived variables only, and gyroscope-derived variables only. These results point to the potential effectiveness of the novel methodology implemented in automatically identifying COD in soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W3178259269,AGAINST EPISTEMOLOGICAL HIERARCHIES: ON THE VALUE OF FORMING BODILY KNOWLEDGE,2021-07-06,2021,article,"The article reveals such concepts as “metis,” “body techniques,” “practical skill,” “kinesthetic intelligence,” and “movement skill.” These concepts are united by the fact that the accumulation of knowledge is presented as a largely unconscious process in which muscles play the same role as the brain. The essence of these concepts can be expressed in the term “bodily knowledge,” which contrasts itself in the epistemological sense with codified practical knowledge, instructions, and rules – techne. Bodily knowledge is based on movements and muscle sensations. Russian physiologist I.M. Sechenov called this sensation “dark,” pointing out that such sensations are almost impossible to comprehend, describe, and analyze. However, such feelings cannot be entirely opposed to thought. This “smart skill,” as poet and writer Varlam Shalamov called it, can be considered a separate type of cognition. This article is an attempt to comprehensively discuss the concept of “body knowledge.”"

This paper undertakes a comparative review of the current policies and practices of two high profile national sporting organisations of such sports-the Australian Football League (AFL) and Hockey Canada (HC)-in governing the issue as a regulatory concern. By examining the policies and practices of the AFL and HC, this study aims to identify common themes, divergent practices, and nuanced sport-specific approaches to develop understandings on the regulation and governance of this high profile sports injury. The paper aims to contribute to understanding concussion as a regulatory concern, while at the same time recognising the heterogeneity of sport and reinforcing nuanced understandings that align to specific social and cultural settings. We make recommendations based on regulatory and cultural legitimacy. The paper concludes that these NSOs are institutional actors with historical and cultural roots who assert regulatory legitimacy by steering and influencing behaviour and directing the regulatory agenda to manage and mitigate the harm associated with concussion."

Unobtrusive measurement and tracking of cognitive functioning is needed to enable preventative interventions for people at elevated risk of concussive injury. The focus of the present study is to investigate the potential for using passive measurements of fine motor movements (smooth pursuit eye tracking and read speech) and resting state brain activity (measured using fMRI) to complement existing diagnostic tools, such as the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), that are used for this purpose. Thirty-one high school American football and soccer athletes were tracked through the course of a sports season. Hypotheses were that (1) measures of complexity of fine motor coordination and of resting state brain activity are predictive of cognitive functioning measured by the ImPACT test, and (2) within-subject changes in these measures over the course of a sports season are predictive of changes in ImPACT scores. The first principal component of the six ImPACT composite scores was used as a latent factor that represents cognitive functioning. This latent factor was positively correlated with four of the ImPACT composites: verbal memory, visual memory, visual motor speed and reaction speed. Strong correlations, ranging between r = 0.26 and r = 0.49, were found between this latent factor and complexity features derived from each sensor modality. Based on a regression model, the complexity features were combined across sensor modalities and used to predict the latent factor on out-of-sample subjects. The predictions correlated with the true latent factor with r = 0.71. Within-subject changes over time were predicted with r = 0.34. These results indicate the potential to predict cognitive performance from passive monitoring of fine motor movements and brain activity, offering initial support for future application in detection of performance deficits associated with subconcussive events."

Extrinsic factors change dynamically, also due to fatigue. However, existing biomechanical findings concerning the impact of fatigue on the risk of ACL injuries remains inconsistent. We hypothesized that fatigue induced by acute workload in short and intense game periods, might in either of two ways: by pushing lower limbs mechanics toward a pattern close to injury mechanism, or alternatively by inducing opposed protective compensatory adjustments.In this study, we aimed at assessing the extent to which fatigue impact on joints kinematics and kinetics while performing repeated changes of direction (CoDs) in the light of the ACL risk factors.This was an observational, cross-sectional associative study. Twenty female players (age: 20-31 years, 1st-2nd Italian division) performed a continuous shuttle run test (5-m) involving repeated 180°-CoDs until exhaustion. During the whole test, 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces were used to compute lower limb joints angles and internal moments. Measures of exercise internal load were: peak post-exercise blood lactate concentration, heart rate (HR) and perceived exertion. Continuous linear correlations between kinematics/kinetics waveforms (during the ground contact phase of the pivoting limb) and the number of consecutive CoD were computed during the exercise using a Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) approach.The test lasted 153 ± 72 s, with a rate of 14 ± 2 CoDs/min. Participants reached 95% of maximum HR and a peak lactate concentration of 11.2 ± 2.8 mmol/L. Exercise duration was inversely related to lactate concentration (r = -0.517, p < 0.01), while neither%HR max nor [La-] b nor RPE were correlated with test duration before exhaustion (p > 0.05). Alterations in lower limb kinematics were found in 100%, and in lower limb kinetics in 85% of the players. The most common kinematic pattern was a concurrent progressive reduction in hip and knee flexion angle at initial contact (10 players); 5 of them also showed a significantly more adducted hip. Knee extension moment decreased in 8, knee valgus moment increased in 5 players. A subset of participants showed a drift of pivoting limb kinematics that matches the known ACL injury mechanism; other players displayed less definite or even opposed behaviors.Players exhibited different strategies to cope with repeated CoDs, ranging from protective to potentially dangerous behaviors. While the latter was not a univocal effect, it reinforces the importance of individual biomechanical assessment when coping with fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W3181014468,User-centric analytic approach to evaluate the performance of sports facilities: A study of swimming pools,2021-07-05,2021,article,"While the performance of sports facilities such as swimming pools is crucial to the health, safety and enjoyment of pool users, little research has been conducted to explore how to analytically evaluate the holistic performance of such facilities from the users' perspective. Even an evaluation framework portraying the key performance attributes of swimming pools is yet to be available. Recognising this research gap, this study aims to adopt a user-centric approach to evaluate the performance of swimming pools and a multi-stage study was initiated. After a thorough literature review, a performance attribute hierarchy for swimming pools was established through a focus group study and then two surveys, covering four swimming pools and 103 pool users interviewed, were conducted in Hong Kong. Analysing the responses using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method illustrates that the building services (i.e. utilitarian) aspect of swimming pools is more important than the architectural counterpart, and survey participants cared more about the performance attributes inside water than those outside. This study's novelty lies in that it adopted the user-centric approach, which can differentiate between the relative importance of different swimming pool components and prioritize resources for their maintenance and management. The evaluation framework as well as the findings of the study provides facilities managers with important benchmark criteria for optimising the performance of these sports facilities. In the long run, this study contributes to enabling the project stakeholders to conduct evidence-based decision making over the life cycle of sport facilities development and management."

The aim of this study is to access the curve characteristics, prevalence, and factors associated with IS in Chaozhou city. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in 2018, in which scoliosis screening was conducted among 5497 primary school students in Chaozhou city. Then, a case-control study based on the screening involving 2547 children was followed for the exploration of the associated factors. The questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, postural habits, cognition and self-sensation of scoliosis, and physical conditions were addressed for the investigation. ORs with 95% CIs were calculated based on logistic regression analysis to evaluate the factors associated with scoliosis. Results The prevalence of IS among primary school students was 6.15% in Chaozhou city, with 4.04% for males and 8.71% for females. The average Cobb angle was 15° (range 8 to 37°). Multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that female ( OR =2.45), BMI ( OR =0.67), having myopia ( OR =1.49), self-sensation of scoliosis with symptoms ( OR =5.52), insufficient sleep time ( OR =2.65, 3.33), and less exercise time ( OR =7.09, 7.29) were significantly associated with IS. Conclusions The prevalence of IS among primary school students in Chaozhou was at an average level, and it was significantly higher in females than in males. Lower body mass, having myopia, insufficient sleep time, and lower physical activity were associated with IS."

At present, contact-free, camera-based, multi-athlete detection and tracking have become a reality, mainly due to the advances in machine learning regarding computer vision and, specifically, advances in artificial convolutional neural networks (CNN), used for human pose estimation (HPE-CNN) in image sequences. Sport science in general, as well as coaches and athletes in particular, would greatly benefit from HPE-CNN-based tracking, but the sheer amount of HPE-CNNs available, as well as their complexity, pose a hurdle to the adoption of this new technology. It is unclear how many HPE-CNNs which are available at present are ready to use in out-of-the-box inference to squash, to what extent they allow motion analysis and if detections can easily be used to provide insight to coaches and athletes. Therefore, we conducted a systematic investigation of more than 250 HPE-CNNs. After applying our selection criteria of open-source, pre-trained, state-of-the-art and ready-to-use, five variants of three HPE-CNNs remained, and were evaluated in the context of motion analysis for the racket sport of squash. Specifically, we are interested in detecting player's feet in videos from a single camera and investigated the detection accuracy of all HPE-CNNs. To that end, we created a ground-truth dataset from publicly available squash videos by developing our own annotation tool and manually labeling frames and events. We present heatmaps, which depict the court floor using a color scale and highlight areas according to the relative time for which a player occupied that location during matchplay. These are used to provide insight into detections. Finally, we created a decision flow chart to help sport scientists, coaches and athletes to decide which HPE-CNN is best for player detection and tracking in a given application scenario."

One such innovation is the application of real-time monitoring, which comprises a smartwatch application and ecosystem, designed to collect, process and transmit a wide range of physiological, biomechanical, bioenergetic and environmental data using cloud-based services. We plan to assess the impact of this wireless technology during Tokyo 2020, where this technology could help characterize the physiological and thermal strain experienced by an athlete, as well as determine future management of athletes during a medical emergency as a result of a more timely and accurate diagnosis. Here we describe some of the innovative technologies developed for numerous sports at Tokyo 2020 ranging from race walking (20 km and 50 km events), marathon, triathlon, road cycling (including the time trial event), mountain biking, to potentially team sports played outdoors. A more symbiotic relationship between sport, health and technology needs to be encouraged that harnesses the unique demands of elite sport (e.g., the need for unobtrusive devices that provide real-time feedback) and serves as medical and preventive support for the athlete's care. The implementation of such applications would be particularly welcome in the field of medicine (i.e., telemedicine applications) and the workplace (with particular relevance to emergency services, the military and generally workers under extreme environmental conditions). Laboratory and field-based studies are required in simulated scenarios to validate such emerging technologies, with the field of sport serving as an excellent model to understand and impact disease."

https://openalex.org/W3185670194,Guest Editorial: Visual Function and Sports Performance,2021-07-01,2021,editorial,"Remarkable athletic feats often invoke questions from observers about how these achievements are possible. In baseball, softball, and cricket, how does a batter achieve the remarkable temporal and spatial accuracy in their swing necessary to successfully bat the ball, all while under severe timing constraints? How does a soccer player moving at full speed ""thread the needle"" with a perfectly placed pass between defenders? Sports are necessarily designed to test the limits of human abilities, and given the vital role of vision in sport, it is important to consider how visual abilities enable or constrain sports performance. The overarching topic in this feature issue is the role of vision in sports performance. This area is clearly of growing interest, with 73% (1985/2713) of the citations returned in PubMed for the search terms ""sports"" and ""vision"" occurring since 2010 (on May 1, 2021). As further evidence of the interest and enthusiasm for sports vision, the International Sports Vision Association was formed to advance the field of vision assessment and training for athletes, and the Journal of Sports and Performance Vision began publishing research articles on these topics in 2019. Because sports vision encompasses a wide array of subject matters, the sports vision literature is understandably disseminated throughout many diverse journals that may or may not be devoted solely to vision. These journals are centered around topics including vision science, cognition, kinesiology and biomechanics, sports science, neuroscience, learning, and both ocular and systemic clinical issues. The goal of this feature issue is to bring together studies that cover a variety of topical areas in sports vision. There are articles on vision assessments, vision correction and eye protection, cognitive-perceptual issues, vision training, concussion, and retinal physiology. Key questions for sports vision practitioners that are addressed in this feature issue include the following: what visual or vision-related attributes may underpin success in a particular sport, what cues are used by athletes to compete successfully in their sport, what visual assessments are best to measure an athlete's current level of development and to estimate his/her future potential, and which training methods and training environments (e.g., virtual or on-field) result in optimal transfer to athletic competitions. In keeping with the global reach of sports, the articles in this feature issue were contributed by authors from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this feature issue, Erickson's1 review of visual skills and assessment devices describes the difficult challenge facing practitioners who must determine which of the myriad of visual skills are most important for a particular sport and which assessments are most appropriate to evaluate these skills.2,3 The review by Hodges and colleagues4 in this issue provides a conceptual framework for perceptual-cognitive skills that may aid the sports vision practitioner in determining those abilities to test and train in a particular sport. Hodges and colleagues divide these skills into fundamental skills (static visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, peripheral vision), low-level visual skills (color perception, contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity and depth perception, motion perception), high-level and attentional skills (visual attention and eye movements), and cognitive skills (memory, situational knowledge, anticipation, decision making, multitasking, inhibition and interference control, cognitive flexibility). Psychophysical studies of perceptual thresholds, studies of the functional limitations of eye movements, and studies of attentional thresholds in the general population and in athletes in particular serve as a basis for hypotheses regarding when and how visual skills could apply to specific sports. Another area of emphasis addressed in this feature issue is the comparison of visual skills between athletes (and referees) across different levels of expertise and across different ages.5–12 This includes several original investigations comparing differing levels of expertise,5,6,11 as well as a review by Dalton7 that addresses the quiet eye phenomena. This influential concept refers to ""the final fixation or tracking gaze prior to the onset of a critical motor action,"" which has been shown to correlate with performance and overall expertise in athletes.7 A key thesis underlying these studies of vision in athletic experts is that at least some of the differences found between higher- and lower-achieving individuals may form the basis of training approaches that can promote athletic (or officiating) performance. There are some major questions in ball-striking sports such as baseball and cricket that are addressed in this feature issue.4,10,13 These questions include what information is used by athletes in determining when and where an approaching object will arrive to produce an appropriate visuomotor response, and how these cues are combined when generating motor responses. Gray's13 review in this issue discusses model-based control (primarily predictive and based on internal models of trajectory) versus online control (based on unfolding visual information) models. Much like the information gained in comparing expert and less expert or novice athletes, an understanding of how action is controlled may help to guide the development of sports vision training techniques. Another question that has generated much interest in the sports vision literature is that of coupled versus uncoupled responses.14–16 In an uncoupled response, the observer's response is not the same as that required in a game. For example, in cricket, a coupled response would involve a batter attempting to strike approaching balls, whereas an uncoupled response might require the batter to verbally assess when or where the pitched ball will arrive. There is a growing literature suggesting that performance as assessed with coupled responses does not necessarily match performance when measured with uncoupled responses. As described by Mann and colleagues16 in this issue, it has been suggested that differences in coupled and uncoupled responses could be explained by the two-visual-systems hypothesis, wherein uncoupled responses require an overreliance on the ventral system, whereas the dorsal system is primarily used in coupled responses. This discussion of coupled and uncoupled responses raises numerous questions for testing and training sports vision skills. For example, in talent identification, how representative of in-game tasks must the testing be? In addition, in testing and training athletes, how do practitioners reconcile the requirements of representative training paradigms with limitations on both space and time available for training? Finally, is virtual reality sports training representative enough of in-game conditions to lead to transfer of training to the field?9,17 Competitive video game play (electronic sports, or Esports) continues to grow rapidly in popularity, but little is known about the visual function of Esports players. In this feature issue, Fogt and colleagues18 looked at visual attributes in amateur video game players such as visual acuity, refractive error, accommodative lag, stereoacuity, and tear break-up time. They found that all these attributes except tear break-up time were similar to those reported in published population studies. Future studies comparing amateur video game players and professional Esports players would be a next logical step, allowing for a complete profile of visual skills essential for success in the Esports arena. Another area of interest in sports vision that is the subject of several articles in this feature issue is the influence of visual impairment on sports performance and the related topic of Paralympic classification. In their review, Chun and colleagues19 describe the evolving science of Paralympic sport classification. In this area, work is underway to define how vision influences performance and to appropriately categorize visually impaired athletes to ensure fair competition.19–21 This topic of vision and visual impairments in sports is also central to other articles in this issue that address concussion and eye movements,22 visors for football helmets,23 and the retinal physiology of athletes.24 Ultimately, the goals of sports vision are to determine the best ways to assess vision in athletes and to develop optimal techniques to train vision to improve athletic performance.9,25 Because sports provide robust metrics of performance and because the objective is to achieve better game performance, there has been a strong desire to link vision assessment and/or vision training to quantitative measures of sports performance. In this issue, Laby and Appelbaum9 provide a review of the 13 published articles that have addressed correlations between visual assessments and game statistics and 16 articles that addressed gains due to vision training using benchmarks from in-game statistical production. From this review, the authors conclude that, although some studies reported positive findings and others did not, the field will be best advanced by adopting best practices as used in clinical trial designs, including pre-registration of experimental protocols, power analysis to determine sample size, and the inclusion of a matched control group. Through these approaches, sports vision research will offer greater rigor and increased impact toward improving athletic performance. In closing, we want to acknowledge the indispensable contributions of the many individuals who reviewed the articles submitted for the feature issue. We believe that this issue provides what we hoped for: sufficient breadth and depth of materials for everyone involved in sports vision to find something of interest and discussions of the many opportunities available for new studies of sports vision that will hopefully lead to on-field improvements in performance. There is clearly much exciting work still to be done in sports vision. Because this area encompasses so many scientific disciplines, there are numerous possibilities for collaboration to advance the field. We hope you enjoy this feature issue as much as we enjoyed putting it together.

The nature of the injury being primarily due to non-contact mechanics further implicates neural control as a key injury-risk factor, though it has received considerably less study. Purpose: To determine the contribution of neural activity to injury-risk mechanics in ecological sport-specific VR landing scenarios. Methods: Ten female high-school soccer players (15.5±0.85 years; 165.0±6.09 cm; 59.1±11.84 kg) completed a neuroimaging session to capture neural activity during a bilateral leg press and a 3D biomechanics session performing a header within a VR soccer scenario. The bilateral leg press involved four 30 s blocks of repeated bilateral leg presses paced to a metronome beat of 1.2 Hz with 30 s rest between blocks. The VR soccer scenario simulated a corner-kick, requiring the participant to jump and head a virtual soccer ball into a virtual goal (Figure 1A-E). Initial contact and peak knee flexion and abduction angles were extracted during the landing from the header as injury-risk variables of interest and were correlated with neural activity. Results: Evidenced in Table 1 and Figure 1 (bottom row), increased initial contact abduction, increased peak abduction, and decreased peak flexion were associated with increased sensory, visual-spatial, and cerebellar activity (r 2 = 0.42-0.57, p corrected &lt; .05, z max &gt; 3.1, table &amp; figure 1). Decreased initial contact flexion was associated with increased frontal cortex activity (r 2 = 0.68, p corrected &lt; .05, z max &gt; 3.1). Conclusion: Reduced neural efficiency (increased activation) of key regions that integrate proprioceptive, visual-spatial, and neurocognitive activity for motor control may influence injury-risk mechanics in sport. The regions found to increase in activity in relation to higher injury-risk mechanics are typically activated to assist with spatial navigation, environmental interaction, and precise motor control. The requirement for athletes to increase their activity for more basic knee motor control may result in fewer neural resources available to maintain knee joint alignment, allocate environmental attention, and handle increased motor coordination demands. These data indicate that strategies to enhance efficiency of visual-spatial and cognitive-motor control during high demand sporting activities is warranted to improve ACL injury-risk reduction.

https://openalex.org/W3178386197,"NEURAL ACTIVITY AND LANDING BIOMECHANICS: EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE BRAIN, BODY, AND ACL INJURY-RISK",2021-07-01,2021,article,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries predominantly occur via non-contact mechanisms, secondary to motor coordination errors resulting in aberrant frontal plane knee loads that exceed the thresholds of ligament integrity. However, central nervous system processing underlying high injury-risk motor coordination errors remain unknown, limiting the optimization of current injury reduction strategies. Purpose: To evaluate the relationships between brain activity during motor tasks with injury-risk loading during a drop vertical jump. Methods: Thirty female high school soccer players (16.10 ± 0.87 years, 165.10 ± 4.64 cm, 63.43 ± 8.80 kg) were evaluated with 3D biomechanics during a standardized drop vertical jump from a 30 cm box and peak knee abduction moment was extracted as the injury-risk variable of interest. A neuroimaging session to capture neural activity (via blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal) was then completed which consisted of 4 blocks of 30 seconds of repeated bilateral leg press action paced to a metronome beat of 1.2 Hz with 30 seconds rest between blocks. Knee abduction moment was evaluated relative to neural activity to identify potential neural contributors to injury-risk. Results: There was a direct relationship between increased landing knee abduction moment and increased neural activation within regions corresponding to the lingual gyrus, intracalcarine cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus (r 2 = 0.68, p corrected &lt; .05, z max &gt; 3.1; Table 1 &amp; Figure 1). Conclusion: Elevated activity in regions that integrate sensory, spatial, and attentional information may contribute to elevated frontal plane knee loads during landing. Interestingly, a similar activation pattern related to high-risk landing mechanics has been found in those following injury, indicating that predisposing factors to injury may be accentuated by injury or that modern rehabilitation does not recover prospective neural control deficits. These data uncover a potentially novel brain marker that could guide the discovery of neural-therapeutic targets that reduce injury risk beyond current prevention methods.

https://openalex.org/W3193232547,Gastrocnemius medialis muscle-tendon properties and their relationship with power and reactive strength in elite youth soccer players,2021-07-01,2021,dissertation,"There are several key physical performance indicators (KPIs) in soccer, and these include lower limb power and reactive strength, which can be evaluated using a variety of jump assessments, e.g. countermovement jumps (CMJs) and drop jumps (DJs). These KPIs are thought to be underpinned by the physiological characteristics of the respective lower limb muscle-tendon units (MTUs). However, the influence of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) MTU on power and reactive strength in elite youth soccer players (ESP) is currently unknown. Before assessing MTU properties and KPIs in ESP, it is important to understand the reproducibility of the respective assessment methods. In chapter 3, the aim was to identify the between-session reliability of all methodological techniques involved in the subsequent chapters. For this, 12 physically active, healthy, young men were recruited, the findings demonstrated all morphological properties of the GM muscle and GM tendon could be measured with high levels of reproducibility (coefficient of variation (CV)=1.2-6.6%; mean bias ratio (MBR)=1.00-1.09, ratio limits of agreement (RLoA)=1.04-1.22). Mechanical and material properties of the GM tendon could also be measured reliably (CV=2.6-17.3%; MBR=1.00-1.13, RLoA=1.08-1.80), however, the reproducibility of these techniques was slightly lower than for the morphological properties. Furthermore, a simplified method for calculating GM tendon mechanical/material properties proved reliable and agreed with the more comprehensive method, when assessed in 13 ESP and 12 non-athletes. This provides researchers/practitioners with a valid, reliable, and efficient method to monitor GM MTU properties when time is limited, e.g. when working with elite athletes. During jump-based assessments, peak power was measured more reliably during bilateral than unilateral CMJ, while reactive strength temporal variables during a DJ were more reliable than kinetic parameters. The second experimental study (chapter 4) aimed to determine whether the physiological characteristics of the GM muscle, as well as lower-limb power and reactive strength (the ability to develop maximal forces in minimal time while changing from an eccentric to concentric contraction) during CMJ and DJ, differed between ESP and recreationally active control participants (CON). A second aim was to investigate the relationship between GM muscle properties with lower limb power and reactive strength. ESP (17.4 ± 2.5) displayed a larger GM fascicle pennation angle (θp) compared to CON (14.3 ± 1.2, P<0.001), while projectile range and horizontal peak power during bilateral and unilateral horizontal CMJ were greater in the ESP. Furthermore, GM θp and cross-sectional area correlated with power generated in the vertical and horizontal plane of motion during unilateral vertical and bilateral horizontal CMJ, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, GM muscle fascicle length and muscle volume both correlated inversely with power during bilateral vertical and horizontal jumps, although this may represent the differing biomechanical demands between unilateral and bilateral jumping tasks. The third experimental study (chapter 5) aimed to determine whether the mechanical and material properties of the GM tendon differed between ESP and CON, and whether GM tendon properties were related to lower limb power and reactive strength during CMJs and DJ. Tendon properties did not differ between ESP and CON but tendon elongation and strain correlated inversely with power during unilateral vertical CMJ, whilst higher force and vertical stiffness outputs were achieved during a DJ by stronger individuals with stiffer and larger GM tendons. Together with the findings from chapter 4, the results from chapter 5 suggest that specific physiological characteristics of the GM MTU could be deemed favourable for lower limb power and reactive strength capabilities. Through identifying (and perhaps developing) these characteristics in ESP, such KPIs in soccer players may be improved. The purpose of the fourth and final experimental study (chapter 6) was to investigate the effects of a 12-week in-season soccer training programme on GM MTU properties and jump performance in 14 ESP. Post-training, GM θp (pre-training: 18.0 ± 2.5 ; post-training: 17.2 ± 2.6 ; P=0.038), maximal tendon elongation (pre-training: 2.68 ± 0.58 cm; post-training: 2.30 ± 0.46 cm; P=0.019) and maximal tendon strain (pre-training: 12.8 ± 2.4 %; post-training: 11.1 ± 2.5 %; P=0.019) all reduced. Furthermore, projectile range during a unilateral horizontal CMJ increased from pre- to post-training (pre-training: 0.93 ± 0.15 m; post-training: 1.07 ± 0.12 m; P=0.001) but no other jump metrics changed. The physiological reasons for these changes are unclear but it is plausible that GM θp decreased to facilitate a faster shortening of the overall muscle in response to pitch-based training. Alternatively, it may have occurred in response to the limited progressive overload applied to the plantar flexors during in-season training (potentially leading to a detraining effect). Further, the reductions in tendon elongation and strain may have been due to a change in the material properties of the tendon (e.g. increased density of collagen fibrils) that did not quite translate to changes in stiffness or modulus. Crucially, however, these changes did not correlate (neither individually, nor in combination) with the change in projectile range during a unilateral horizontal CMJ, thus suggesting they did not contribute to this increase in jump performance. These results demonstrate that a 12-week period of in-season soccer training is not a sufficient chronic stimulus to elicit meaningful adaptation of the GM MTU to cause significant improvements in power and reactive strength during different jump-based assessments. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that the reproducibility of the techniques used to characterise GM MTU properties is generally acceptable to very good. Furthermore, specific GM MTU properties are related to lower limb power and reactive strength. Moreover, this thesis demonstrates that a three-month period of in-season soccer training is insufficient to elicit meaningful GM MTU adaptations required to improve physical performance. Therefore, whilst multiple factors contribute to influencing KPIs in ESP, this thesis presents novel information regarding the GM MTU and highlights potential physiological determinants that can be developed in youth soccer players."

Seventy boys aged 7-12 years of age (Mean ± SD = 9 ± 2 years) who were regularly engaged in grassroots soccer participated in the present study. The Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (Ulrich, 2001. Test of gross motor development (2nd ed.). Austin, TX: PRO-ED) was used to assess FMS and the Perceived Physical Ability Scale for Children (Colella, Morano, Bortoli, & Robazza, 2008. A physical self-efficacy scale for children. Social Behavior and Personality: an International Journal, 36, 841-848) was used to assess perceived competence. Technical skill was determined from three tests reflecting dribbling, passing and shooting. Z-scores of each measure were summed, creating a composite measure of technical skill. Three measures of physical fitness were employed; 15m sprint time, standing long jump, and seated medicine ball (1kg) throw. Z-scores for each measure were summed creating a composite measure of physical fitness. The relationship between technical skill and FMS, fitness, perceived competence and age was examined via path analysis. Results indicated two significant mediated pathways: from physical fitness to technical skills via FMS, and from physical fitness to technical skills via perceived competence. Once these mediators had been accounted for, there was no direct link from physical fitness to technical skills. Coaches should therefore seek to avoid one-sided delivery of practice by not solely focusing on football type drills, and focusing on a range of activities which enhance a broad foundation of FMS and promote strategies to positively influence a child's perception of their own competence.HighlightsFundamental movement skills (FMS) are considered the foundation for physical activity and sport performance yet they tend to be overlooked, in favour of physical fitness, in the development of soccer talent.We examined mediating effects of FMS and perceived competence in the relationship between physical fitness and technical soccer skills in 70, 7-12 year old grassroots soccer players.We suggests there is no direct effect of physical fitness on technical skills in soccer but both FMS and perceived competence act as mediators of the physical fitness-technical skill relationship in children aged 7-12 years old.Coaches should therefore look to develop a broad base of FMS and a higher perception of competence to improve children's technical soccer skills."

The purpose of this training is to enhance subsequent performance under normal visual conditions as a result of shifting attentional focus within the multisensory integration process. The training performed with the help of this technology that uses specially designed glasses increases the contribution of other somatosensory afferents to motor control by refocusing the individual’s attention on proprioceptive feedback. Other benefits of stroboscopic training include improved short-term visual memory, improved capacity for anticipation as well as increased ability to focus in general but particularly on the central visual field and thus produce coherent movements. The current paper is a metaanalysis of the literature on stroboscopic training and its benefits for professional sport. In sports using stroboscopic (strobe) glasses, for example in hockey, basketball, football, volleyball, baseball or tennis, positive effects on some skills have been identified and training and testing protocols have been described. The aim of this paper is to highlight some practical and methodological benchmarks resulting from the use of stroboscopic training in various sports, and then transfer them to climbing training in order to enhance performance in this sport."

Thirty-one real-world car-to-VRU impact accident cases with detailed head injury records were collected and replicated through the computational biomechanics method; head injuries observed in the analyzed accidents were reconstructed by using a finite element (FE)-multibody (MB) coupled pedestrian model [including the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS) head–neck FE model and the remaining body segments of TNO MB pedestrian model], which was developed and validated in our previous study. Various typical HICs were used to predict head injuries in all accident cases. Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis method was adopted to investigate the correlation between head kinematics-based injury criteria and the actual head injury of VRU; the effectiveness of brain deformation-based injury criteria in predicting typical brain injuries [such as diffuse axonal injury diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and contusion] was assessed by using head injury risk curves reported in the literature. Results showed that for head kinematics-based injury criteria, the most widely used HICs and head impact power (HIP) can accurately and effectively predict head injury, whereas for brain deformation-based injury criteria, the maximum principal strain (MPS) behaves better than cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM 0.15 and CSDM 0.25 ) in predicting the possibility of DAI.

Models were adjusted for age, body mass index, arm dominance, playing standard, years played baseball, and injury and surgery history.A total of 117 former baseball players participated (age: 36.8 [13.7] years). The mean dominant SANE score was 70.2 (standard deviation 24.1), and the mean nondominant SANE score was 85.2 (standard deviation 19.4). There was no difference in dominant arm SANE scores when stratified by arm injury history (4.6 [95% confidence interval: -14.9, 5.8]) or arm surgery history (-3.8 [95% confidence interval: 13.4, 5.8]). The shoulders had the greatest persistent joint pain prevalence (28% of all participants) and elbows (21% of all participants). There was no relationship between dominant arm pain or function and playing position.This is the first study to demonstrate an increase in dominant arm disability in former baseball players. The high prevalence of persistent arm pain and poor arm function among former baseball players is concerning considering participants were younger than 40 years of age. No differences were observed in arm function when stratifying by arm history, surgery, or position demonstrating the potential relationship between baseball participation and arm disability after cessation of play. Clinicians should consider working with baseball players to develop long-term strategies to maintain joint health, especially in the throwing arm, when baseball players are transitioning to retirement. Future research is needed to understand the long-term effectiveness of clinical treatments and the implications of specific arm injuries such as ulnar collateral ligament tears on persistent arm pain and function."

Material and Methods. The participants of this study were 84 male students engaged in amateur climbing aged 18-19 years. All athletes were also students of physical education faculties of Ukrainian universities; 40 athletes were in the experimental group and 44 athletes were in the control group. The biomechanical technology for injury prevention in the training of specialists in physical education and sports has been developed on rock climbing for example. Developed biomechanical technology for injury prevention contains 3 areas: 1 - theoretical; 2 - analytical; 3 - practical. Injury risk (incidence) was defined as the number of injuries to the total number of athletes in the analyzed group. Relative risk (incidence rate ratio) was determined by the ratio of risk in the control group to the risk in the experimental group. The chance of injury was defined as the ratio of the number of injuries to the number of uninjured athletes in the analyzed group. The relative chance (Odds Ratio) was defined as the chances of injury in the control group to the chances of injury in the experimental group. These indicators were determined separately for low, medium and severe finger injuries. Results. The applied technology of injury prevention significantly influences the reduction of the number of injuries of athletes – future specialists on the physical education and sports (on rock climbing for example). It is established that the application of the developed technology of injury prevention reduces the risk of finger injuries: low complexity – in 2.364 times (95% CI = 0.925-6.041, P&gt; 0,05) times; medium complexity – in 3.333 times (95% CI = 1.001-11.096, P (Fisher) = 0.030); high complexity – in 8.182 times (95% CI = 1.084-61.749, P (Fisher) = 0.011). Conclusions. The application of the developed biomechanical technology of injury prevention in the process of training specialists in physical education and sports significantly reduces the risk of injury to students."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different temperature cryotherapies on leg extension performance. Thirty-one male participants from a University volunteered to join two different temperature cryotherapies. The peak power and peak force of right leg extension performance of each participant was measured by Keiser, before and after cryotherapy, respectively. The results of this study show that there was a significant difference in peak power (t = −3.203, p value = 0.003) and peak force (t = −4.662, p value = 0) before and after 0 °C cryotherapy. In addition, there was a significant difference in peak force (t = −4.36, p value = 0) before and after −5 °C cryotherapy. Besides, the changing rates of peak power (3.03%) and peak force (11.51%) in the 0 °C group were higher than those of peak power (2.80%), as well as peak force (7.45%), in the −5 °C group. The PF in the 0 °C and −5 °C groups both significantly increased after cryotherapy. Peak power significantly increased after 0 °C cryotherapy, but did not significantly increase after −5 °C cryotherapy. The changing rates of peak power and peak force in the 0 °C group were both higher than the −5 °C group. A short period of cold treatment at 0 °C may increase the leg extension ability. A 0 °C cold therapy for a short period of time is more suitable than a −5 °C one for athletes to recover during the interval within a competition. Athlete and coach could choose an appropriate temperature to help increase performance of physical level and recovery."

These two aspects have never been assessed together in real scenarios in the young population. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of motor coordination on lower limb biomechanics in young footballers during an on-the-pitch training. Eighteen juvenile football players (10 y ± 2 m) were enrolled. Each player performed a training drill with sport-specific movements (vertical jump, agility ladders, change of direction) and the Harre circuit test (HCT) to evaluate players' motor coordination. Wearable inertial sensors (MTw Awinda, Xsens) were used to assess lower limb joint angles and accelerations. Based on the results of the HCT, players were divided into poorly coordinated (PC) and well-coordinated (WC) on the basis of the literature benchmark. The PC group showed a stiffer hip biomechanics strategy (up to 40% lower flexion angle, ES = 2.0) and higher internal-external hip rotation and knee valgus (p < 0.05). Significant biomechanical limb asymmetries were found only in the PC group for the knee joint (31-39% difference between dominant and non-dominant limb, ES 1.6-2.3). Poor motor coordination elicited altered hip and knee biomechanics during sport-specific dynamic movements. The monitoring of motor coordination and on-field biomechanics might enhance the targeted trainings for ACL injury prevention."

They compromise quality of life, affect knee structure and function, lead to the early development of osteoarthritis and are a serious economic burden due to shortened professional careers and subsequent surgeries. Up to 35% of children and adolescents will experience a second ACL injury and this population particularly at high risk of secondary intraarticular soft tissue degeneration and growth abnormalities. However, there is still a lack of high-quality outcome studies on this specific population and many knowledge gaps persist in the current treatment guidelines. It is currently unknown whether ACL reconstruction in this young population decreases the risk of irreversible secondary intraarticular soft tissue degeneration. Furthermore, it is not known whether return to high or elite level sports after paediatric ACL injury or reconstruction should be recommended. The relatively low number of paediatric ACL injuries seen in each hospital makes it necessary to conduct international multi-centre studies to collect robust data to provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of these injuries. The Paediatric Anterior Cruciate Ligament Initiative (PAMI) was thus started by the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery &amp; Arthroscopy and opened for patient inclusion in 2018. This comprehensive overview of the first 2 years of the PAMI registry shows that the project is now well consolidated and accepted by the European orthopaedic community. Future challenges include ensuring additional external funding to ascertain long term sustainability and continuous dissemination of the knowledge acquired in scientific journals."

A Narrative Review,2021-06-24,2021,review,"Recent research in Paralympic biomechanics has offered opportunities for coaches, athletes, and sports practitioners to optimize training and performance, and recent systematic reviews have served to summarize the state of the evidence connecting biomechanics to Paralympic performance. This narrative review serves to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the evidence related to biomechanics and Paralympic performance published since 2016. The main themes within this review focus on sport-specific body posture: the standing, sitting, and horizontal positions of current summer Paralympic sports. For standing sports, sprint and jump mechanics were assessed in athletes with cerebral palsy and in lower-limb amputee athletes using running-specific prostheses. Our findings suggest that running and jumping-specific prostheses should be ‘tuned’ to each athlete depending on specific event demands to optimize performance. Standing sports were also inclusive to athletes with visual impairments. Sitting sports comprise of athletes performing on a bike, in a wheelchair (WC), or in a boat. WC configuration is deemed an important consideration for injury prevention, mobility, and performance. Other sitting sports like hand-cycling, rowing, and canoeing/kayaking should focus on specific sitting positions (e.g., arm-crank position, grip, or seat configuration) and ways to reduce aero/hydrodynamic drag. Para-swimming practitioners should consider athlete-specific impairments, including asymmetrical anthropometrics, on the swim-start and free-swim velocities, with special considerations for drag factors. Taken together, we provide practitioners working in Paralympic sport with specific considerations on disability and event-specific training modalities and equipment configurations to optimize performance from a biomechanical perspective."

Options include: drugs, surgical intervention, scaffolds, biologics as a product of cells, and physical and electro-magnetic stimuli. The goal of regenerative medicine is to enhance the healing of tissue after musculoskeletal injuries as both isolated treatment and adjunct to surgical management, using novel therapies to improve recovery and outcomes. Various orthopaedic biologics (orthobiologics) have been investigated for the treatment of pathology involving the knee, including symptomatic osteoarthritis and chondral injuries, as well as injuries to tendon, meniscus, and ligament, including the anterior cruciate ligament. Promising and established treatment modalities include hyaluronic acid (HA) in liquid or scaffold form; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); bone marrow aspirate (BMA) comprising mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and growth factors; connective tissue progenitor cells (CTPs) including adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) and tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs); matrix cell–based therapy including autologous chondrocytes or allograft; vitamin D; and fibrin clot. Future investigations should standardize solution preparations, because inconsistent results reported may be due to heterogeneity of HA, PRP, BMAC, or MSC preparations and regimens, which may inhibit meaningful comparison between studies to determine the true efficacy and safety for each treatment."

Torque measurements were obtained under three concentric conditions (angular velocities of 60 °/s, 180 °/s, and 300 °/s) and one static condition by utilizing the Biodex System 3.In all trials, the volleyball players achieved significantly higher peak torque (PT) values for both the extensors and flexors (p < 0.05) than those of the control group. However, the strength ratio of the flexors and extensors (H/Q) in the experimental group was only 83% of the standard reported in the literature. The most developed and dominating muscles in the knee joints of the volleyball players were the extensors, which accounted for the low strength ratio and dynamic instability of this joint.Based on a proper assessment of the strength ratio of the knee flexors and extensors, properly selected and implemented resistance training can improve the maximum strength and power production and reduce the incidence of injuries in volleyball."

We aimed to develop a list of assessment items to address this gap. Methods We used a three-round Delphi survey approach to develop consensus of opinion among 155 globally diverse health professionals working in elite field or court sports. This involved surveys that were structured in question format with both closed-response and open-response options. We asked panellists to indicate their agreement about whether or not assessment items should support the RTS decision after an acute lateral ankle sprain injury. The second and third round surveys included quantitative and qualitative feedback from the previous round. We defined a priori consensus being reached at >70% agree or disagree responses. Results Sixteen assessment items reached consensus to be included in the RTS decision after an acute lateral ankle sprain injury. They were mapped to five domains with 98% panellist agreement - PAASS: Pain (during sport participation and over the last 24 hours), Ankle impairments (range of motion; muscle strength, endurance and power), Athlete perception (perceived ankle confidence/reassurance and stability; psychological readiness), Sensorimotor control (proprioception; dynamic postural control/balance), Sport/functional performance (hopping, jumping and agility; sport-specific drills; ability to complete a full training session).

Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is defined as specific instrumental intervention to normalize function in the musculoskeletal system. It is considered a treatment method for the mechanical alterations of the locomotor system, and it is widely used in sports for therapeutic and preventive purposes. Despite the clinical benefits observed in different musculoskeletal conditions, the action mechanism of diacutaneous fibrolysis remains uncertain. There are no studies evaluating the neuromuscular response on the posterior muscular chain of the lower extremity in athletes, where overload, stiffness, and injury incidence are high. Objective. To evaluate the immediate, and 30 min post treatment effects of a single diacutaneous fibrolysis session on passive neuromuscular response and mechanosensitibity on hamstring and gluteus in athletes with shortening. Design. A randomized within participant clinical trial. Methods. Sixty-six athletes with hamstring shortening were included (PKE &lt; 160). The lower limbs were randomized between the experimental limb and control limb, regardless of dominance. A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis was applied to the posterior gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus of the experimental lower limb whereas the control limb was not treated. Viscoelastic muscle properties (myotonometry), contractile muscle properties (tensomiography), and mechanosensitivity (algometry) were tested before treatment (T0), after treatment (T1), and 30 min post treatment (T2). Results. Regarding viscoelastic properties, in the intra-group analysis we found statistically significant differences in the experimental limb at T1, decreasing muscle stiffness in gluteus maximus (p &lt; 0.042), in biceps femoris (p &lt; 0.001) and in semitendinosus (p &lt; 0.032). We also observed statistically significant differences in Tone decrease (p &lt; 0.011) and relaxation increase (p &lt; 0.001) in biceps femoris. At T2, the decrease in stiffness in all tested muscles was maintained (p &lt; 0.05). There were statistically significant inter-groups differences in stiffness on gluteus (p &lt; 0.048) and biceps femoris (p &lt; 0.019) and in tone on biceps femoris (p &lt; 0.009) compared to the control limb. For contractile properties, we only found statistically significant differences on maximal radial displacement (Dm) in gluteus, both control and experimental at T2 (p &lt; 0.05) and in biceps femoris control (p &lt; 0.030). No changes were found in the mechanosensitivity. Conclusions. A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis produces changes in some parameters related to viscoelasticity properties of the biceps femoris and gluteus.

Internal training load was collected from 15 elite soccer players over one full season (40 weeks). Acute, chronic, Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR), Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) ACWR, 2, 3 and 4-week cumulative load, training strain and training monotony were calculated on a rolling weekly basis. Players completed a daily illness log, documenting any signs and symptoms, to help determine an URTI. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between training load indices and URTIs across different lag periods (1 to 7-days). The results found a significant association between 2-week cumulative load and an increased likelihood of a player contracting an URTI 3 days later (Odds Ratio, 95% Confidence Interval: OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.026-1.431). Additionally, a significant association was found between 3-week cumulative load and a players’ increased risk of contracting an URTI 4 days later (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.013–1.006). These results indicate that accumulated periods of high training load (2- and 3-week) associated with an increased risk of a player contracting an URTI, which may lead to performance decrements, missed training sessions or even competitions."

A Scoping Review of the Literature,2021-06-15,2021,review,"A single, severe traumatic brain injury can result in chronic sleep disturbances that can persist several years after the incident. In contrast, it is unclear whether there are sleep disturbances after a sports-related concussion (SRC). Considering growing evidence of links between sleep disturbance and neurodegeneration, this review examined the potential links between diagnosed SRCs and sleep disturbances to provide guidance for future studies.The scoping review undertook a systematic search of key online databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, SportDiscus, and Web of Science) using predetermined search terms for any articles that examined sleep after concussion. A screening criterion using agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria was utilized to ensure inclusion of relevant articles.This scoping review is guided by the PRSIMA Scoping Review report.Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 896 adults who had experienced an SRC. Comparison with 1327 non-SRC adults occurred in 8 studies. Nine studies subjectively examined sleep, of which all but one study reported sleep disturbances after an SRC. Three studies objectively measured sleep, with 2 studies indicating large coefficients of variation of sleep duration, suggesting a range of sleep responses after an SRC. The only study to examine overnight polysomnography showed no differences in sleep metrics between those with and without an SRC. No studies examined interventions to improve sleep outcomes in people with concussion.This scoping review indicates preliminary evidence of sleep disturbances following an SRC. The heterogeneity of methodology used in the included studies makes consensus on the results difficult. Given the mediating role of sleep in neurodegenerative disorders, further research is needed to identify physiological correlates and pathological mechanisms of sleep disturbances in SRC-related neurodegeneration and whether interventions for sleep problems improve recovery from concussion and reduce the risk of SRC-related neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3170638855,Comparison between traditional resistance exercise and variable resistance with elastic bands in acute vertical jump performance,2021-06-14,2021,article,"Purpose Resistance exercise (RE) with variable resistance (VR) may be an interesting strategy to increase strength and power in several sports activities. The present study aimed to compare the effect of RE vs. VR exercise in the back squat on subsequent jump performance at different time points. Methods Nine male elite handball athletes (age: 21.4 ± 2.1 years; body fat percentage: 10.5 ± 4.2%) undergoing in-season training participated in the study. They randomly completed 3 sets of 5 back squat repetitions at 85% of predicted one-repetition maximum (1RM) with 3-minute rests between sets. They performed RE back squat alone or VR back squat by combining 55% of 1RM using standard weight plates and 29.7 ± 2.0% of the athlete’s 1RM in fully erect position (starting position) with elastic band resistance. Countermovement jump (CMJ) test was applied at baseline, immediately after the conditioning activity (within 15 seconds), and every 2 minutes after the protocols (2, 4, 6, and 8 minutes). Results There was a very large (5.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02, &lt;i&gt;ES&lt;/i&gt; = 1.53) increase in CMJ performance 2 minutes after VR back squat, while no significant changes were observed after the completion of RE back squat. Moreover, there was a large (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04, &lt;i&gt;ES&lt;/i&gt; = 1.27) increase in peak power after VR exercise. Conclusions CMJ performance and peak power output can be potentiated after 2 minutes of recovery following the completion of back squat exercise combining RE plus elastic bands, reinforcing the practical applicability of VR exercise."

https://openalex.org/W3166128640,Learning to teach and play futsal using digital tablets: What knowledge do sports science students mobilize?,2021-06-12,2021,article,"Abstract There is little research on the knowledge mobilized by sports science students when they learn to play a sport by learning to teach it. This study focuses on the benefits of using digital tablets to foster this learning during a university teaching module in futsal with students in the second year of a sports science bachelor’s degree. We compare the knowledge mobilized by these students during self-confrontation interviews (based on video recordings of the sessions), game situations, reciprocal coaching and debates of ideas. We then identify the nature of this knowledge and the strategies for its mobilization in context using a framework mainly based on didactics in physical education (Amade-Escot, 2006; Armour, 2011) and on pedagogical content knowledge studies (Shulman, 1986). The students were divided into two experimental conditions following the same pedagogical curriculum. The students in condition 1 used digital tablets to film themselves, tag videos and discuss the recordings. The students in condition 2 did not use tablets. The interviews were conducted twice during the teaching module: first during period 1 (beginning of the module) and then during period 2 (end of the module). The results show that students in condition 1 were more likely to mobilize shared knowledge, make decisions through cooperation and even devolve the construction of tactical reasoning and knowledge by their peers following the didactic approach of the faculty teacher as early as period 1. This promoted access to the construction and meaning of teaching and learning content. These results are discussed in light of the current challenges within educational systems and of the joint development of interactional skills for learning to cooperate and even to teach."

Cox proportional hazards and shared frailty models were fitted to overuse and traumatic injuries; individualized robust Z-scores for 7- and 28-d accumulated exposure, and week-to-week change in exposure, age, sex, company rank, and injury history were included as time-varying covariates.Across 381,710 h of exposure, 1332 medical attention and 427 time-loss injuries were observed. Positive relationships were observed between week-to-week change in exposure and overuse time-loss (+1 Z-score hazard ratio (HR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.53) and medical attention injury risk (+1 Z-score HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.28). A negative relationship was observed between 7-d accumulated exposure and overuse medical attention injury risk (+1 Z-score HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.66-0.84). Overuse time-loss injury risk was greater in soloists compared with the corps de ballet (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01-2.15) and in dancers with a higher previous injury rate (+1 injury per 1000 h HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10). Only age was associated with traumatic time-loss (+1-yr HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09) or medical attention injury risk (+1-yr HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07).Professional ballet companies should implement training principles such as periodization and progression, particularly in the case of senior-ranking dancers, older dancers, and dancers with high rates of previous injury. These findings provide a basis for future prospective investigations into specific causal injury pathways."

It has reported high sensitivity, specificity and test-retest reliability to discriminate between people with knee pain, with or without patellofemoral pain. SNAPPS hasn't been studied in Thailand; therefore, the aim of this study was to cross-culturally adapt the questionnaire into Thai. This study was separated into two phases: cross-cultural adaptation and test-retest reliability. The Survey Instrument for Natural History, Aetiology and Prevalence of Patellofemoral Pain was translated into Thai following the guidelines for the cross cultural adaptation of self-report measures including six steps. Thirty four knee pain patients performed the test-retest reliability of the final version of this questionnaire. They were clinically diagnosed with patellofemoral pain by a physical therapist. They were asked to complete the questionnaire twice; with the 1st session and 2nd session having a 30 min break between. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC3, 1) method was used to determine test-retest reliability. The correlation of SNAPPS and VAS-U, VAS-W, VAS-S, VAS- J, VAS- R, and VAS- SQ were analyzed by Pearson correlation. The thirty-four participants (19 males, 15 females; with ages ranging 19-24 years) with patellofemoral pain were assessed twice with a 30 min break between the two sessions. The total scores of section 2 and 4 of the questionnaire indicated very strong test-retest reliability, ranging from 0.83 to 0.954 and the total score was ICC 0.91. Moreover, the Survey Instrument for Natural History, Aetiology and Prevalence of Patellofemoral Pain had a correlation with intensity of pain during ascending and descending stairs. The Thai version of the Survey Instrument for Natural History, Aetiology and Prevalence of Patellofemoral Pain can be used to assess patellofemoral pain in young Thai patients."

The aim was to establish the relative importance of external training load measurements to relate to the musculoskeletal response on a group and individual player level. Sixteen elite male rugby league players were monitored across three seasons. Two- to seven-day exponential weighted averages (EWMA) were calculated for total distance, and individualised speed thresholds (via 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test) derived from global positioning systems. The sit and reach, dorsiflexion lunge, and adductor squeeze tests represented the musculoskeletal response. Partial least squares and repeated measures correlation analyses established the relative importance of training load measures and then investigated their relationship to the collective musculoskeletal response for individual players through the construction of latent variables. On a group level, 2- and 3-day EWMA total distance had the highest relative importance to the collective musculoskeletal response (p < 0.0001). However, the magnitude of relationships on a group (r value = 0.20) and individual (r value = 0.06) level were trivial to small. The lack of variability in the musculoskeletal response over time suggest practitioners adopting such measures to understand acute musculoskeletal fatigue responses should do so with caution."

It is commonly used by athletes in many sports. Its potential is shown in the development of strength, power, and overall sports performance. The aim of the study was to verify inconsistent views on deep squats, technical design, and related health risks. METHODS For the purposes of the review, the terms ""squat, knee, biomechanics, deep, patellofemoral, back squat, performance, arthritis, health, injury, risk"" were used. RESULTS It turns out that the technique of performing a deep squat has its strict principles, which must be respected and which have a significant impact on the benefits and risks. From loading, the lower position represents an increase in compressive and shear forces on the patellofemoral joint, however, this is a natural state that is not risky. Health hazards cannot be based on analytical-mathematical models, which are insufficient in this aspect. Extreme long-term exposure carries the risk of permanent consequences in the form of osteoarthritis. For prophylaxis or convalescence, it is possible to use effective aids like sleeves, kinesio taping, bandage or ""knee savers"". CONCLUSIONS With optimal technique and sensible exercise selection, there is no greater risk in healthy individuals without degenerative anatomical changes. In order to assess the effects of the squat forces on the ankle, knee, hip, spine, it is necessary to consider the technique and also individual anatomical differences."

Methods From 2013 to 2018, 35 eligible patients were treated with our navigated image-free ACJ- and CC-augmentation technique. The average follow-up was 3 years. Follow-up evaluations included the Constant-Murley Score, subjective shoulder value, Taft score, and the acromioclavicular joint instability (ACJI) score. The patients’ quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. In addition, in accordance with the instability criteria, radiographs were evaluated before surgery, after surgery, and during follow-up. Results Overall, 25 patients (71%) suffered an acute type V disruption, 5 (14%) had a type IV disruption, and 5 (14%) had an acute Rockwood type IIIb injury. The mean Constant-Murley Score was 90 (range: 56–100; p = 0.53) on the injured side, and the mean subjective shoulder value was 92% (range: 80–100%). The mean Taft and ACJI scores were 10 (range: 4–12) and 86 (range: 34–100), respectively and the mean EQ-5D was 86 (range: 2–100). The mean CC difference of the injured side was 4 mm (range: 1.9–9.1 mm) at follow-up, which was not significantly different than that of the healthy side ( p = 0.06). No fractures in the area of the clavicle or the coracoid were reported. Conclusions The arthroscopic- and navigation-assisted treatment of high-grade ACJ injuries in an anatomical double-tunnel configuration yields similar clinical and radiological outcomes as the conventional technique using an aiming device. Precise positioning of the navigation system prevents multiple drillings, which avoids fractures."

https://openalex.org/W3172631157,The instrumented sheep knee to elucidate insights into osteoarthritis development and progression: A sensitive and reproducible platform for integrated research efforts,2021-06-08,2021,review,"Osteoarthritis of the knee is a very common condition that has been difficult to treat. The majority of cases are considered idiopathic. Much research effort remains focused on biology rather than the biomechanics of such joints. Some new methods were developed and validated to better appreciate the subtleties of the biomechanical integrity of joints, and how changes in biomechanics can contribute to osteoarthritis.Over the past 15 years our lab has enhanced the sensitivity of the assessment of knee biomechanics of an instrumented, trained large animal model (sheep) of osteoarthritis and integrated the findings with biological and histological assessments. These new methods include gait analysis before and after injury followed by robotic validation post-sacrifice, and more recently using Fibre Bragg Grating sensors to detect alterations in cartilage stresses.A review of the findings obtained with this model are presented. The findings indicate that sheep, like humans, exhibit individual characteristics. They also indicate that joint kinetics, rather than kinematics may better define the alterations induced by injury. With the addition of Fibre Bragg Grating sensors, it has been possible to measure with good accuracy, alterations to cartilage stresses following a controlled knee injury.Using this model as Proof of Concept, this sheep system can now be viewed as a sensitive platform to address many questions related to risk for development of idiopathic osteoarthritis of the human knee, the efficacy of potential interventions to correct biomechanical disruptions, and how joint biomechanics and biology are integrated during aging."

Tensile strength, as one aspect of tendon biomechanical properties, is the main parameter of tendon function. Tendon injury will induce an immune response and cause the loss of tensile strength. Regulation of mechanical forces during tendon healing also changes immune response to improve regeneration. Here, the effects of internal/external forces and immune response on tendon regeneration are reviewed. The interaction between immune response and internal/external forces during tendon regeneration is critically examined and compared, in relation to other tissues. In conclusion, it is essential to maintain a fine balance between internal/external forces and immune response, to optimize tendon functional regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3164596882,Local dynamic stability of the lower-limb as a means of post-hoc injury classification,2021-06-04,2021,article,"Since most sporting injuries occur at the lower extremity (50% to 66%) and many of those injuries occur at the knee (30% to 45%), it is important to have robust metrics to measure risk of knee injury. Dynamic measures of knee stability are not commonly used in existing metrics but could provide important context to knee health and improve injury screening effectiveness. This study used the Local Dynamic Stability (LDS) of knee kinematics during a repetitive vertical jump to perform a post-hoc previous injury classification of participants. This study analyzed the kinematics from twenty-seven female collegiate division 1 (D1) soccer, D1 basketball, and club soccer athletes from Auburn University (height = 171 ± 8.9cm, weight = 66.3 ± 8.6kg, age = 19.8 ± 1.9yr), with 7 subjects having sustained previous knee injury requiring surgery and 20 subjects with no history of injury. This study showed that LDS correctly identified 84% of previously injured and uninjured subjects using a multivariate logistic regression during a fatigue jump task. Findings showed no statistical difference in kinematic position at maximum knee flexion during all jumps between previously injured and uninjured subjects. Additionally, kinematic positioning at maximum knee flexion was not indicative of LDS values, which would indicate that future studies should look specifically at LDS with respect to injury prevention as it cannot be effectively inferred from kinematics. These points suggest that the LDS preserves information about subtle changes in movement patterns that traditional screening methods do not, and this information could allow for more effective injury screening tests in the future."

Various methods of maturity estimation exist with limited knowledge of concordance between methods. This study aims to establish agreement between methods of varied constructs to predict maturity status and compare concordance of methods to categorise players using established thresholds. Methods This study compared four maturity equations using anthropometrical data from 113 male adolescent soccer players (mean ±SD; age, 14.3 ± 1 years) from two academies. Conservative (±1 year) and less conservative (±0.5 years) circa-PHV thresholds were employed. Results Analysis indicates tight (±0.3 year) agreement between maturity offset methods (MO), but broader agreement between MO and predicted adult height methods (–1.5 to 1 year). However, Kappa Cohen k suggests moderate to substantial (44%–67%) and fair to moderate (31%–60%) concordance between methods when using the conservative and less conservative circa-PHV thresholds respectively. Conclusion Despite MO equation iterations claiming to reduce systematic error, they provide very similar estimations. Additionally, practitioners should not use maturity offset and predicted adult height methods interchangeably and are encouraged to apply either method consistently when looking to estimate maturity status or biologically calssify players."

However, the effect of moonlight on animal activity is rarely evaluated in human‐modified landscapes and can be of vital importance to understand possible changes in ecosystem services provided by light‐sensitive taxa, such as insectivorous bats. Fragmentation changes forest structure and affects light penetration across the landscape. In this case, the effects of fragmentation on bat activity can be modulated by cyclical variations of moonlight intensity. We acoustically quantified the activity of nine aerial insectivorous bat species in relation to moonlight at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazonia. We aimed to understand species‐level variation in activity across habitats (continuous forest, fragments and secondary forest) at different temporal scales: lunar cycle, dark vs. bright nights and within nights. Amazonian aerial insectivorous bats responded more to habitat type than to moonlight, with two and six species showing reduced activity in fragments and secondary forest, respectively, compared to continuous forest. The lower activity in secondary forest suggests that despite c . 30 years of secondary forest regeneration, it is still less attractive as foraging habitat. An interactive effect of habitat type and moonlight on bat activity was most evident when contrasting dark and bright nights. Our results indicate that fragments have reduced bat activity on extremely bright nights, probably due to higher predation risk in small fragments. Species that emit constant‐frequency calls ( Pteronotus spp.) were the ones that most modulated their responses to habitat disturbance and moonlight. Otherwise, moonlight had little effect on hourly activity levels, irrespective of habitat type. Moonlight is capable of modulating the responses of some bat species in disturbed habitats, particularly in fragments."

The purpose of this study was to examine balance, neurocognitive function, and head impact biomechanics after an acute bout of heading before and after the Get aHEAD Safely in Soccer™ program intervention. Twelve youth female soccer players wore a Triax SIM-G head impact sensor during two bouts of heading, using a lightweight soccer ball, one before and one after completion of the Get aHEAD Safely in Soccer™ program intervention. Participants completed balance (BESS and SWAY) and neurocognitive function (ImPACT) tests at baseline and after each bout of heading. There were no significant changes in head impact biomechanics, BESS, or ImPACT scores pre- to post-season. Deficits in three of the five SWAY positions were observed from baseline to post-season. Although we expected to see beneficial changes in head impact biomechanics following the intervention, the coaches and researchers observed an improvement in heading technique/form. Lightweight soccer balls would be a beneficial addition to header drills during training as they are safe and help build confidence in youth soccer players."

This study examined whether mental fatigue confers negative carryover effects on the performance of a set of biceps curls, while also investigating physiological and psychological mechanisms proposed to explain the predicted effect. A randomized, cross-over design was employed. On Visit 1, participants (N = 10) performed a barbell biceps curl one-repetition maximum (1RM) test. On Visits 2/3, participants performed 20 biceps curls at 50% of their 1RM, followed by their respective 10-minute experimental manipulation (high vs. low cognitive exertion), and then a second set of biceps curls to exhaustion. Ratings of perceived exertion and electromyography of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, upper trapezius, thoracic erector spinae, and lumbar erector spinae were recorded during the physical task. The total number of repetitions completed was similar across the conditions. Results also failed to show between-condition differences for muscle activation and perceptions of exertion. Future research is needed to build an adequate knowledge base to determine whether there is an effect of mental fatigue on dynamic resistance-based task performance, and if so, identify the mechanisms explaining how and why."

The goals of this study were to compare the accelerations, decelerations and metabolic power between official and friendly full matches, between the first and second halves of the matches, and between both halves of official and friendly matches. Twelve professional soccer players (age, 28.6 ± 2.7 years; height, 182.1 ± 8.6 cm; body mass, 75.3 ± 8.2 kg; BMI, 22.6 ± 0.7 kg/m2) participated in this study. A total of 33 official and 10 friendly matches were analyzed from the Iranian Premier League. All matches were monitored using GPSPORTS systems Pty Ltd. The following variables were selected: total duration of the matches, metabolic power, accelerations Zone1 (<2 m·s-2) (AccZ1), accelerations Zone2 (2 to 4 m·s-2) (AccZ2), accelerations Zone3 (>4 m·s-2) (AccZ3), decelerations Zone1 (<-2 m·s-2) (DecZ1), decelerations Zone2 (-2 to -4 m·s-2) (DecZ2) and decelerations Zone3 (>-4 m·s-2) (DecZ3). The major finding was shown in metabolic power, where higher values occurred in friendly matches (p < 0.05 with small effect size). Furthermore, total duration, AccZ3, DecZ1, DecZ2, and DecZ3 were revealed to be higher in official matches, while AccZ1 and AccZ2 were higher in friendly matches. The second half of the official matches revealed higher values for total duration compared to friendly matches (p < 0.05, moderate effect size). In conclusion, this study observed higher values of metabolic power in friendly matches compared to official matches. AccZ3, DecZ1, DecZ2, and DecZ3 were higher in official matches, while AccZ1 and AccZ2 were higher in friendly matches."

Levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines change significantly in response to trauma and collectively define the inflammatory environment. Of these factors the resolvins, with their inherent anti-inflammatory, reparative, and analgesic properties, have become prominent. This study examined the levels of resolvins and other cytokines after ACL tears in skeletally immature and adult patients in order to determine if skeletal maturity affects the inflammatory pattern. Skeletally immature and adult patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and meniscal tears were prospectively enrolled over a 5-month period. Synovial fluid samples were obtained before surgery quantifying Resolvin E1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 by ELISA. Comparisons between skeletally immature patients and adults, the influence of meniscal tear, growth plate maturity and time from trauma were analyzed. Skeletally immature patients had significantly greater levels of Resolvin E1 and IL-10 compared with adults with an isolated anterior cruciate ligament lesion. Among the injured skeletally immature patients Resolvin E1 levels were greater in the open growth plate group compared with those with closing growth plates. Moreover, levels of Resolvin E1 and IL-10 appeared to decrease with time. Our results suggest that skeletally immature patients have a stronger activation of the Resolvin pattern compared to adult patients and that synovial fluid Resolvins could play an antinflammatory role in the knee after anterior cruciate ligament lesion and that its activity may be synergistic with that of IL-10."

However, no studies show the effects of a period without mandatory physical training on maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and anthropometric parameters in naval cadets. This study aimed to investigate changes in VO2 max and anthropometric parameters after 12 weeks without mandatory physical training in naval cadets. The sample was 38 healthy and physically active naval cadets. The measured variables, including VO2 max and anthropometric parameters, were evaluated through the 12-minute race test (12MRT) and the somatotype. Both variables had a separation of 12 weeks without mandatory physical training. A t-test for related samples was used to evidence changes between the test and post-test; effect size was calculated through Cohen's d-test. Distance in 12MRT and VO2 max showed significant decreases at the end of 12 weeks without mandatory physical training (p < 0.001). Likewise, the tricipital skinfold thickness and the endomorphic component showed significant increases (p < 0.05). 12 weeks without mandatory physical training significantly reduces the VO2 max in naval cadets. Simultaneously, the same period without physical training increases both the tricipital skinfold thickness and the endomorphic component in this population."

Hip arthroscopy (HAS) has undergone tremendous technical advances, an immense increase in use and the indications are getting wider. The most common indications for revision arthroscopy are labral tears and residual femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Treatment of borderline developmental dysplastic hip is currently a subject of controversy. It is paramount to understand the underlining problem of the individual hip and distinguish instability (dysplasia) from FAI, as the appropriate treatment for unstable hips is periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) and for FAI arthroscopic impingement surgery. PAO with a concomitant cam resection is associated with a higher survival rate compared to PAO alone for the treatment of hip dysplasia. Further, the challenge for the surgeon is the balance between over- and undercorrection. Femoral torsion abnormalities should be evaluated and evaluation of femoral rotational osteotomy for these patients should be incorporated to the treatment plan.

Purpose: To investigate the association between osteoarthritis and participating in sports not listed in previous reviews: American football, archery, baseball, bobsleigh, curling, handball, ice hockey, shooting, skeleton, speed skating, and wrestling. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We searched 4 electronic databases and hand searched recent/in-press editions of relevant journals. The criteria for study selection were case-control studies, cohort studies, nested case-control studies, and randomized trials with a control group that included adults to examine the effect of exposure to any of the included sports on the development of osteoarthritis. Results: The search returned 6197 articles after deduplication. Nine studies were included in the final review, covering hip, knee, and ankle osteoarthritis. There were no studies covering archery, baseball, skeleton, speed skating, or curling. The 6 sports included in the review were analyzed as a collective; the results of the meta-analysis indicated that participation in the sports analyzed was associated with an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis of the hip (relative risk [RR] = 1.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-2.41]; P = .04), knee (RR = 1.60 [95% CI, 1.23-2.08]; P &lt; .001), and ankle (RR = 7.08 [95% CI, 1.24-40.51]; P = .03) as compared with controls. Meta-analysis suggested a significantly increased likelihood of developing hip osteoarthritis through participating in wrestling (RR = 1.78 [95% CI, 1.20-2.64]; P = .004) and ice hockey (RR = 1.70 [95% CI, 1.27-2.29]; P &lt; .001), while there was no significant difference through participating in handball (RR = 2.50 [95% CI, 0.85-7.36]; P = .10). Likelihood of developing knee osteoarthritis was significantly increased in wrestling (RR = 2.22 [95% CI, 1.59-3.11]) and ice hockey (RR = 1.52 [95% CI, 1.18-1.96]; both P &lt; .002). According to the meta-analysis, shooting did not have a significant effect on the RR of knee osteoarthritis as compared with other sports (RR = 0.43 [95% CI, 0.06-2.99]; P = .39). Conclusion: The likelihood of developing hip and knee osteoarthritis was increased for ice hockey and wrestling athletes, and the risk of developing hip osteoarthritis was increased for handball athletes. The study also found that participation in the sports examined, as a collective, resulted in an increased risk of developing hip, knee, and ankle osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3167041789,The Neuroplastic Adaptation Trident Model: A Suggested Novel Framework for ACL Rehabilitation,2021-06-01,2021,article,"Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are common in athletic populations and there are many factors that contribute to a return to play decision. Human movement is diverse and variable, and it is important for patients recovering from an ACL injury to develop a variety of movement strategies for athletic performance. Variability of movement during sport may help to decrease injury risk by preparing the individual to handle many different situations and improve problem solving. ACL injuries result in neurophysiological dysfunction due to a disruption of the afferent information from the native mechanoreceptors in the ligament. Following injury, the brain enters a neuroplastic state and can adapt and change positively or negatively based on the rehabilitation or lack thereof. This commentary presents a novel framework for rehabilitation called the Neuroplastic Adaptation Trident Model that takes into account respected methods for attempting to achieve positive neuroplastic changes. This structured framework provides clinicians with reproducible methods to employ as part of the rehabilitation process to maximize motor control and motor learning. Suggested dosage and implementation are proposed to lead to a consistent and gradually progressive challenge throughout the entire rehabilitation process that takes advantage of the time from surgery until return to play. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to describe the Neuroplastic Adaptation Trident model and provide examples for clinical implementation. This method should be studied further to determine true effectiveness; currently, it is presented as a theoretical model based on best current evidence regarding ACL injury and rehabilitation of neurophysiologic dysfunction."

In professional athletes, rehabilitation following OCA is a critical component of the process of returning the athlete to full sports activity and requires a multidisciplinary team approach with frequent communication between the surgical and rehabilitation teams (physical therapists, athletic trainers, coaching staff). In this review, we describe our five-phase approach to progressive rehabilitation of the professional athlete after OCA, which takes into account the biological processes of healing and optimization of neuromuscular function required for the demands of elite-level sport. The principles of early range of motion, proper progression through the kinetic chain, avoidance of pain and effusion, optimization of movement, regimen individuation, and integration of sports-specific activities underlie proper recovery."

Specific hamstring strength exercises may show high ST activity, however the effect of unilateral vs. bilateral exercise execution on ST activation remains unknown. # Purpose To investigate selected lower limb strengthening exercises performed either unilaterally or bilaterally to identify 1) which exercise elicited the highest hamstring activation, 2) which exercise elicited the highest ST activation, and 3) to examine if unilateral exercise execution altered the medio-lateral hamstring activation pattern. Furthermore, the kinematic characteristics of each specific exercise and execution modality were determined to reveal possible causes for differences in medio-lateral hamstring activation between the different exercise conditions. # Study design Cross-sectional study. # Methods Single-session repeated measures were obtained in a randomized manner. Twenty-three female elite team handball players were recruited. Hamstring electromyographic (EMG) activity and 3D kinematics were obtained during selected lower limb exercises (hip thrust, kettlebell swing, Romanian deadlift). Hamstring EMG activity, normalized to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) (nEMG), and inter-muscular activation difference between the ST and lateral hamstring biceps femoris (BF) were compared across exercises using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. # Results Bilateral hip thrust demonstrated highest overall hamstring activity (68.9&#177;16.6 %). Kettlebell swing (Δ13%-point, p\<0.01) and Romanian deadlift (Δ20-24%-point, p\<0.01) demonstrated greater ST-BF activation differences (Δ=ST-BF) in favor of ST compared to hip thrust (Δ2-7%). Positive correlations were observed between knee joint angle and ST activity in kettlebell swing and deadlift. # Conclusion Kettlebell swing, deadlift and hip thrust all produced high activation of the hamstring muscles. Kettlebell swing and both deadlift exercises were superior in activating ST over BF, favoring these exercises in the prevention of non-contact ACL injury in female athletes, which should be evaluated in future intervention studies. # Level of evidence 3"

There has been no investigation into high school baseball coaches' usage and perceptions of arm care programs to mitigate physical impairments associated with injuries in baseball players.The purpose of this study was to investigate the current usage of arm care programs by high school baseball coaches. The primary objective was to determine if coaches use group-based or individualized arm care programs. The secondary objective sought to determine if the use of arm care programs is influenced by coaches' age, education, and experience level. Finally, this study explored the potential barriers to arm care implementation and high school baseball coaches' current awareness and beliefs of injury prevention.Descriptive cross-sectional survey.A 29-item online survey was emailed to 18,500 high school baseball coaches throughout the United States. Data were collected for three months, and the response rate was 3.7%.A total of 87.3% (n=571/654) of responding coaches use arm care programs with their players. Of coaches performing arm care, only 18.5% of 571 individualize their arm care exercises based on specific player needs. However, older and more experienced coaches are more likely to individualize their programs. Among the 12.7% (n=83/654) of coaches who do not use arm care programs, the two most commonly cited reasons for not implementing arm care were lack of observed benefit (41%) and insufficient staff (31%). Although 42% of 654 coaches recognized reduced shoulder mobility as a major contributor to injury, risk factors such as throwing with a fatigued arm, previous injury history, and throwing > 8 months per year were not consistently identified as primary risk factors.The results of this study suggest that the majority high school baseball coaches implement group-based arm care exercise programs to prevent injury. Lack of confidence in the effectiveness and staffing limitations were major barriers to implementation of arm care programming. However, the responding coaches exhibited inconsistent risk factor awareness and dated injury prevention beliefs. Therefore, better educational collaboration between rehabilitation professionals and high school coaches regarding injury risk factors and preventative strategies is warranted.Level 3."

However, the mechanisms of injury protection provided by the ankle braces in the basketball game are still unknown. Objectives: To analyze the effects of wearing a lace-up ankle brace, and to conduct an exercise protocol that simulated the intensity of the basketball game on ground reaction force (GRF) during basketball-specific vertical jumps. Methods: Eleven male younger basketball players aged under 18 completed 48 vertical jumps, with and without ankle braces, during an exercise protocol composed of four 10-minute periods, simulating the activity profile and intensity of the basketball game as well as the typical intervals between periods. Mediolateral (variables: the greatest medial and lateral peaks) and vertical (variables: vertical peak, impulse peak, impulse at 50 ms of landing, loading rate and jump height) GRF were measured during takeoff and landing for all the jumps performed in the exercise protocol. Results: The use of the ankle brace reduced mediolateral GRF in all periods of the exercise protocol during takeoff and landing ( P &lt; 0.05), without affecting the vertical GRF ( P &gt; 0.05). Mediolateral and vertical GRF (takeoff mediolateral vertical peaks, landing mediolateral peaks, landing impulse peak, takeoff and landing loading rate) increased significantly during four subsequent 10-minute periods ( P &lt; 0.05). However, for mediolateral GRF, the increase overtime was higher without braces. Conclusions: The use of the ankle brace reduced the mediolateral GRF on the lower limb, while there was a progressive increase in the external load applied to the body during the vertical jumps in the subsequent periods of the exercise protocol performed at the same intensity of the basketball game.

Nomenclature, though inconsistent, identifies mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on acute diagnostic criteria, whereas a sport-related concussion (SRC) is event-related and specific to mTBI experienced while participating in athletic activity. The effects of SRC are often neurological, neuropsychological and/or psychiatric with a variety of symptoms. Different organizations categorize these symptoms differently and this variance demonstrates that no uniform clinical classification system has been agreed upon. Diagnosis of SRC is based on clinical examination. Numerous symptom checklists and assessments are available for clinical diagnosis, but their validity is somewhat limited. There is increasing awareness regarding the psychiatric deficits associated with SRC and the potential for developing post-concussion syndrome (PCS). In addition to complex, causal SRC-associated symptoms, reactive psychological complaints may also occur, as well as social mistreatment on recovery from SRC. Pre-existing mental health conditions are associated with an increased risk for developing PCS. This often necessitates the implementation of psychiatric or psychotherapeutic care after SRC. As with mTBI and SRC, no standardized classification has been established for PCS. Multi-stage rehabilitation strategies can help injured athletes navigate a successful recovery and prevent premature return to play. Further research on the utility of psychotherapy, psychopharmacotherapy, and exercise therapy of PCS is needed. Key Words: Concussion, Mental Health, Post-Concussion Syndrome, Interdisciplinarity"

The data were collected in the first month of the academic year and after 12 months in the following order: Baecke Habitual Physical Activity Questionnaire, anthropometrics, and FMS. RESULTS: PFn assessment, from baseline to second assessment, revealed significant changes in Trunk Stability Push-up (p=0.003; ES=0.656) and total score (p=0.026; ES=0.497) for women and in Deep Squat (p=0.003; ES=0.334) for men. No significant changes were found in women PA levels. Men decreased in leisure PA (p=0.002; ES=0.538) and total PA (p=0.003; ES=0.519). CONCLUSION: Sports Science university students’ daily routines may mediate physical activity patterns with following physical function improvements or decrements, occurring due to contextual environments that over-or under-produce the stimulation required to develop those skills."

Previous studies predominantly focused on static testing setups, males, restricted age ranges and scarcely investigated the temporal area. This given study determined the biomechanical properties of 64 human neurocranial samples (age range of 3 weeks to 94 years) using testing velocities of 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 m/s in a three-point bending setup. Maximum forces were higher with increasing testing velocities (p ≤ 0.031) but bending strengths only revealed insignificant increases (p ≥ 0.052). The maximum force positively correlated with the sample thickness (p ≤ 0.012 at 2.0 m/s and 3.0 m/s) and bending strength negatively correlated with both age (p ≤ 0.041) and sample thickness (p ≤ 0.036). All parameters were independent of sex (p ≥ 0.120) apart from a higher bending strength of females (p = 0.040) for the 3.5 -m/s group. All parameters were independent of the post mortem interval (p ≥ 0.061). This study provides novel insights into the dynamic mechanical properties of distinct neurocranial bones over an age range spanning almost one century. It is concluded that the former are age-, site- and thickness-dependent, whereas sex dependence needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3164763871,"Speed, Change of Direction Speed and Reactive Agility in Adolescent Soccer Players: Age Related Differences",2021-05-30,2021,article,"There are a plethora of studies investigating agility in soccer; however, studies have rarely presented the reaction time in differentiating age groups in adolescent soccer players. We investigated age differences in reactive agility, speed, and change of direction speed (CODs), in a group of highly trained adolescent soccer players. A total of 75 adolescent male soccer players (aged 14–19 years) were recruited. The players were grouped based on their age to under 15 (U15; n = 27), under 17 (U17; n = 25), and under 19 (U19; n = 23) players. Players were tested for 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m sprint, CODs speed test, Illinois test, and reactive agility test (total and reaction time). Only the reactive agility test with a live tester (RAT live) and RAT live reaction time (RAT live RT) distinguished U19 from both groups, U17 (RAT live, p &lt; 0.01; RAT RT live, p &lt; 0.01) and U15 (RAT live, p &lt; 0.01; RAT RT live, p &lt; 0.01). Groups did not have different times for 5 m sprint, RAT light and RAT RT light, F = 0.472, 2.691, 1.023, respectively, p &gt; 0.05. Moreover, a significantly slower average performance of sprint 20, CODs left and right, and Illinois was also observed in U15 as compared to U17 and U19 (p &lt; 0.05). We can conclude that results in agility tests that include live testers can be a significant factor that differentiates between adolescent soccer players considering their age."

The purpose of the research is to determine the changes related to the value of the plantar surfaces, the pressures for the dominant and non-dominant lower segments, the positioning of the pressure center in relation to the support polygon and the imbalances in the sole of the foot. The testing was performed using the FreeMed baropodometric platform and the FreeStep by Sensor Medica software, in the last week of February 2021, at the Research Center for Human Performance within the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports, “Dunărea de Jos” University from Galați. Results: Placing the maximum pressure point / P.max in the forefoot area is an exception, only one case being reported with this distribution, the rest having P.max located at the rearfoot level. Comparison of the averages between the variables recorded for the left foot vs. the right foot highlights higher values of the dominant / right foot, but these differences are significant only for the values of the plantar pressure in the forefoot area and for the total load on the entire plantar surface / total load (p &lt;.05). The comparison between the averages of the surfaces and the loads of each separate foot (for the forefoot and rearfoot areas) highlights major differences only for the values of the contact surfaces, the forefoot area being significantly larger than the rearfoot area (p &lt;.05). Close average values with small and insignificant differences are reported for each foot between the forefoot and rearfoot areas when comparing the body pressure / load percent and weight ratio percent, indicating a balanced pressure distribution between the front and back area for each leg. The investigation was also useful by detecting the existing imbalances at the plantar level, for one or both legs, being also reported cases of hollow, flat and mixed foot. These plantar disturbances can negatively affect all the overlying / upper joints, but especially the body posture, thus being able to cause pain in the lumbar region, limiting the performance activity and causing even the withdrawal of the athletes. We recommend that after identifying the syndromes at the ankle joint, to implement personalized plantar supports, which should be introduced in sports shoes in order to balance the architecture of the foot sole.

Post Soccer-Specific Aerobic Field Test90 measures were repeated immediately, +24 hours, +48 hours, and +72 hours. The main effects for the recovery time and direction of stability were supplemented by regression modeling to describe the temporal pattern of recovery.Significant main effects for time were identified for all directions of stability (Overall Stability Index, A-P, and M-L) up to +48 hours postexercise (P ≤ .05). The quadratic pattern of temporal recovery highlights a minimum of 37.55 to 38.67 hours and maximum of 75.09 to 77.33 hours. Additionally, a main effect for direction of stability was observed, with significant differences identified between A-P and M-L stability at all time points (P ≤ .001).Reductions in directional dynamic stability +48 hours postfatigue highlight implications for training design, recovery strategies, and injury management for performance practitioners. Interestingly, A-P stability has been highlighted as being significantly reduced compared with M-L stability at all time points, regardless of the fatigue exposure. Practitioners should consider the reduction of stability in this plane in relation to common mechanisms of injury in the knee to inform injury-risk-reduction strategies."

Because EV composition reflects the state of its parental tissue, EVs possess an enormous diagnostic/prognostic potential to reveal pathophysiological conditions. However, a prerequisite for such usage of EVs is their detailed characterisation, including visualisation which is mainly achieved by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy (EM). Here we summarise the EV preparation protocols for AFM and EM bringing out the main challenges in the imaging of EVs, both in their natural environment as biofluid constituents and in a saline solution after EV isolation. In addition, we discuss approaches for EV imaging and identify the potential benefits and disadvantages when different AFM and EM methods are applied, including numerous factors that influence the morphological characterisation, standardisation, or formation of artefacts. We also demonstrate the effects of some of these factors by using cerebrospinal fluid as an example of human biofluid with a simpler composition. Here presented comparison of approaches to EV imaging should help to estimate the current state in morphology research of EVs from human biofluids and to identify the most efficient pathways towards the standardisation of sample preparation and microscopy modes."

With the incidence estimated at more than 3 million a year and at a rate of 2.15/1,000 in the U.S. alone, medical specialists and other healthcare providers caring for the foot and ankle must take notice. Despite the millions of ankle injuries sustained annually, the true incidence may be underestimated, as fewer than half of individuals with ankle sprains seek medical attention from healthcare professionals. The economic burden associated with the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment is close to $4 billion annually. Ankle sprains account for half of all sports injuries and remains a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the athlete. Accurate diagnosis is critical as 40% of ankle sprains are misdiagnosed or poorly treated leading to chronic ankle pain and disability. Implementing evidence supported diagnostic and treatment strategies is the goal for ensuring safe and rapid return to play. The Lateral Ankle Sprain (LAS) is among the most common type of ankle sprains suffered during athletic activities. Up to 80% of LAS are of the inversion type, and 75% lead to recurrence and instability. Although most individuals experiencing a LAS return to activity within six weeks, many report continued pain, diminished function, and instability. The purpose of this review is to highlight the epidemiology, pathoetiology, pathoanatomy, and biomechanics of the LAS, enabling sports physicians to implement the best practice guidelines and protocols to manage this common enigma."
https://openalex.org/W3164201181,State Transition Modeling in Ultimate Frisbee: Adaptation of a Promising Method for Performance Analysis in Invasion Sports,2021-05-25,2021,article,"Although the body of literature in sport science is growing rapidly, certain sports have yet to benefit from this increased interest by the scientific community. One such sport is Ultimate Frisbee, officially known as Ultimate. Thus, the goal of this study was to describe the nature of the sport by identifying differences between winning and losing teams in elite-level competition. To do so, a customized observational system and a state transition model were developed and applied to 14 games from the 2017 American Ultimate Disc League season. The results reveal that, on average, 262.2 passes were completed by a team per game and 5.5 passes per possession. More than two-thirds of these passes were played from the mid zone (39.4 ± 6.57%) and the rear zone (35.2 ± 5.09%), nearest the team’s own end zone. Winning and losing teams do not differ in these general patterns, but winning teams played significantly fewer backward passes from the front zone to the mid zone, nearest the opponent’s end zone than losing teams (mean difference of −4.73%, t (13) = −4.980, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = −1.16). Furthermore, losing teams scored fewer points when they started on defense, called breakpoints (mean difference of −5.57, t (13) = −6.365, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 2.30), and committed significantly more turnovers per game (mean difference of 5.64, t (13) = 5.85, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = −1.18). Overall, this study provides the first empirical description of Ultimate and identifies relevant performance indicators to discriminate between winning and losing teams. We hope this article sheds light on the unique, but so far overlooked sport of Ultimate, and offers performance analysts the basis for future studies using state transition modeling in Ultimate as well as other invasion sports."

Sports scientists and coaches need to find out more about the set of techniques, its diversity and the amount of technique in top level football games in order to guide the optimal planning and implementation of the training process in the technical training of football players. Due to the diversity of techniques used by football players, there are different approaches to the classification of these techniques. However, it is very important to group all techniques according to their common features in order to adequately assess the structure of a football game, its development tendencies and issues. Research aim: to compare and analyse the essence of the classification of football technique and its development tendencies. Research methods: analysis of scientific articles (electronic scientific databases ScienceDirect, Google Scholar), search keywords – football, football technique, classification of football technique. Main results of the research: two main approaches dominate in the classification of football technique: the technique approach and the game approach. Initially, football technique was mainly grouped by taking into account the player’s actions with or without the ball, the level of difficulty of the technique element, the role of the players and the player’s actions on the spot or in motion. As football develops, football technique is classified by taking into account the effectiveness of its application in specific tactical situations."

Due to its widespread applications in a great variety of areas, such as human motion analysis, human–computer interaction, robots, 3D human pose estimation has recently attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community, however, it is a challenging task due to depth ambiguities and the lack of in-the-wild datasets. A large number of approaches, with many based on deep learning, have been developed over the past decade, largely advancing the performance on existing benchmarks. To guide future development, a comprehensive literature review is highly desired in this area. However, existing surveys on 3D human pose estimation mainly focus on traditional methods and a comprehensive review on deep learning based methods remains lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of existing deep learning based works for 3D pose estimation, summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and provide an in-depth understanding of this area. Furthermore, we also explore the commonly-used benchmark datasets on which we conduct a comprehensive study for comparison and analysis. Our study sheds light on the state of research development in 3D human pose estimation and provides insights that can facilitate the future design of models and algorithms."

This study tests the hypothesis that patients with a history of concussion and persistent cognitive impairment have fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that are specifically associated with poor performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Methods: Fifty-three subjects (19 females) with concussions and persistent cognitive symptoms had MR imaging and the MoCA. Imaging was analyzed by atlas-based, whole-brain DTI segmentation and FLAIR lesion segmentation. Then, we conducted a random forest-based recursive feature elimination (RFE) with 10-fold cross-validation on the entire dataset, and with partial correlation adjustment for age and lesion load. Results: RFE showed that 11 DTI variables were found to be important predictors of MoCA scores. Partial correlation analyses, corrected for age and lesion load, showed significant correlations between MoCA scores and right fronto-temporal regions: inferior temporal gyrus MD ( r = −0.62, p = 0.00001), middle temporal gyrus MD ( r = −0.54, p = 0.0001), angular gyrus MD ( r = −0.48, p = 0.0008), and inferior frontal gyrus FA ( r = 0.44, p = 0.002). Discussion: This is the first study to demonstrate a correlation between MoCA scores and DTI variables in patients with a history of concussion and persistent cognitive impairment. This kind of research will significantly increase our understanding of why certain persons have persistent cognitive changes after concussion which, in turn, may allow us to predict persistent impairment after concussion and suggest new interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3171855472,Development and Evaluation of Cueing Symbology for Rotorcraft Operations in Degraded Visual Environment (DVE),2021-05-24,2021,preprint,"Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) is experienced when helicopters enter Inadvertent Instrument Meteorological Conditions (I-IMC). DVE can occur in the form of fog, night flight occurring naturally or when pilots try to land in unprepared (dusty, snowy) landing zones causing brownouts and whiteouts from rotor downwash. The Degraded Visual Environment Navigation Support (DVENS) project aimed to use a LiDAR to scan a specified Field of View (FOV) and range to identify a zone to be safe or unsafe for landing in a simulation capacity. A Head Down Display (HDD) with touch capabilities was used to provide Virtual Visual Meteorological Conditions (V-VMC), in which 3D conformal, 2D orthographic symbology is displayed. For the iterative design of the symbology, to diagnose and minimize pilot error in DVE the Taxonomic Framework for Aircrew Error evaluation is used. The framework allowed for a more direct design approach with clear objectives based on operational requirements and presenting an optimal workload for pilots. Maintaining the objective of showing the required information to the pilots while minimizing clutter is imperative as too much information can increase workload. Thus, the aircrew error Taxonomic framework helps identify the design goals required to neutralize pilot error leading to an efficient design. The Ryerson Mixed Immersive Motion Simulation (MIMS) lab’s Fixed Base Simulator (FBS) and CAE, Presagis’s HELI CRAFT were used as the simulation testing tools. Non-intrusive questionnaires such as NASA Task Load Index (TLX), Bedford and Cooper-Harper display rating scales were used to provide feedback and evaluate the display system. Multiple scales were used for validation of results and to measure the workload, stress, physical, psychological and time loads. This methodology and design were found to be extremely helpful in assisting pilots to land, take off in DVE and IIMC conditions."

Analytic impulse models are used to predict joint impulses which can be computed offline or online and serve as criteria for mode switching. Joint impulses are constrained in case the hammer collides with such an object of infinite effective mass. Advantages of the proposed approach may include savings on space, weight, costs, and complexity for a limited range of nail/board environments.

https://openalex.org/W3164130704,Identifying degenerative effects of repetitive head trauma with neuroimaging: a clinically-oriented review,2021-05-22,2021,review,"Abstract Background and Scope of Review Varying severities and frequencies of head trauma may result in dynamic acute and chronic pathophysiologic responses in the brain. Heightened attention to long-term effects of head trauma, particularly repetitive head trauma, has sparked recent efforts to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of underlying disease processes. Imaging modalities like structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the most clinically applicable given their use in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and differentiation. In recent years, researchers have targeted repetitive head trauma cohorts in hopes of identifying in vivo biomarkers for underlying biologic changes that might ultimately improve diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in living persons. These populations most often include collision sport athletes (e.g., American football, boxing) and military veterans with repetitive low-level blast exposure. We provide a clinically-oriented review of neuroimaging data from repetitive head trauma cohorts based on structural MRI, FDG-PET, Aβ-PET, and tau-PET. We supplement the review with two patient reports of neuropathology-confirmed, clinically impaired adults with prior repetitive head trauma who underwent structural MRI, FDG-PET, Aβ-PET, and tau-PET in addition to comprehensive clinical examinations before death. Review Conclusions Group-level comparisons to controls without known head trauma have revealed inconsistent regional volume differences, with possible propensity for medial temporal, limbic, and subcortical (thalamus, corpus callosum) structures. Greater frequency and severity (i.e., length) of cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is observed in repetitive head trauma cohorts compared to unexposed controls. It remains unclear whether CSP predicts a particular neurodegenerative process, but CSP presence should increase suspicion that clinical impairment is at least partly attributable to the individual’s head trauma exposure (regardless of underlying disease). PET imaging similarly has not revealed a prototypical metabolic or molecular pattern associated with repetitive head trauma or predictive of CTE based on the most widely studied radiotracers. Given the range of clinical syndromes and neurodegenerative pathologies observed in a subset of adults with prior repetitive head trauma, structural MRI and PET imaging may still be useful for differential diagnosis (e.g., assessing suspected Alzheimer’s disease)."

We retrospectively reviewed all patients &lt; 18 years, with primary or recurrent pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), undergoing PEPSiT in the period 2017–2020. All patients received pre-operative laser therapy, PEPSiT and post-operative dressing and laser therapy. Success rate, healing rate/time, post-operative management, short- and long-term outcome and patient satisfaction were assessed. A total of 152 patients (98 boys) were included. Median patient’s age was 17.1 years. Fifteen/152 patients (9.8%) presented a recurrent PSD. All patients resumed full daily activities 1 day after surgery. The post-operative course was painless in 100% of patients (median VAS pain score &lt; 2/10). Patient satisfaction was excellent (median score 4.8). The median follow-up was 12.8 months (range 1–36). Complete healing in 8 weeks was achieved in 145/152 (95.4%) and the median healing time was 24.6 days (range 16–31). We reported post-operatively immediate Clavien grade 2 complications (3 oedema, 2 burns) in 5/152 (3.3%) and delayed Clavien grade 2 complications (3 granulomas, 8 wound infections) in 11/152 (7.2%). Disease recurrence occurred in 7/152 (4.6%), who were re-operated using PEPSiT. PEPSiT should be considered the standard of care for surgical treatment of PSD in children and teenagers. PEPSiT is technically easy, with short and painless post-operative course and low recurrence rate (4.6%). Standardized treatment protocol, correct patient enrollment and information, and intensive follow-up are key points for the success of the procedure."

It tackles the question of how to build Olympic stadia with lower embodied energy and qualities of stewardship, adaptability, flexibility and modality while maintaining multi-functionality."
https://openalex.org/W3163276626,Effects of Tissue Flossing on the Healthy and Impaired Musculoskeletal System: A Scoping Review,2021-05-21,2021,review,"There is a belief that tissue flossing can improve the range of motion or performance, speed up recovery, and decrease the pain caused by various diseases or injuries. As a result, many therapists, patients, and athletes are now using this technique. Consequently, in the last 5 years, a number of studies have addressed these assumptions. The purpose of this scoping review is to introduce the application of a floss band and to summarize the existing evidence for the effect of floss band treatment on the range of motion, performance, recovery, and pain (due to disease or injuries). A further goal is to suggest what needs to be addressed in future studies. The online search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Any studies dealing with the effects of a floss band treatment on the range of motion, performance, recovery, or pain parameters in any population (e.g., patients, athletes) were included in this review. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 513 participants. The included studies revealed that there is evidence that a single floss band treatment is able to increase the range of motion of the related joint and can positively affect jumping and strength performance. However, these findings show only small to moderate effect sizes. Although not yet clearly understood, a possible mechanism for such changes in the range of motion or performance is likely due to changed neuromuscular function, rather than changed mechanical properties, of the muscle (e.g., stiffness). All in all, there is a need to conduct long-term studies about the effects of flossing treatment on the range of motion and performance (e.g., strength or jumping parameters) and its related mechanism (e.g., pain tolerance). There is weak evidence that flossing can be of value for pain relief in the treatment of certain diseases and for speeding up recovery after exercise. Moreover, there is weak evidence that flossing might have a superior conditioning (warm-up) effect compared to stretching when the goal is to improve the range of motion or certain aspects of muscle strength, while no such superior effect has been reported when compared to foam rolling."

A mixed-methods study was conducted to determine the influence of participation in SSPs on the educational outcomes of lower secondary students in Western Australia. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in specialist students' mean grade for Mathematics over the course of a year, while their mean grade for all other subjects, and their level of engagement with school, remained stable over the same period of time. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with key stakeholders (e.g., specialist students and their parents, as well as teachers and graduates of the SSPs). Overall, the participants felt that SSPs had a positive influence on students' engagement with school, and that this engagement had a positive impact on their academic achievement. Taken together, the results of this research suggest that there is a role for SSPs in promoting positive educational outcomes for lower secondary students attending public schools located in low SES areas."

However, whether the rater’s experience noticeably influences the reliability and precision of LMM EI measurements has not been established. The aims of this study were to investigate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of LMM EI measurements, and to compare the reliability and SEM between a novice and an experienced rater. Materials and Methods: Twenty athletes (10 females, 10 males) with a history of LBP were included in this study. Transverse ultrasound images of LMM were taken at L5 in prone. LMM EI measurements were obtained bilaterally by tracing the maximum ROI representing the LMM cross-sectional area (CSA), avoiding the inclusion of bone or surrounding fascia. All measurements were performed by two novice raters and an experienced researcher. Each measurement was acquired by each rater three times for each side on three different images, and the average was used in the analyses. Raters were blinded to each other’s measurements and the participant’s clinical information. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were obtained to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Results: The intra-rater ICC values for the LMM measurements for the experienced rater were excellent (ICC all &gt; 0.997). The inter-rater reliability ICC values showed moderate to excellent reliability (0.614 to 0.994) and agreement between the novice raters and the experienced rater, except for Novice 1 for the right LMM, which revealed lower ICCs and a wider 95% CI. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability results were similar when separately looking at the right and left side of the muscle and participant gender. Conclusions: Our findings support the clinical use of ultrasound imaging for the assessment of LMM EI in individuals with LBP."
https://openalex.org/W4205935167,Precision strength training: Data-driven artificial intelligence approach to strength and conditioning,2021-05-20,2021,preprint,"In strength training, personalised strength training (autoregulation) approaches have been used to individualise exercise programs with monitoring for dynamic adjustment based on the individual response to training. While this transition from tradition-based training to evidence-based training framework has been an improvement in training practices, we argue that the future of strength training will also incorporate deep learning models powered by data. We refer to this data-driven framework as precision strength training inspired by the similar modeling frameworks used in precision medicine. In contrast to current personalised training in which the acquired athlete data is often subject to human expert decision-making, we are anticipating the rise of human-in-the-loop systems with an augmented coach who will be doing decisions collaboratively with the machine. Similar to other precision frameworks, such as precision health, we envision such a future to take decades to be realised and we focus here on practical short-term targets on a way to long-term realisation. In this chapter, we will review the measurement technology needed for continuous data acquisition from an individual during training/physical activity, how to acquire these datasets for the development of such systems and, how a proof-of-concept system could be developed for powerlifting training with applicability to general strength and conditioning (S&amp;amp;C) and physical rehabilitation purposes. Additionally, we will evaluate how the user experience (UX) of the system feedback and visualisation could be designed."
https://openalex.org/W3160568632,The Influence of Active Hamstring Stiffness on Markers of Isotonic Muscle Performance,2021-05-20,2021,article,"Background: Previous research demonstrates hamstring muscle-tendon stiffness (HMTS) influences isometric strength, landing biomechanics and architectural tissue properties. However, the influence on kinetics &amp; kinematics during other modes of strength testing (isotonic dynamometry) has yet to be established. Purpose: Investigate how HMTS influences kinetics and kinematics during a novel isotonic muscle performance test which has never been done for the hamstrings. Previous work using dynamometry has been limited to isometric or isokinetic contractions, so the novelty arises from our custom isotonic protocol which allows quantitative assessment of the stretch-shortening cycle. Methods: Twenty-six recreationally active individuals (15 males, 11 females, 23.8 ± 2.5 years) completed baseline testing for anthropometry and maximum isometric hamstring strength (MVIC). At least 48 h later, subjects completed a measure of HMTS (damped oscillation technique) followed by an isotonic knee flexion test (eccentric velocity 180°/s; concentric torque 25% of MVIC). Separate linear regression models with examination of residuals were conducted between HMTS and each muscle performance variable. Standardized coefficients determined the magnitude of the relationships. Results: Significance was found for all outcome variables tested. HMTS and rate of torque development demonstrated the strongest relationship followed by isotonic concentric peak torque. The weakest relationship observed was with isometric peak torque. Conclusions: These findings build off previous work quantifying HMTS by showing HMTS more strongly relates to dynamic versus static muscle testing and identifies the potential clinical utility of isotonic dynamometry."

Outcome was evaluated retrospectively after a minimum follow-up of 24 months using KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, clinical examination, outcome scores (Lysholm score, Tegner Activity Scale), and a questionnaire about sport activities.A total of 23 patients (44% male, 57% female) with a mean age of 25 ± 15 years were included. Mean follow-up was 57 ± 25 months. KT-1000 arthrometer measurements of anterior tibial translation revealed a mean side-to-side difference of 0.9 ± 1.0 mm. Clinical examination showed 100% normal or nearly normal anterior translation of the tibia. Two patients (9%) received an ACL reconstruction due to traumatic ACL re-instability and were, therefore, considered as failures. An extension deficit concerning hyperextension occurred in 29% of patients postoperatively. Further postoperative complications occurred in 14% of patients and included postoperative stiffness with ROM limitations and secondary dislocation of a fragment. Mean postoperative Lysholm score was 89 ± 14. Comparing pre- and postoperative values, no significant change of the Tegner Activity Scale was observed. All patients (failures excluded) returned to high impact sports activities after ARIF.Excellent reliable ligamentous stability and high rates of return to high impact sports can be expected after ARIF using a suture fixation technique for type II-IV tibial eminence fractures. Complications, such as limitations in ROM, commonly occur in up to 30% after ARIF. Therefore, regular follow-up examinations remain important in this usually young patient cohort.Level IV."

This scoping review aims (i) to map the literature that addresses the effects on reduction of back problems following athlete training with differing demands on the core musculature and (ii) to identify gaps in the existing literature and propose future research on this topic. The main literature search was conducted on the MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases and was completed on Elsevier, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. A total of 21 research articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings of 17 studies identified that core strengthening and core stabilization exercises, alone or in combination with athlete training, contribute to the reduction of back pain in athletes, whereas only four studies revealed no significant association of core muscle strength and/or endurance with back problems. Nevertheless, more research is warranted to elucidate the pros and cons of purely sport-specific training with differing demands on the core musculature on back health in athletes. This could help us to design prevention strategies specifically tailored to individual athletes."

Although significant strides have been made in the identification and management of concussion, less is known about the primary prevention of this condition. The aims of this scoping review are to (1) summarize the current research of physical conditioning strategies to reduce or prevent concussion incidence in individuals participating in sport, especially adolescents, and (2) to identify gaps in the knowledge base. Our research question was what is known from the existing literature about physical preparation strategies to reduce or prevent concussion in adult and adolescent sports? Three literature searches were conducted by information officers at two universities at six-month intervals, using five electronic databases (PubMed; WorldCat.org ; Mendeley; EBSCOHost and Ovid MEDLINE). To increase the search range, subject experts were consulted and articles and reference lists were hand searched. A scoping review methodology identified eligible studies that analyzed physical preparation techniques on modifiable physical risk factors in athletes to reduce the incidence of concussion. The PRISMA-ScR checklist guided the reporting of the findings. A total of 1414 possible articles were identified, after duplicates removed, and articles analyzed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 9 articles qualified for analysis. Two articles were found from studying reference lists. Thus, a total of 11 articles were included in the final evaluation for the purposes of this study. Data are reported from mostly adolescent subjects participating in nine different sports from three countries. Findings are presented with specific reference to previously recognized modifiable risk factors of concussion which include neck strength, neck size, cervical stiffness, type of sport, and pre-activity exercises. There is limited research examining the physical preparation of athletes, especially in adolescents, to reduce or prevent concussion, and conflicting evidence in the few small sample studies that were identified. This scoping review identifies the research gap for a potentially vital modifiable risk factor, notably in the physical preparation of children and adolescents to reduce or prevent sports-related concussion."

PlayerLoadRT was evaluated at six anatomical locations simultaneously (interscapular line, lumbar region, knees and ankles) by six WIMU PROTM inertial devices attached to the player using an ad hoc integral suit. Statistical analysis was composed of an ANOVA of repeated measures and partial eta squared effect sizes. Significant differences among anatomical locations were found in all tests with higher values in the location nearer to ground contact (p &lt; 0.01). However, differences between lower limb locations were only found in curvilinear movements, with a higher workload in the outside leg (p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, high between-subject variability was found in team players, especially at lower limb locations. In conclusion, multi-location evaluation in sports movements will make it possible to establish an individual external workload profile and design specific strategies for training and injury prevention programs."

Despite the advancements in injury prevention programs, the rate of ACL injuries continues to rise. Purpose: To provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms, situational pattern, and biomechanics of ACL injuries in women’s soccer. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We identified 57 consecutive ACL injuries that occurred in matches of 6 top female leagues across 3 seasons (2017-2020). A total of 35 (61%) injury videos were analyzed for the mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 29 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. The distribution of ACL injuries according to month, timing within the match, and field location at the time of injury was also reported. Results: In the 35 injury videos, there were 19 (54%) noncontact injuries, 12 (34%) indirect contact injuries, and 4 (11%) direct contact injuries. We identified 3 main situations in players who suffered a noncontact/indirect contact injury: (1) pressing and tackling (n = 18), (2) regaining balance after kicking (n = 7), and (3) being tackled (n = 4). Biomechanical analysis indicated multiplanar mechanisms with frequent knee valgus loading (88%). Additionally, 64% of injuries occurred in the first half of matches and most frequently within the first 30 minutes. Conclusion: Female athletes showed remarkable similarities with elite male players in terms of the ACL mechanism and situational pattern of injury, and 88% of injuries involved no direct contact to the knee, with noncontact injuries being highly prevalent. Injuries occurred during 3 main situations, with accompanying alterations in multiplanar biomechanics. Interventions aimed at reducing ACL injuries in women’s soccer should consider high-intensity defensive play at the beginning of a match. Instruction in the 3 main situations should be applied alongside appropriate neuromuscular training interventions."

Recent developments of statistical methods for functional data allow for novel ways to analyze often complex biomechanical data. Even so, for such methods as well as for traditional well-established statistical methods, the interpretations of the results may be influenced by analysis choices made prior to the analysis. We evaluated the consequences of three such choices when comparing one-leg vertical hop (OLVH) performance in individuals who had ruptured their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), to that of asymptomatic controls, and also athletes. Kinematic data were analyzed using a statistical approach for functional data, targeting entire curve data. This was done not only for one joint at a time but also for multiple lower limb joints and movement planes simultaneously using a multi-aspect methodology, testing for group differences while also accounting for covariates. We present the results of when an individual representative curve out of three available was either: (1) a mean curve ( Mean ), (2) a curve from the highest hop ( Max ), or (3) a curve describing the variability ( Var ), as a representation of performance stability. We also evaluated choice of sample leg comparison; e.g., ACL-injured leg compared to either the dominant or non-dominant leg of asymptomatic groups. Finally, we explored potential outcome effects of different combinations of included joints. There were slightly more pronounced group differences when using Mean compared to Max , while the specifics of the observed differences depended on the outcome variable. For Var there were less significant group differences. Generally, there were more disparities throughout the hop movement when comparing the injured leg to the dominant leg of controls, resulting in e.g., group differences for trunk and ankle kinematics, for both Mean and Max . When the injured leg was instead compared to the non-dominant leg of controls, there were trunk, hip and knee joint differences. For a more stringent comparison, we suggest considering to compare the injured leg to the non-dominant leg. Finally, the multiple-joint analyses were coherent with the single-joint analyses. The direct effects of analysis choices can be explored interactively by the reader in the Supplementary Material . To summarize, the choices definitively have an impact on the interpretation of a hop test results commonly used in rehabilitation following knee injuries. We therefore strongly recommend well-documented methodological analysis choices with regards to comparisons and representative values of the measures of interests."

When identifying risk factors, effective, easy, valid, reliable methods applicable to a large number of participants should be used. The purpose of this study was to compare the landing pattern of elite-youth soccer players using the landing error scoring system (LESS) which is a valid and reliable qualitative screening method. 95 volunteer elite-youth soccer players (U19, U17, U16 &amp; U15) between the ages of 14 and 18 participated in this study. Jump-landings were recorded by two camcorders from sagittal and frontal planes. These records were replayed and scored by a trained rater on LESS score sheets. There were statistically significant differences in LESS scores among the soccer age groups (p = 0.00). Post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant differences between U19 and U17 (p = 0.00), U17 and U15 (p = 0.00) and U16 and U15 (p = 0.01) soccer players. The best LESS score was found in U17 players and U15 players had the weakest score. The higher LESS score of the U15 players may be related to the neuromuscular control ability however, more evidence is needed to confirm the potential influence of age categories on LESS scores."

Methods: A total of 91 Swedish elite gymnasts (junior female, n = 26, age = 15.4 y; senior female, n = 23, age = 20.0 y; junior male, n = 19, age = 15.6 y; senior male, n = 23, age = 20.6 y) participated in three testing sessions on three separate days. These were: (1) a series of flexibility tests for the lower- and upper-body; (2) strength tests for the lower- and upper-body; and (3) various types of jumps, a 20-m sprint-run, and a 3,000-m run test. Results: Males were 24% stronger in the back squat one-repetition maximum (relative to body mass) compared to females (P < 0.001, Hg = 1.35). In the pull-ups and dips, 2.4 and 2.3 times more repetitions were completed by the males compared to the females (both P < 0.001, 0.70 ≤ R ≤ 0.77). However, females were similarly strong as males in the hanging sit-ups test (P = 0.724). The males jumped 29, 34, 33, and 17% higher in the squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJa), and drop jump (DJ), respectively, compared to the females (all P ≤ 0.002, 0.14 ≤ ηp2 ≤ 0.60). In the 20-m sprint run, males were 4% faster than females (P < 0.001, R = 0.40). Moreover, the females had significantly better flexibility than the males in the trunk forward bending, front split, and side split tests (all P < 0.001, 0.24 ≤ ηp2 ≤ 0.54). In the 3,000-m run test, males were 11% faster than females (P < 0.001, ηp2 ≤ 0.54). Compared to junior athletes, seniors performed better in the pull-ups, dips, SJ, CMJ, CMJa, and 20-m sprint-run tests (all P ≤ 0.012, 0.31 ≤ R ≤ 0.56, 0.16 ≤ ηp2 ≤ 0.25), with separate within-sex age-group differences (i.e., juniors vs. seniors) that were significant for the males but not for the females in the SJ, CMJ, CMJa, and 20-m sprint-run tests (males: all P < 0.001, 0.67 ≤ R ≤ 0.69, 1.37 ≤ Hg ≤ 2.01; females: all P = 0.298-732). Conclusions: Large sex and age-group differences were observed for most physical performance metrics with specific within-sex age-group differences only observed for male athletes, with male seniors performing better than juniors in the SJ, CMJ, CMJa, and 20-m sprint-run tests."

Functional performance testing can provide quantitative information on specialized sport movements. The single-leg, medial countermovement jump is an objective measure of frontal plane force, velocity and power, and is particularly applicable for ice hockey players given that ice skating involves applying lateral forces. This study assessed the short-term reliability (10 days) of the single-leg, medial countermovement jump performed by ten competitive male youth ice hockey players. Each participant performed three right and three left maximal single-leg, medial countermovement jumps from force plates. Measured variables included lateral and vertical takeoff velocity, lateral and vertical maximal force, maximal force above bodyweight, lateral and vertical peak concentric power, average concentric power, and average concentric power during the last 100 ms of push-off. Relative reliability was quantified by intraclass correlations. Absolute reliability and the smallest real difference were also calculated. The single-leg, medial countermovement jump had moderate-to-excellent test–retest reliability (ICC: 0.50–0.98) for all twelve variables of interest. These results suggest that the single-leg, medial countermovement jump is a reliable test for assessing frontal plane force, velocity and power in ice hockey players, and is a valid functional performance test for this population given the similarity to ice skating."

These fractures are often the result of a low-energy trauma with external rotation and supination mechanism. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic exam. Stress X-rays have a role in detecting associated mortise instability. Management depends on fracture type, displacement and associated ankle instability. For simple, minimally displaced fractures without ankle instability, conservative treatment leads to excellent results. Conservative treatment must also be considered in overaged unhealthy patients, even in unstable fractures. Surgical treatment is indicated when fracture or ankle instability are present, with several techniques described. Outcome is excellent in most cases. Complications regarding wound healing are frequent, especially with plate fixation, whereas other complications are uncommon."

Methods: The study examined the distribution of the pressure of the part of the foot on the ground, the arch of the foot, and the analysis of the body composition of the boys. The pressure center for both feet and the whole body was also examined. The study involved 90 youth footballers from Olsztyn and Barczewo in three age groups: 8–10 years, 11–13 years old, and 14–16 years. The study used the Inbody 270 body composition analyzer and the EPSR1, a mat that measures the pressure distribution of the feet on the ground. Results: The results showed statistically significant differences in almost every case for each area of the foot between the groups of the examined boys. The most significant differences were observed for the metatarsal area and the left heel. In the case of stabilization of the whole body, statistically significant differences were noted between all study groups. In the case of the body composition parameters, in the examined boys, a coherent direction of changes was noticed for most of them. The relationships and correlations between the examined parameters were also investigated. The significance level in the study was set at p &lt; 0.05. Conclusions: Under the training rigor, a statistically significant increase in stability was observed with age. The total length of the longitudinal arch of both feet of the examined boys showed a tendency to flatten in direct proportion to the age of the examined boys. Mean values of the body composition parameters reflect changes with the ontogenetic development, basic somatic parameters (body height and weight) and training experience, and thus with the intensity and volume of training. This indicates a correct training process that does not interfere with the proper development of the body in terms of tissue and biochemical composition."

It also provides a description of the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) anthropometry survey in Part IV, conclusions in Part V and concludes with the measurement technique protocols and normative data for the NZDF kinanthropometry survey in Part VI. While surface anthropometry has traditionally been used to assess body composition through the internationally recognised methodology of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK), the commercialisation of three-dimensional photometry (3D scanning) has led to the adoption of new and often non-standardised, measurement techniques. We detail standardisation procedures for 3D scanning in terms of participant preparation, equipment calibration, test protocols, data reporting and data interpretation. We outline how 3D scanning works, what it is used to measure, and what the issues are surrounding its validity, practicality, and reliability. This book provides an essential reference for practitioners wishing to measure military physique. We have not presented 3-D assessment data (i.e. surface manifold, volumetric, symmetry or shape analysis). We have only extracted 1-D measures from 3D images in this eBook."

In addition to the vocabulary in general language, a person must also master the knowledge of concepts that form the theoretical basis of the profession in question as well as the terms assigned to these concepts, first in one’s native language and then in the foreign one. The first aim of the research in this paper was to determine how respondents assessed the import of each sub-skill within the four groups of basic language skills – reading, writing, listening and speaking on the one hand, and on the other to determine the weight of knowledge of sports management-specific terminology in a foreign language for working in sports management in the Republic of Croatia. The second objective was to establish, also in the context of sports management, the correlation between the estimated importance of each of the four language skills and the estimated importance of the knowledge of sports management-specific vocabulary. The sample consisted of 70 students (men: n = 44; women: n = 26) of the fourth and fifth study years at the Faculty of Kinesiology, the University of Zagreb. The students filled out a questionnaire consisting of 58 items. They rated the relevance of all the sub-skills within the four basic language skills with the highest ratings. As for the order of skills given their criticality, the results indicated that the subjects considered reading skills as the most important, followed by listening, speaking and finally writing. The respondents also assessed the significance of the command of sports management-specific vocabulary with the highest rating. However, contrary to expectations, the analysis pointed to a low or only marginally moderate correlation between the assessed merit of each of the four language skills and the assessed weight of knowledge of the sports management-specific vocabulary."
https://openalex.org/W3162853338,Effects of a neuromuscular training program using external focus attention cues in male athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a randomized clinical trial,2021-05-08,2021,article,"Abstract Background Athletes who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction often exhibit persistent altered biomechanics and impaired function. Neuromuscular training programs appear to be effective for reducing high-risk landing mechanics and preventing primary ACL injuries; however, there have been few attempts to examine their effects in athletes who have undergone ACL reconstruction. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of a neuromuscular training program that emphasizes external focus of attention cuing on biomechanics, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function in athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation. Methods Twenty-four male athletes who had undergone primary, unilateral, hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation were randomly allocated to an experimental group ( n = 12) who took part in an 8-week neuromuscular training program or a control group ( n = 12) who continued a placebo program. The neuromuscular training program included lower extremity strengthening and plyometric exercises, balance training, and movement pattern re-training. Biomechanics during single-leg landing, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function were assessed before and after the 8-week training period. Results Athletes in the experimental group demonstrated increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion angles and decreased knee abduction, internal rotation angles and knee valgus during landing following the intervention. Further, the experimental group decreased their peak knee extension and abduction moments and vertical ground reaction force on landing post-intervention. International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire (IKDC) scores increased in the experimental group following training. The control group demonstrated no changes in any variable over the same time period. Conclusions Neuromuscular training with external focus of attention cueing improved landing biomechanics in patients after ACL reconstruction. Neuromuscular training programs beneficially mitigate second ACL injury risk factors and should be emphasized during and after traditional post-operative rehabilitation.

METHODS: Adolescent female elite football and handball players with no previous ACL injury participated in the present study. At baseline, players were tested during side-cutting manoeuvres performed in a 3-dimensional motion analysis laboratory with concomitant electromyography (EMG) measurements. Maximal isometric lower limb muscle strength was assessed by handheld dynamometry. Players were prospectively followed for 2 years after baseline testing, and all magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) verified ACL injuries were registered. The effect of 16 risk factor candidates on the relative risk (RR) of ACL injury was estimated using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety players (age 16.9 ± 1.2 years) were included in the analyses. Nine first-time ACL injuries (injury incidence 10.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4-18.6%)) were registered during the 2-year follow-up period. Four risk factor candidates were significantly associated with the risk of ACL injury: (1) hip flexion angle at initial contact (IC) [RR 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.92], (2) internal knee rotation angle at IC [RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.19], (3) semitendinosus EMG activity 50 ms prior to IC [RR: 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89], and (4) external hip rotator strength [RR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89]. CONCLUSION: Four distinct ACL injury risk factors related to the side-cutting manoeuvre were identified in a population of adolescent female elite football and team handball players with no previous ACL injury. As ACL injury typically occur during side-cutting, intervention programmes to modify these risk factors pose a promising strategy for ACL injury prevention in adolescent female elite football and team handball.

Methods Forty-nine male soccer players (mean age, 10.8 years) participated. The CMT program had three components (bench, side bench, and Nordic hamstrings) and was performed at least three times weekly for a year. Trunk flexion/extension muscle strength and the K/H ratio (determined by dividing knee separation distance by hip separation distance during drop-jump test and used as an index of lower limb valgus alignment) were measured, and the Y balance test (YBT) was performed before and after intervention. This study did not include the pure control group among the same team. To consider the effect of CMT on trunk muscle strength due to physical growth, we used the data of trunk muscle strength from the local cohort study previously conducted in our institution. One hundred participants who matched the age, height, body weight, and body mass index of the training group was designated as a control group. Results In the training group, the trunk flexion/extension strength significantly increased at 6 months ( p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and 12 months ( p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) compared to initial value. The K/H ratio at initial contact and maximum knee flexion phase significantly increased at 6 months ( p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively); however, it did not increase at 12 months ( p = 0.384 and p = 0.070, respectively) compared to the initial value. In the YBT, the maximized reach distance in each direction significantly increased after intervention on both the dominant and non-dominant sides, except in the posteromedial direction on the non-dominant foot. Compared to the control group, although there was no significant difference in trunk flexion/extension strength at baseline ( p = 0.141 and p = 0.390, respectively), the training group showed significantly higher trunk flexion/extension muscle strength at 12 months ( p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

In ACL injury risk studies, however, the uni-planar frontal plane external knee abduction moment is frequently studied in isolation. This study aimed to determine if the frontal plane knee moment (KM-Y) could classify all individuals crossing a risk threshold compared to those classified by a multi-planar non-sagittal knee moment vector (KM-YZ). Recreationally active females completed three sports tasks-drop vertical jumps, single-leg drop vertical jumps and planned sidesteps. Peak knee abduction moments and peak non-sagittal resultant knee moments were obtained for each task, and a risk threshold of the sample mean plus 1.6 standard deviations was used for classification. A sensitivity analysis of the threshold from 1-2 standard deviations was also conducted. KM-Y did not identify all participants who crossed the risk threshold as the non-sagittal moment identified unique individuals. This result was consistent across tasks and threshold sensitivities. Analysing the peak uni-planar knee abduction moment alone is therefore likely overly reductionist, as this study demonstrates that a KM-YZ threshold identifies 'at risk' individuals that a KM-Y threshold does not. Multi-planar moment metrics such as KM-YZ may help facilitate the development of screening protocols across multiple tasks."

Two independent reviewers assessed articles for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORs) criteria. Clinical outcomes of interest and key findings from biomechanical studies were summarized.Ten clinical studies (430 knotless repairs), including 4 cohort studies directly comparing knotless (N = 117) to knot-tying repairs (N = 192), were deemed eligible. Four biomechanical studies were also identified. Heterogeneity and the lack of randomized studies precluded data pooling and quantitative meta-analysis. Rates of redislocation ranged from 2.2% to 14.7% and 1.5% to 23.8% for knot-tying and knotless repair, respectively. Both knot-tying and knotless repair demonstrated excellent postoperative functional outcome, as assessed by visual analog scale, Constant-Murley, Rowe, and QuickDASH scores, with 80% to 94% of patients returning to sports participation. Biomechanical studies showed similar stiffness and load to failure between knot-tying and knotless repairs, with the most common mode of failure being retear at the suture-soft tissue interface.Current level II to IV clinical and biomechanical evidence supports knotless arthroscopic Bankart repair as an effective procedure with excellent functional outcomes and low rates of complication and reoperation.Level IV, systematic review of level II to IV studies."
https://openalex.org/W3157270346,CORR Insights®: Is Cam Morphology Found in Ancient and Medieval Populations in Addition to Modern Populations?,2021-05-05,2021,letter,"Where Are We Now? Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) results from abnormal contact between the proximal femur and the rim of the acetabulum. The most common morphology found in patients with symptomatic FAI is the cam morphology, which is characterized by an aspherical shape at the femoral-head neck junction. It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to known pathological processes such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) [2]. Studies have disagreed as to whether the cam morphology is a product of modern activities or whether it was present in historical or even ancient populations. Some studies have found evidence of cam morphology in ancient and older 20th century populations [8, 15], while another study examining the osteology from an indigenous North American population from approximately 1000 years ago did not find evidence of cam morphology, suggesting it may be a modern phenomenon [10]. Here, Musielak and colleagues [11] present a radiological study using osteology specimens examining the prevalence of cam morphology among two different ancient populations (Neolithic population from Iran and Medieval population from Poland) and one modern population (Australian aborigines) [11]. The authors found that cam morphology was present across all three populations at comparable levels of frequency (between 3% to 7%), and male specimens were more likely to have cam morphology relative to female specimens, which is supportive of prior work [8, 15] suggesting that cam morphology is not purely a modern phenomenon. The prevalence of cam morphology in modern populations appears to be more common than it is in the populations studied by Musielak et al. [11], with a range between 5% to 40% in asymptomatic volunteers with variation among the population studied, measurement technique (plain radiography, cross-sectional imaging), and sex, suggesting that modern lifestyles may exacerbate its development [6, 13]. Based on these discoveries, cam development is likely multifactorial and includes both biological/genetic contributions, as shown by the sex-based differences across a variety of different populations, and activity-related contributions, as illustrated by the different incidence rates across different historical populations compared to modern populations. Where Do We Need To Go? Recent studies [1, 3, 6, 12, 13] suggest a multifactorial origin to cam morphology, and further studies are needed to identify the relative contributions of these risk factors. One commonly associated risk factor is physical activity during skeletal immaturity. Cam morphology is thought to originate as an adaptive response to stresses across the capital femoral epiphysis during skeletal maturation, and participation in vigorous sporting activities prior to growth plate closure is thought to be one of the primary sources of cam morphology in modern populations [12]. For example, cam morphology is found more commonly after physeal closure and has a low prevalence in skeletally immature patients, suggesting that it develops around the time of growth plate closure [3]. Participation in youth athletics may contribute to these changes, for instance, an increased prevalence of anterosuperior flattening of the femoral head-neck junction developed over a mean 2-year period in adolescent soccer players close to skeletal maturity [1]. Additionally, increased development of cam morphology was seen in youth hockey players on MRI, most frequently developing at the time of final growth spurt for the capital femoral epiphysis between ages 13 to 16 [7]. While there appears to be an association of youth sports around the time of skeletal maturity with cam deformity, little work has been done to study ways to reduce the stresses across the hip by altering the intensity or the components of sports participation in an attempt to reduce proximal femoral remodeling. Additionally, the role of early surgical or nonsurgical intervention to change the developmental trajectory of these deformities remains unclear. Another risk factor is developmental pathology of the capital femoral epiphyseal region, such as clinical or subclinical SCFE. Subtle SCFE deformities have been observed in the setting of cam FAI, suggesting that this may also contribute to the development of cam morphology seen at skeletal maturity [2]. Additionally, differences in bony morphology of the epiphyseal tubercle relative to the metaphyseal fossa may affect the relative stability of the growth plate during development, and compensatory mechanisms such as increased epiphy-seal peripheral cupping may ultimately contribute to the development of cam morphology [9]. Another important area of study is the relative contribution of these deformities to future osteoarthritis development. Cam morphology is commonly found in older patients who participated in athletic activities during their lifetime, but this is not necessarily associated with osteoarthritis development, suggesting that further knowledge about the role of cam morphology in osteoarthritis progression is needed to identify the subset of patients who will develop symptomatic osteoarthritis [7]. While biomechanical forces across the growth plate appear to contribute to cam morphologies, they don’t explain their development in all situations. This leaves open the possibility of a biological contribution or genetic differences in structural morphology of the hip as a contribution to cam development and progression to osteoarthritis [10], which future studies ought to investigate. How Do We Get There? Large, cross-sectional, prospective, population-based studies have a strong precedent in osteoarthritis research and would be the most influential in defining the origin and natural history of cam morphology in modern populations [5]. Smaller studies have already provided some insight into the origins of cam development, but more research is needed across a diverse range of ages, sexes, geographical distributions, and activity demands including both sedentary patients to competitive athletes. Radiological imaging of the capital femoral epiphysis in both non-sports participants and sports participants from the time of skeletal immaturity until after skeletal maturity will provide insight into the process of cam development and its association with athletic activities or pathological processes of the growth plate. Additionally, these studies may shed light on the populations of patients who may benefit from early surgical or nonsurgical interventions. For instance, loss of hip internal rotation secondary to cam morphology was associated with increased risk of early radiological degenerative changes in adolescent patients [14]. Further insight into the biological development of cam morphology and the progression of osteoarthritis in the setting of FAI would also be beneficial to understanding the underlying pathological mechanisms. For instance, in vivo models that recapitulate cam morphology development provide a controlled setting to understand the relative contributions of biological factors and biomechanical factors that lead to cam development and intra-articular injury [16]. Additionally, human retrieval studies using biological tissues such as peripheral blood, synovial tissue, and cartilage tissue in affected patients may provide further insights into the development of FAI [4] and osteoarthritis progression."

This digital transformation not only affects the way products are manufactured but also creates new opportunities for the design of products, processes, services, and systems. Unlike traditional design practices based on system-centric concepts, design for these new opportunities requires a holistic view of the human (stakeholder), artefact (product), and process (realization) dimensions of the design problem. In this paper we envision a “human-cyber-physical view of the systems realization ecosystem,” termed “Design Engineering 4.0 (DE4.0),” to reconceptualize how cyber and physical technologies can be seamlessly integrated to identify and fulfil customer needs and garner the benefits of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we review the evolution of Engineering Design in response to advances in several strategic areas including smart and connected products, end-to-end digital integration, customization and personalization, data-driven design, digital twins and intelligent design automation, extended supply chains and agile collaboration networks, open innovation, co-creation and crowdsourcing, product servitization and anything-as-a-service, and platformization for the sharing economy. We postulate that DE 4.0 will account for drivers such as Internet of Things, Internet of People, Internet of Services, and Internet of Commerce to deliver on the promise of Industry 4.0 effectively and efficiently. Further, we identify key issues to be addressed in DE 4.0 and engage the design research community on the challenges that the future holds."

Unlike in previous research, we aimed in this study to quantify the effects of this “external” biofeedback on selected performance and technique variables for the boxing jab among both novices and experts. The technical setup included two inertial measurement units linked wirelessly to a video game system with audio output. The units were configured to provide auditory external biofeedback, based on the peak acceleration of the bag (i.e., biofeedback with an external attentional focus). Sixteen participants (8 novices and 8 experts) performed boxing jabs against the bag in blocked phases of biofeedback. When compared to baseline, the acute effects of externally focused biofeedback on peak bag acceleration were possibly positive in both retention phases for novices (d = 0.29; d = 0.41) and likely positive for experts (d = 0.41; d = 0.30), respectively. The experts’ performance improvements were accompanied by substantive increases in trunk rotation, though this was not true for the novices. Thus, technique improvements can be promoted indirectly via externally focused biofeedback, but only when these actions are within the performers’ motor repertoire. Overall, biofeedback via inertial sensors appears to be a potent technique for modifying human movement patterns in both experts and novices. This low-cost technology could be used to support training across sports, rehabilitation and human-computer interactions."

The purpose of this study was to determine if strength and functional outcomes differ between individuals who injured their preferred or nonpreferred jumping limb and to determine if these same outcomes differ between individuals who injured their preferred or nonpreferred limb used to kick a ball. A secondary purpose was to determine the association of quadriceps strength and single-leg forward hop performance with patient self-reported function. Forty individuals with ACL reconstruction (age = 20.0 ± 4.6 years, height = 174.2 ± 12.7 cm, mass = 71.2 ± 12.7 kg, time since surgery = 5.3 ± 0.8 months) were included in the study. Primary outcome measures included, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) scores, quadriceps limb symmetry index (LSI) values, and single-leg forward hop LSI values. Limb preference was defined two ways, kicking a ball and performing a unilateral jump. There were no significant differences between groups based on injury to the preferred limb to kick a ball for any of the outcome variables. Individuals who injured their nonpreferred jumping limb demonstrated significantly (p = 0.05, d = 0.77) lower single-leg forward hop LSI values (81.1% ± 19.5%) compared to individuals who injured their preferred jumping limb (94.1% ± 12.6%), but demonstrated no differences in IKDC scores or quadriceps LSI values. Quadriceps LSI and single-leg forward hop LSI explained 73% of the variance in IKDC scores, but quadriceps LSI had the strongest association (r = 0.790). These findings suggests that limb preference influences single forward hop LSI values and should be considered following ACL reconstruction."

At that time, at the beginning of 2018, your editor was able to reflect on the journey of our professional association – the International Society for Comparative Physical Education and Sport (ISCPES). It started with a small, cohesive, and optimistic group of physical education scholars from Europe and North America interested in working across boundaries and exploring new international horizons. The group that met in Borovets in 2017 on the eve of the society’s fortieth anniversary, represented a wider range of origins. They were also more circumspect, tempered by their experience in what had become, four decades later, a very much more complex competitive and fragmented professional environment. Such a comparison seems almost to have reflected a common journey, from the hope and optimism of youth to entry into the challenges and responsibilities of mid adulthood. Yet from the perspective of contemporary history, these last four decades seem generally to be viewed as having been a time of unbroken human progress. Certainly, this is a defensible view when we use technological and economic progress as the criterion. The nation of Indonesia provides an excellent example of progress by these measures."
https://openalex.org/W3160085924,Anterior cruciate ligament injury mechanisms through a neurocognition lens: implications for injury screening,2021-05-01,2021,review,"Athletes in team sports have to quickly visually perceive actions of opponents and teammates while executing their own movements. These continuous actions are performed under time pressure and may contribute to a non-contact ACL injury. However, ACL injury screening and prevention programmes are primarily based on standardised movements in a predictable environment. The sports environment provides much greater cognitive demand because athletes must attend their attention to numerous external stimuli and inhibit impulsive actions. Any deficit or delay in attentional processing may contribute to an inability to correct potential errors in complex coordination, resulting in knee positions that increase the ACL injury risk. In this viewpoint, we advocate that ACL injury screening should include the sports specific neurocognitive demands."

Our hypothesis was that the addition of LET would decrease the risk of secondary meniscal injury and the presence of residual high-grade PS at follow-up.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.A retrospective analysis performed at 3 sports medicine centers identified 266 study patients; all had a high-grade PS (grade 2 or 3) preoperatively and underwent isolated ACLR with or without LET. Four different ACLR techniques were used: single-strand quadrupled semitendinosus (ST4) ACLR without LET (ST4 group; n = 55), ST4 with anatomic LET (ST4+LET group; n = 77), bone-patellar tendon and modified Lemaire LET (BTB+LET group; n = 43), and quadriceps tendon and modified Lemaire LET (QT+LET group; n = 91). At follow-up, we evaluated for the presence of high-grade (grade ≥2) PS. Preoperative meniscal tears and their treatment were recorded.Overall, 185 (69.5%) patients had at least 1 meniscal tear at index surgery. The mean follow-up period was 44.3 months; 47 (17.7%) patients had a new meniscal tear and 64 (24%) patients had a high-grade PS at follow-up. Compared with meniscal repair, significant predictors for high-grade PS at follow-up were meniscectomy (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65 [95% CI, 1.19-5.63]; P = .02) and nonrepair of preoperative meniscal tear (OR = 3.26 [95% CI, 1.27-9.43]; P = .007). The appearance of a new symptomatic meniscal tear was the strongest significant predictor of high-grade PS at follow-up (OR = 4.31 [95% CI, 2.31-8.06]; P < .001). No significant correlation was observed between the addition of LET and the presence of high-grade PS at follow-up.In the current study, 1 in 4 patients with high-grade PS before ACLR with or without LET was at risk of residual rotatory knee laxity at mean 44-month follow-up, regardless of the technique used. Repairing a pre-existing meniscal lesion was more effective than performing LET to decrease the presence of a high-grade PS at follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3157827388,Posterior oblique ligament of the knee: state of the art,2021-05-01,2021,review,"The posterior oblique ligament (POL) is the predominant ligamentous structure on the posterior medial corner of the knee joint. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, biomechanics, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of POL injuries will aid orthopaedic surgeons in the management of these injuries.The resulting rotational instability, in addition to valgus laxity, may not be tolerated by athletes participating in pivoting sports. The most common mechanism of injury - accounting for 72% of cases - is related to sports activity, particularly football, basketball and skiing. Moreover, three different injury patterns have been reported: those associated with injury to the capsular arm of the semimembranosus (SM), those involving a complete peripheral meniscal detachment and those involving disruption of the SM and peripheral meniscal detachment.The hallmark of an injury related to POL lesions is the presence of anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI), which is defined as 'external rotation with anterior subluxation of the medial tibial plateau relative to the distal femur'.In acute settings, POL lesions can be easily identified using coronal and axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and POL appear as separate structures. However, MRI is not sensitive in chronic cases.Surgical treatment of the medial side leads to satisfactory clinical results in a multi-ligamentous reconstruction scenario, but it is known to be associated with secondary stiffness.In young patients with high functional demands, return to sports is allowed no earlier than 9-12 months after they have undergone a thorough rehabilitation programme.

Method: A total of 390 soccer players age (U13). From 14 Algerian soccer clubs were enrolled and subjected to standard anthropometric, fitness (speed 20m, CMJ, skills-related performance testing. The testing battery will be described as will the process for converting test data into standardized scores. Data will be presented to show the strengths and weaknesses of some players. Result: After analysing the results based on the standard criteria for the proposed tests as well as the overall performance variable. And the ability of each youth to be selected according to their potential, and therefore it was stressed that the proposed criteria, which are scientific support for the field observation, should be emphasized to facilitate this process for Algerian soccer players. The findings from this study indicate that marked improvements and parameters associated with physical maturity such as height, weight, speed, VO2max, or chronological age are important to determine the success of a soccer player. At older ages, other factors such as agility seem to be more important. Nevertheless, players born in the 1st semester of the year are also more frequent in the older teams. These findings should be taken into account by trainers and coaches in order to avoid biasing their selection choices."

Methods: Studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 01/1995 to 09/2020. Included studies contained detailed rehabilitation protocols with physiologic rationale for AC joint injuries. Biomechanical studies, technique articles, radiographic studies, systematic reviews, case studies, editorials, and studies that compared nonoperative versus operative treatment without focus on rehabilitation were excluded. Following identification of the literature, an updated treatment algorithm was created. Results: The search strategy yielded 1742 studies, of which 1654 studies were excluded based on title, 60 on the abstract, and 25 on the full manuscript. One study was manually identified using article reference lists, yielding four publications presenting detailed rehabilitation protocols based on physiologic rationale. No randomized controlled trials or comparative studies were identified or cited as a basis for these rehabilitation protocols. Conclusion: Few detailed rehabilitation protocols in patients with AC joint injuries have been published. These protocols are limited by their standardization, arbitrary timelines, and provide minimal assessment of individual patient characteristics. The quality of patient care can be improved with more practical guidelines that are goal-oriented and allow for critical thinking among clinicians to address individual patient needs. Three common barriers preventing successful rehabilitation were identified and addressed: Pain, Apprehension, and (anterior chest wall) Stiffness to regain Scapular control, effectively termed ""PASS"" for AC joint rehabilitation. Clinical Relevance: Rehabilitation protocols for AC joint injuries should be less formulaic and instead allow for critical thinking and effective communication among clinicians and therapists to address individual patient needs.

The fat pad is a structure with mounting evidence supporting its dynamic involvement in many pathological states in the anterior knee. There are three peripatellar fat pads that occupy much of the extra-synovial space of the knee. This review explores the anatomy, innervation, vasculature, function, imaging, and pathology of these fat pads. Fat pad pathology is likely underestimated given the limited literature on such disease in the pediatric population. In particular, the prefemoral fat pad is the least described of the fat pads with only a few reports detailing chronic pathological processes. To highlight the relevance of the fat pad, particularly in the pediatric population, we describe an atypical case of a self-limiting acute prefemoral fat pad impingement due to a hyperextension injury in a young athlete."

The Case of Combative Bovids,2021-05-01,2021,article,"Forceful headbutting clashes occur every year during the rut for most bovids. Bighorn sheep (Ovis aries) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) show extreme examples of this behavior, exerting head-to-head forces of over 3000 N. Their large horns are commonly thought to protect them from these impacts, to the extent of inspiring football equipment. However, whether their horns or thick skull successfully prevent brain trauma has not been investigated experimentally until now. The aim of our research is to study anatomical adaptations of animals with extreme behaviors in order to provide solutions to human problems. A better understanding of brain injury, or the prevention thereof in these animals, will provide insight for the reduction of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans at a time where clinical translation of experimental therapies is limited. In a preliminary study, we found early signs of chronic brain injury in a male muskox using immunohistochemistry staining for abnormally phosphorylated tau and high-resolution MRI. Applying the same techniques to bighorn sheep is complicated, as their tau expression is not well understood. Despite the possibility of brain trauma, the capacity to survive such forceful impacts and continue to thrive is not negligible. Thus, alongside the brain, we simultaneously investigated anatomical properties of the skull of both species, using an ontogenetic series of skulls and skull CT scans, respectively. The skulls of six muskoxen and six bighorn sheep were bisected to describe the braincase in detail for the first time. The differences between juveniles, adults, males, and females were especially important because of the sexually dimorphic nature of headbutting behavior. In muskoxen for example, the male skull is approximately 300% larger than that of the female. Although the large pneumatized sinuses of species such as the bighorn sheep have been suspected to contribute to force mitigation, they may simply be a scaffolding supporting the rapid growth of large horns. Furthermore, bighorn sheep horn cores are proven to have similar biomechanical properties to that of regular cortical bone. These findings indicate that the horns and sinuses may not be the main means of protection and we instead hypothesize that the brain's position within the braincase, its connection to meninges, and the rough inner-surface of the cranium are what allow these animals to survive such extreme forces. Anatomical descriptions will serve to increase our knowledge of bovid inner-cranial anatomy all while aiming to determine which anatomical features are most likely to protect bovid brains, which in turn could be translated to humans as a preventive strategy for TBI."

Most of the treatment approaches are based on plain X- rays, and do not give us any information on how to treat these fractures. In the search for solutions with greater precision in diagnosis, in reducing the joint surface of the fracture, and envolving minimally-invasive techniques, we found arthroscopy as the main tool for these patients. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of the biomechanics of the different types of fracture associated with ligamentous lesions should facilitate the right decision regarding the treatment. The present paper aims at providing a management-oriented concept to diagnose and treat ligamentous lesions associated with intra-articular DRFs based on a arthroscopy-assisted procedure, and showing the objective and patient-reported outcomes and a new classification. The objective and patient-reported outcomes were: the mean range of motion (ROM) was of 94.80% on the non-affected side; the mean score on the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) was of 3.6 (range: 1 to 12). The score on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was of 1.66 (range: 1 to 3). Complications were observed in 2 (13.33%) patients: extensor tendon synovitis in 1 patient, and a limitation (stiffness) in ROM in 1 patient, both treated with wrist arthroscopy release. The mean time until the return to work was of 6.4 weeks. In patients with unstable intra-articular DRFs associated with ligamentous lesions, the fixation of specific osseous-ligamentous fragments and ligamentous repair/reconstruction by wrist arthroscopy prove to be a safe and reliable treatment. The clinical and functional results predict that the patients can return to work more quickly."

https://openalex.org/W4230925577,Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Athletes: A Review,2021-04-30,2021,review,"Soccer is becoming an increasingly popular sport amongst women. Common movements during play, such as jumping and cutting, require rapid acceleration and deceleration of multiple lower-limb joints. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which contributes to stabilization of the knee, is often injured during these events. ACL injury typically requires costly surgery, extended time away from sports, and jeopardizes long-term joint health. Due to sex-specific factors such as menstruation and anatomical disadvantages, women are more susceptible to tearing their ACL. Injury often occurs in non-contact scenarios during rapid acceleration or deceleration movements. Research has examined these movements and established several kinematic and kinetic mechanisms as well as muscle activation patterns that frequently occur at the time of injury, however results tend to vary based on population. This article summarizes recent and relevant literature of ACL injury mechanisms and highlights the lack of specific research in the high-risk female soccer athlete population. Due to inconclusive risk factors, injury prevention programs within this population have been inconsistent. ACL injury risk for female soccer athletes should be closer examined so that more specific injury risks can be established, and effective protective measures can be taken. Raised awareness of this need may capture attention in the research and medical communities and potentially stimulate the development of strategies that limit future ACL injury and thus the challenges it brings to the high-risk female soccer athlete."

Studies are scarce on the biomechanical effects of the commonly utilized BF positions.This study evaluated the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the trunk muscles in response to three BF positions commonly utilized by mothers globally.20 non-pregnant nulliparous females participated in this experimental study. EMG activities from erector spinae (ES) and external oblique (EO) muscles were recorded bilaterally in three BF conditions: cradle (C1); cross-cradle (C2); football (FB). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of one-way analysis of variance with alpha level set at 0.05.The activity levels of right EO and ES muscles significantly increased during the C2 hold, while the left EO and ES muscles revealed significantly higher EMG levels in the C1 trial. Asymmetrical activity between the right and the left parts of the EO muscle was significantly higher during the C2 hold.These findings suggest that compared to C2 and C1 holds, FB hold may be more biomechanically efficient relative to its decreased muscular demands. The physical stresses associated with BF may be higher with the adoption of C2 and C1 holds, especially for prolonged periods."
https://openalex.org/W3161416342,Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Female Soccer Athletes: A Review,2021-04-30,2021,review,"Soccer is becoming an increasingly popular sport amongst women. Common movements during play, such as jumping and cutting, require rapid acceleration and deceleration of multiple lower-limb joints. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which contributes to stabilization of the knee, is often injured during these events. ACL injury typically requires costly surgery, extended time away from sports, and jeopardizes long-term joint health. Due to sex-specific factors such as menstruation and anatomical disadvantages, women are more susceptible to tearing their ACL. Injury often occurs in non-contact scenarios during rapid acceleration or deceleration movements. Research has examined these movements and established several kinematic and kinetic mechanisms as well as muscle activation patterns that frequently occur at the time of injury, however results tend to vary based on population. This article summarizes recent and relevant literature of ACL injury mechanisms and highlights the lack of specific research in the high-risk female soccer athlete population. Due to inconclusive risk factors, injury prevention programs within this population have been inconsistent. ACL injury risk for female soccer athletes should be closer examined so that more specific injury risks can be established, and effective protective measures can be taken. Raised awareness of this need may capture attention in the research and medical communities and potentially stimulate the development of strategies that limit future ACL injury and thus the challenges it brings to the high-risk female soccer athlete."

This study aimed to investigate hip ABD and AD strength and their relation in balance and ankle dorsiflexion mobility in young elite female basketball players. Observational study in a total of 60 trainee-level elite female basketball players (13–17 years old) were included. Hip ABD and AD isometric strength values were collected. The correlation study showed that hip ABD strength had a low-moderate correlation with balance and ankle mobility in the homolateral and contralateral leg, while there was a low-moderate correlation between hip AD strength and balance and ankle mobility only in the homolateral leg. On the other hand, the ABD-AD ratio was not found to correlate with balance or mobility scores, nor the degree of muscle imbalance between legs. Hip ABD and AD strength affects balance and ankle mobility in trainee level female basketball players. These findings should thus be taken into consideration when designing strategies aimed at reducing the risk of limb injury, which has a high prevalence in women's basketball."
https://openalex.org/W3158735721,ACL injury prevention: Where have we come from and where are we going?,2021-04-29,2021,review,"Abstract Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common and severe knee injuries across sports. As such, ACL injury prevention has been a focus of research and sports medicine practice for the past three‐plus decades. Examining the current research and identifying both clinical strategies and research gaps, the aim of this review is to empower clinicians and researchers with knowledge of where the ACL injury prevention literature is currently and where it is going in the future. This paper examines the mechanism of ACL injury prevention, screening, implementation, compliance, adherence, coronavirus, and areas of future research. Clinical significance: The time lag between research and practical implementation in general healthcare settings can be as long as 17 years; however, athletes playing sports today are unable to wait that long. With effective programs already established, implementation and adherence to these programs is essential. Strategies such as coaching education, increasing awareness of free programs, identifying barriers, and overcoming implementation obstacles through creative collaboration are just a few ways that could help improve both ACL injury prevention implementation and adherence."

Although 3D motion capture is the gold standard for the biomechanical evaluation of high-speed multidirectional movements, 2D video analysis is a growing-interest alternative because of its higher cost-effectiveness and interpretability. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible association between a 2D evaluation of a 90° change of direction (COD) and the KAM measured with gold standard 3D motion analysis.Thirty-four competitive football (soccer) players (age 22.8 ± 4.1, 18 male and 16 females) were enrolled. Each athlete performed a series of pre-planned 90° COD at the maximum speed possible in a laboratory equipped with artificial turf. 3D motion analysis was recorded using 10 stereophotogrammetric cameras, a force platform, and three high-speed cameras. The 2D evaluation was performed through a scoring system based on the video analysis of frontal and sagittal plane joint kinematics. Five scoring criteria were adopted: limb stability (LS), pelvis stability (PS), trunk stability (TS), shock absorption (SA), and movement strategy (MS). For each criterion, a sub-score of 0/2 (non-adequate), 1/2 (partially adequate), or 2/2 (adequate) was attributed to the movement, based on objective measurements. The intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated for each criterion and the total score. The Knee Abduction Moment (KAM) was extracted from the 3D motion analysis and grouped according to the results of the 2D evaluation.Excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC > 0.88) and good-to-excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.68-0.92) were found. Significantly higher KAM was found for athletes obtaining a 0/2 score compared to those obtaining a 2/2 score in all the sub-criteria and the total score (20-47% higher, p < 0.05). The total score and the LS score showed the best discriminative power between the three groups.The 2D video-analysis scoring system here described was a simple and effective tool to discriminate athletes with high and low KAM in the assessment of a 90° COD and could be a potential method to identify athletes at high risk of non-contact ACL injury.IV."
https://openalex.org/W3157091532,Sex differences in the consumption of over-the-counter analgesics among amateur volleyball players,2021-04-29,2021,article,"Abstract Background Compared with the normal adult population, athletes of several sport disciplines, such as endurance sports, ball sports, cycling and swimming, have higher use of over-the-counter analgesics (OTC analgesics). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of OTC analgesic use in volleyball players as a typical competitive sport discipline. One particular focus was placed on the analysis whether the athletes’ use of OTC analgesics was influenced by their performance motivation. Methods A cross-sectional survey among amateur volleyball players was carried out using a web-based sports questionnaire. The study included athletes of both sexes, 18 years and older, currently playing in a German volleyball league. The athletes’ sport-related complaints were evaluated regarding the use of OTC analgesics. The use of OTC analgesics by athletes was compared with their performance motivation, based on the „Achievement Motives Scale - Sport” (AMS-Sport) questionnaire. Results The analysis of 114 completed questionnaires of amateur athletes revealed that the use of OTC analgesics was sex dependent, with a higher prevalence of use in female players (60%) versus male players (38%). The main reasons for consumption of OTC analgesics were pain in the head, knee and shoulder. The most frequently taken drug was ibuprofen, most often taken at competitions and over a period of 4 years (median). The analysis of the AMS-Sport questionnaire revealed that a logistic regression model for estimating the probability of drug use can be explained by the factors hope of success and years of playing practise in female players but not male players. In females, an increase in the factor hope of success resulted in a lower probability of OTC analgesic use, while an increase in years of playing practise resulted in a higher probability of use. Conclusion The average duration that volleyball players in this study took OTC analgesics was higher than that of the German population, and OTC analgesic use was more prevalent in female than male volleyball players. Thus, to reduce the prevalence of OTC analgesic use, educational programs should be implemented in sports teams; and, to reduce direct and indirect social pressure, sports teams should also receive sex-specific psychological support."

However, the transferability to real-world scenarios cannot be granted due to limitations on data and evaluation methods. On the example of football shot and pass detection against a null class we explore the influence of those factors for real-world event classification in field sports. For this purpose we compare the performance of an established Support Vector Machine (SVM) for laboratory settings from literature to the performance in three evaluation scenarios gradually evolving from laboratory settings to real-world scenarios. In addition, three different types of neural networks, namely a convolutional neural net (CNN), a long short term memory net (LSTM) and a convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) are compared. Results indicate that the SVM is not able to reliably solve the investigated three-class problem. In contrast, all deep learning models reach high classification scores showing the general feasibility of event detection in real-world sports scenarios using deep learning. The maximum performance with a weighted f1-score of 0.93 was reported by the CNN. The study provides valuable insights for sports assessment under practically relevant conditions. In particular, it shows that (1) the discriminative power of established features needs to be reevaluated when real-world conditions are assessed, (2) the selection of an appropriate dataset and evaluation method are both required to evaluate real-world applicability and (3) deep learning-based methods yield promising results for real-world HAR in sports despite high variations in the execution of activities."

https://openalex.org/W3159896538,Effectiveness of PitchSafe on Knowledge and Attitude of Baseball-Related Concussion,2021-04-28,2021,article,"Background Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), specifically concussions, affect many athletes and have dangerous immediate and long-term sequelae. Lack of awareness surrounding concussion impedes prevention, identification, and treatment. This study aims to assess parental knowledge and attitudes regarding concussions in youth baseball before and after administering an educational intervention called PitchSafe. PitchSafe is a short video that contains examples of baseball-related head injuries such as collisions, falls, and direct hits by baseballs; the signs and symptoms of a concussion; testimony from a former baseball player who sustained a TBI playing baseball; and a brochure detailing the potential signs, symptoms, and treatment plans associated with concussions. Methodology The Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitudes Survey (RoCKAS) was used to assess three indices of parental understanding of concussion: Concussion Knowledge Index (CKI), Concussion Attitudes Index (CAI), and signs and symptoms of concussions (SS). The RoCKAS was administered at baseline and after the PitchSafe tool was administered. Parents were re-assessed one year following the initial distribution of survey materials utilizing the long-term follow-up (LTFU) RoCKAS. A paired sample t-test was conducted to compare the baseline, post-intervention (PI), and LTFU CKI, CAI, and SS among participants. Results The mean scores for CKI were 68% ± 12%, 76% ± 4%, and 76% ± 5% for baseline, PI, and LTFU, respectively. The mean scores for SS were 46% ± 20%, 62% ± 14%, and 64% ± 16% for baseline, PI, and LTFU, respectively. The mean scores for CAI were 87% ± 6%, 91% ± 5%, and 92% ± 4% for baseline, PI, and LTFU, respectively. Conclusions PitchSafe increased youth baseball parents’ long-term knowledge of concussions, ability to identify signs and symptoms of concussions, and may promote safer attitudes toward concussions. These findings support more widespread use of educational tools through social media and in clinical settings."

We investigated the site of osteochondritis dissecans lesions and the patellofemoral joint anatomy of femoral trochlear osteochondritis dissecans in 15 knees, and assessed the clinical outcomes of the surgical treatments. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 15 knees in 14 patients who underwent surgery. The mean age was 13.2 ± 1.0 years at the time of surgery. All patients played athletic sports and experienced no traumatic events. We determined the site of osteochondritis dissecans lesions using the modified Cahill and Berg classification on magnetic resonance imaging scans. We also evaluated the patellofemoral structures with sulcus angle, facet ratio, patellar tilt, patellar height, and tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance. Results: We performed osteochondral autograft transplantation surgery in nine knees, internal fixation in four knees, and drilling in two knees. The mean follow-up period was 34.5 ± 14.0 months, and the period of return to sports was 6.1 ± 1 months. At the final follow-up, the mean Tegner activity scale was 7.2 ± 1.4 (preoperative score was 7.7 ± 1.0), and the Lysholm knee score was 98.5 (range, 89-100). The area of most preponderance was in the medial portion of the lateral femoral condyle in the frontal view, and in the segment superior two-thirds of the anterior region in the lateral view. There were no anatomical abnormalities in the patellofemoral structures. Conclusions: Femoral trochlear osteochondritis dissecans lesions occurred in virtually identical sites, and there were no anatomical abnormalities. This disease seemed to be related to the repetitive and persistent loading from the patella at slight knee flexion. In almost all cases, satisfactory postoperative results were obtained for osteochondritis dissecans regardless of the stage or surgical method."
https://openalex.org/W3157300545,Role of magnetic resonance imaging in ankle sprains,2021-04-27,2021,article,"Background and objective: Musculoskeletal injuries frequently occur in the ankle in both the athletic and general population. Ankle sprains are among the most frequent types of ankle injuries, which are conventionally diagnosed through clinical examinations. However, magnetic resonance imaging can provide a more precise diagnosis, leading to better injury management and prevention of consequent chronic complications. The present study aimed to examine the significance of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting and assessing changes that occur in ligaments and soft tissues in patients with ankle sprains. Methods: In a prospective study, 50 patients with ankle sprain referred to Rizgary and Erbil Teaching hospitals in Erbil city, Iraqi Kurdistan Region, from March 2018 to April 2019, were included in the study. They underwent clinical evaluation and MRI (GE general electric 1.5 Tesla). Two expert radiologists analyzed the magnetic resonance imaging images, and the results were compared. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 23 through descriptive statistics. Results: Most patients (64%) belonged to the age groups of 30-49 years old. Most of them (64%) were males. Most events of ankle sprain (66%) were because of sports and accidents. The clinical evaluation proved 82% of the ankle sprains. Regarding the laterality of the lesions, 60% were spotted in the right ankles and 40% in the left. According to magnetic resonance imaging results, both radiologists diagnosed that the ankle sprains included bone lesions, ligament injury, tendon injury, and effusion. There was an agreement of ≥ 96% between the two radiologists in this regard. The two radiologists were not significantly different in terms of diagnosing the ligament side. As reported by the radiologists based on the magnetic resonance imaging images, the anterior, lateral, and medial tendons were normal in most cases. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging is a vitally important tool that can be utilized reliably and accurately to diagnose and evaluate changes in ligaments and soft tissues in patients with ankle sprains.

In this study, the portable system was used on 65 healthy rugby players throughout a season to determine whether SSVEP are a reliable electrophysiological biomarker for concussion. Preceding the competition season, all players underwent a baseline SSVEP assessment. During the season, players were re-tested within 72 h of a match for either test-retest reliability or post-injury assessment. In the case of a medically diagnosed concussion, players were reassessed again once deemed recovered by a physician. The SSVEP system consisted of a smartphone housed in a VR-frame delivering a 15 Hz flicker stimulus, while a wireless EEG headset recorded occipital activity. Players were instructed to stare at the screen's fixation point while remaining seated and quiet. Electrodes were arranged according to the 10-20 EEG-positioning nomenclature, with O1-O2 being the recording channels while P1-P2 the references and bias, respectively. All EEG data was processed using a Butterworth bandpass filter, Fourier transformation, and normalization to convert data for frequency analysis. Players SSVEP responses were quantified into a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with 15 Hz being the desired signal, and summarized into respective study groups for comparison. Concussed players were seen to have a significantly lower SNR compared to their baseline; however, post-recovery, their SNR was not significantly different from the baseline. Test-retest indicated high device reliability for the portable system. An improved portable SSVEP system was also validated against an established EEG amplifier to ensure the investigative design is capable of obtaining research quality EEG measurements. This is the first study to identify differences in SSVEP responses in amateur athletes following a concussion and indicates the potential for SSVEP as an aid in concussion assessment and management."

The constrained action hypothesis (CAH) purports that the FOA inhibits sports performance whereas no ecologically valid evidence has been found in previous studies. The purpose of this research is to explore the effect of video feedback on knee biomechanics in a volleyball spike jump including landing and take-off phases. The video feedback was performed in a natural way. Fourteen volleyball male players were recruited in this study. A paired t-test was used to detect the effect of the feedback; meanwhile, statistical parameter mapping (SPM) statistics were used for the continuum differences during movement. After biofeedback, the initial contact flexion angle of the knee (t = 2.179, p = 0.049), the maximal flexion angle of the knee (t = 3.242, p = 0.006) and the maximal internal rotation angular velocity of the knee (t = 5.209, p = 0.003) increased significantly; the maximal extension moment of the knee (t = 3.962, p &lt; 0.001) and the maximal flexion moment of the knee (t = −3.711, p = 0.002) significantly decreased; the maximal abduction moment significantly decreased (t = 3.069, p = 0.037) but the maximal internal rotation moment significantly increased (t = 2.813, p = 0.018); the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) (t = 7.618, p &lt; 0.001) and the average loading rate to the first peak (t = 4.205, p = 0.004) significantly decreased; the other peaks of the vGRF were not found to have differences; a larger knee flexion was found during the phase from 31.17 to 73.19% (t = 2.611, p = 0.012); a larger adduction angular velocity was found during the phase from 49.07 to 62.46% (t = 3.148, p = 0.004); a smaller external rotational angular velocity was found during the phase from 45.85 to 49.96% (t = 5.011 p = 0.017); there was an increased flexion moment of the knee during the phase from 19.72 to 21.38% (t = 0.029, p = 0.029) and an external moment of the knee during the phase from 85.55 to 95.06% (t = 4.214, p &lt; 0.001); the vGRF significantly decreased during the phase from 3.13 to 5.94% (t = 4.096, p = 0.014) and 19.83–21.97% (t = 4.096, p = 0.024) but significantly increased in the phase of 91.43–100% (t = 4.096, p &lt; 0.001). The impulse of the vGRF and knee power were not found to be different compared with before biofeedback. Therefore, our study suggests video feedback in a natural practice has the potential to improve knee movement whilst not altering the performance in a volleyball spike jump. This indicates that the CAH theory is possibly not suitable in a real competition. Due to the complexity of human movements and the limitations of this study, muscle activities must be considered in the future."

According to pretest value based on functional movement screening, 38 participants were divided into a high-risk group (HG) and a low-risk group (LG) with 22 and 16 people in each group. Two groups of athletes took part in an 8-week INT program consisting of four 90-min sessions each week. The asymmetries in movement, physical fitness, and special abilities were tested before and after the intervention. Independent sample <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""> <mi>t</mi> </math> -test was used for the statistical analysis. Results. This research found indicated that 8 weeks of INT influenced FMS scores in both groups (HG and LG).

Compared to the pretest, most of the physical fitness parameters improved significantly in the HG and LG groups except strength index, and special abilities of the HG and LG group women badminton athletes showed a substantial increase. Conclusion. Integrated neuromuscular training can effectively improve the asymmetry of female badminton athletes’ limbs, prevent sports injury, and improve the athlete’s performance ability. However, athletes in different risk groups have certain differences in the degree of improvement in their motor skills."
https://openalex.org/W3152631503,Evaluation of outcome reporting trends for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome- a systematic review,2021-04-23,2021,review,"Abstract Purpose The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the trends in the literature regarding surgical treatment for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) and to present which patient-reported outcome-measures (PROMs) and surgical approaches are included. Methods This systematic review was conducted with the PRISMA guidelines. The literature search was performed on PubMed and Embase, covering studies from 1999 to 2020. Inclusion criteria were clinical studies with surgical treatment for FAIS, the use of PROMs as evaluation tool and studies in English. Exclusion criteria were studies with patients &lt; 18 years, cohorts with &lt; 8 patients, studies with primarily purpose to evaluate other diagnoses than FAIS and studies with radiographs as only outcomes without using PROMs. Data extracted were author, year, surgical intervention, type of study, level of evidence, demographics of included patients, and PROMs. Results The initial search yielded 2,559 studies, of which 196 were included. There was an increase of 2,043% in the number of studies from the first to the last five years (2004–2008)—(2016–2020). There were 135 (69%) retrospective, 55 (28%) prospective and 6 (3%) Randomized Controlled Trials. Level of evidence ranged from I-IV where Level III was most common (44%). More than half of the studies (58%) originated from USA. Arthroscopic surgery was the most common surgical treatment (85%). Mean follow-up was 27.0 months (± 17 SD), (range 1.5–120 months). Between 1–10 PROMs were included, and the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) was most commonly used (61%). Conclusion There has been a continuous increase in the number of published studies regarding FAIS with the majority evaluating arthroscopic surgery. The mHHS remains being the most commonly used PROM."
https://openalex.org/W3154792453,The Hammer and the Nail: Biomechanics of Striking and Struck Canadian University Football Players,2021-04-23,2021,article,"This study sought to evaluate head accelerations in both players involved in a football collision. Players on two opposing Canadian university teams were equipped with helmet mounted sensors during one game per season, for two consecutive seasons. A total of 276 collisions between 58 instrumented players were identified via video and cross-referenced with sensor timestamps. Player involvement (striking and struck), impact type (block or tackle), head impact location (front, back, left and right), and play type were recorded from video footage. While struck players did not experience significantly different linear or rotational accelerations between any play types, striking players had the highest linear and rotational head accelerations during kickoff plays (p ≤ .03). Striking players also experienced greater linear and rotational head accelerations than struck players during kickoff plays (p = .001). However, struck players experienced greater linear and rotational accelerations than striking players during kick return plays (p ≤ .008). Other studies have established that the more severe the head impact, the greater risk for injury to the brain. This paper's results highlight that kickoff play rule changes, as implemented in American college football, would decrease head impact exposure of Canadian university football athletes and make the game safer."
https://openalex.org/W3156554847,Concurrent Validity of a Stationary Cycling Test and the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test in Adults With Concussion,2021-04-22,2021,article,"Context After concussion, a multifaceted assessment is recommended, including tests of physical exertion. The current criterion standard for exercise testing after concussion is the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT); however, validated tests that use alternative exercise modalities are lacking. Objective To evaluate the feasibility and concurrent validity of a universal cycling test of exertion compared with the BCTT in adults who sustained a sport-related concussion. Design Crossover study. Setting University sports medicine clinic. Patients or Other Participants Twenty adults (age = 18–60 years) diagnosed with a sport-related concussion. Intervention(s) Participants completed the BCTT and a cycling test of exertion in random order, approximately 48 hours apart. Main Outcome Measure(s) The primary outcome of interest was maximum heart rate (HRmax; beats per minute [bpm]). Secondary outcomes of interest were the total number of symptoms endorsed on the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, whether the participant reached volitional fatigue (yes or no), the symptom responsible for test cessation (Post-Concussion Symptom Scale), maximum rating of perceived exertion, symptom severity on a visual scale (0–10), and the time to test cessation. Results Of the 20 participants, 19 (10 males, 9 females) completed both tests. One participant did not return for the second test and was excluded from the analysis. No adverse events were reported. The median HRmax for the BCTT (171 bpm; interquartile range = 139–184 bpm) was not different from the median HRmax for the cycle (173 bpm; interquartile range = 160–182 bpm; z = −0.63; P = .53). For both tests, the 3 most frequently reported symptoms responsible for test cessation were headache, dizziness, and pressure in the head. Of interest, most participants (64%) reported a different symptom responsible for cessation of each test. Conclusions On the novel cycling test of exertion, participants achieved similar HRmax and test durations and, therefore, this test may be a suitable alternative to the BCTT. Future research to understand the physiological reason for the heterogeneity in symptoms responsible for test cessation is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3153034394,Differences in Biomechanical Loading Magnitude During a Landing Task in Male Athletes With and Those Without Patellar Tendinopathy,2021-04-22,2021,article,"Context Researchers have not established if overloading or underloading movement profiles are present in symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes with patellar tendon structural abnormality (PTA) compared with healthy athletes. Objective To compare involved-limb landing biomechanics between male athletes with and those without patellar tendinopathy. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 43 male athletes were grouped based on patellar tendon pain and ultrasound imaging of the proximal patellar tendon: symptomatic with PTA (SYM; n = 13; age = 19.62 ± 1.61 years, height = 1.82 ± 0.05 m, mass = 83.46 ± 5.12 kg), asymptomatic with PTA (ASYM; n = 15; age = 21.13 ± 1.88 years, height = 1.84 ± 0.07 m, mass = 81.45 ± 13.26 kg), and healthy control (CON; n = 15; age = 19.60 ± 1.55 years, height = 1.84 ± 0.09 m, mass = 79.09 ± 12.37 kg). Main Outcome Measure(s) Three-dimensional biomechanics were collected during a double-limb jump-landing task. Kinematic (knee-flexion angle [KF]) and kinetic (vertical ground reaction force, internal knee-extension moment [KEM], patellar tendon force [FPT]) variables were analyzed as continuous waveforms during the stance phase for the involved limb. Mean values were calculated for each 1% of stance, normalized over 202 data points (0%–100%), and plotted with 95% CIs. Statistical significance was defined as a lack of 95% CI overlap for a minimum of a consecutive 3% of the stance phase. Results The SYM group had less KF than the CON group throughout the stance phase (8%–76%: Cohen d = 1.14 ± 0.12, mean difference [MD] = 15.83° ± 2.71°). The ASYM group had less KF than the CON group in the early (8%–13%: Cohen d = 0.99 ± 0.04, MD = 7.99° ± 0.39°; 21%–24%: Cohen d = 1.01 ± 0.01, MD = 11.11° ± 0.32°) and late (74%–94%: Cohen d = 0.96 ± 0.07, MD = 9.55° ± 1.13°) stance phases. The SYM group had a smaller KEM (6.5%–9%: Cohen d = 1.21 ± 0.08, MD = 0.04 ± 0.004 N·m/[Nbw·mht]) and less FPT (6%–9%: Cohen d = 1.15 ± 0.15, MD = 0.85 ± 0.15 body weight) than the CON group in the early stance phase. The SYM group also displayed a smaller KEM (38%–56%: Cohen d = 1.17 ± 0.06, MD = 0.03 ± 0.001 N·m/[Nbw·mht]) and less FPT (36%–60%: Cohen d = 1.22 ± 0.08, MD = 0.66 ± 0.05 body weight) than the ASYM group in the midstance phase. Conclusions The SYM group demonstrated a patellar tendon load-avoidance profile compared with the ASYM and CON groups. The ASYM group showed no evidence of overloading compared with the CON group. Our findings support the need for individualized treatments for athletes with tendinopathy to maximize load capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3157506903,Less is More: End-to-end Learning of Insights from a Single Motion Sensor for Accurate and Explainable Soccer Goalkeeper Kinematics,2021-04-22,2021,preprint,"On-field sensor-based soccer player tracking solutions are emerging and provide new insights into the dynamics of the player during training or a match. Yet, not all player positions are equally privileged. Goalkeepersâ training and performance assess- ment were for a long time ignored. Understanding what is âthe side of the post where most high dives were performedâ provides valuable input for both the trainer and the athlete to improve perfor- mance or avoid injuries. In the current study, we focus on a practical methodology to extract insights from goalkeeper kinematics to inform such analytics. We demonstrate that information from a single motion sensor can be successfully used for learning patterns in goalkeeperâs motion and provide an explainable goalkeeper kine- matics assessment. We employed raw and quaternions data and we evaluated a series of machine learning algorithms that discriminate dive types (i.e. binary classification) and dives from other types of specific motions (i.e. multi-class classification) directly from the data. Our results demonstrate that XGBoost outperforms other approaches in terms of performance when considering both raw and quaternions, essentially benefiting from both types of data. Additionally, each prediction of the model is accompanied by an explanation of how each sensed motion component contributes to describing a specific goalkeeperâs action captured by the model. The explainable predictions along with the efficient deployment of XGboost were decisive in our applied study. We evaluated our methodology on a first batch of experiments using online available data from 7 goalkeepers during 30 minutes-long training sessions."

To get good results, in addition to the hard work and solid and effective training on weekdays, the qualification of the players is one of the key factors. Therefore, this research attempts to construct an artificial intelligence (AI) evaluation algorithm for rowing athletes to obtain advantages in the sports field, and can start from the athletes. The AI algorithm involves the hierarchical analysis method (AHP) is adopted to invite experts and scholars in the rowing field to answer the expert questionnaire. The TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) method is then applied to calculate the ranking of material selection indicators, aiming to construct an evaluation model for rowers. The main research result shows that physicality is considered as the highest priority among the four main criteria of talent identification, following in a descending order by specialism, reaction and psychological elements. The propose model established by the most beneficial decision model for identification of talented rowers in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4205183091,What’s New in Spine Surgery,2021-04-22,2021,editorial,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted the scientific enterprise, spine surgeons remained committed to improving the science of our discipline. We present a review of high-quality, peer-reviewed articles over the past year, revealing advances in our understanding of cervical myelopathy and trauma, deformity, spinal cord injury, and other degenerative spinal conditions. These articles were chosen for their originality, insightfulness, methodology, and potential impact on the field of spine surgery. COVID-19 and Spine Surgery The coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic, with 120 million infected people around the world and over 2.6 million lives lost by March 2021. This disease results in pulmonary compromise and the need for inpatient hospitalizations in a subset of patients. An estimated 3% to 32% of patients required intensive care support and artificial ventilation. Hospitals in the United States and across the world responded swiftly and in similar ways. Travel bans were rapidly initiated to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve the physician workforce, non-urgent surgical procedures were cancelled in order to increase hospital capacity for patients infected with the virus, and in-person clinics were cancelled and were replaced by telemedicine visits to slow down the rate of community spread. The economic impact on health care was staggering. In the initial weeks of the pandemic, 60,000 health-care jobs were lost1, and almost all interventional spine procedures were postponed or cancelled. Over 60% of spine surgeons reported reductions in their salary or benefits, and 17% reported that they, or other spine surgery providers, were involuntarily reassigned to cover non-neurosurgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-nine percent received no financial compensation for these work efforts, and 31% of respondents were compensated at a rate equal to or lower than their established salary rate. Cervical Pathologies Cervical Spondylosis and Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy Degenerative cervical myelopathy remains the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction. In a Level-I multicenter study, Fehlings et al. investigated whether riluzole enhances outcomes in patients undergoing a decompression and fusion procedure for degenerative cervical myelopathy. This was a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase-3 trial of patients undergoing a surgical procedure across 16 university-affiliated hospitals in the United States and Canada. Patients were randomized to either riluzole or placebo. The primary end point was a change in modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scores at 6 months after the surgical procedure. Secondary outcomes were changes from baseline in functional status (Nurick grade), disability (Neck Disability Index), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score, grip strength, Numeric Rating Scale scores, and quality of life (Short Form-36 [SF-36] and EuroQol-5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]). Of the 408 patients who were screened, 300 were eligible and 290 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 141) or the placebo group (n = 149), and 108 patients were excluded. The mean patient age was 58 years. Baseline characteristics were balanced between both groups. At 6 months after the surgical procedure, both patient groups showed improvement in mJOA scores; however, there were no between-group differences in the extent of improvement. Similarly, the extent of improvement from baseline in all secondary outcomes was not significantly different between both groups. At 1 year after the surgical procedure, the riluzole group demonstrated a greater reduction in neck pain, although pain was not a prespecified primary end point. Riluzole does not provide an additional benefit with respect to functional outcome scores in patients undergoing decompression and fusion for cervical myelopathy2. In a Level-I study investigating the effectiveness of local intraoperative corticosteroids at decreasing dysphagia after multilevel anterior discectomy and fusion surgical procedures3, Kim et al. demonstrated a significant decrease in the severity of postoperative dysphagia with local intraoperative corticosteroids. This was a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing multilevel anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Patients were randomized to receive the treatment (local corticosteroids) or placebo. Additionally, patients received 10 mL of intravenous dexamethasone, regardless of group allocation (institutional protocol). The primary outcome was change in swallowing assessed with the Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) and the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) Questionnaire. There were 128 patients who were eligible and were randomized, and 109 patients (56 in the treatment group and 53 in the control group) were used in the analysis. At baseline, both groups were balanced; however, the treatment group had a lower frequency of drain placement and shorter operative time. The EAT-10 scores were significantly lower in the corticosteroid group on postoperative day 2, and this difference was durable through 1 month after the surgical procedure. The findings of this study suggest that the local administration of corticosteroids after multilevel ACDF is associated with decreased severity of postoperative dysphagia3. Cervical Trauma In a Level-II study4, Buchanan et al. investigated whether the addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) adds value for patients presenting with acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury. This was a vignette-based study of patients presenting with acute spinal cord injury to a level-1 trauma center between 2010 and 2019. Patients included in the study presented to the emergency department with signs of quadriplegia, and underwent computed tomography (CT), MRI, and subsequently a surgical procedure within 48 hours of arrival. The clinical vignettes were presented to the surgeons in 2 phases. In phase I, the clinical vignettes were presented with only the corresponding CT scans, and in phase II, the vignettes were presented with both CT and MRI scans. A minimum washout period of 2 weeks was included between phases I and II to prevent recall bias. Twenty-nine patient vignettes were utilized for this study (a total of 174 surgical plans). The researchers found that surgical timing was changed in 55% of cases, approach was changed in 44% of cases, and targeted vertebral levels were changed in 63% of cases. Combined, 93% of surgical plans changed after the MRI. Collision sports have inherent risk of injuries, such as cervical spinal injuries. Up to 10% of injuries in the National Football League (NFL) are head, neck, and spine injuries. Return to play after cervical injuries is controversial, given the paucity of data on this topic. Using a modified Delphi methodology, Schroeder et al.5 attempted to establish return-to-play recommendations. They conducted a 3-round survey with fellowship-trained spinal surgeons and physicians from the NFL. The first-round survey was sent to all Cervical Spine Research Society (CSRS) members and consisted of 14 clinical scenarios and 38 questions related to cervical spine injuries in football. The results for this survey informed the development of 13 consensus statements, which were subsequently sent to CSRS members (second round). The feedback from the second survey was used to develop return-to-play recommendations for professional athletes who sustained cervical spine injuries. The researchers reported strong consensus among respondents that athletes with cervical spine injuries who undergo 1 or 2-level ACDF without increased T2 signal intensity may return to play. There was low consensus for returning to play for athletes who undergo a 3-level ACDF. For asymptomatic athletes without radiographic evidence of spinal cord injury (increased T2 signal intensity) and spinal canal diameter of >10 mm, there was strong consensus for returning to play. There was no consensus on retuning to play for cases with pseudarthrosis after ACDF. For athletes with a history of cervical spine injury, there was strong consensus for screening MRI scans before sports participation5. Cervical Deformity Adult cervical deformity is a common cause of disability in elderly patients. A surgical procedure for deformity correction is technically challenging and is associated with high complication rates and prolonged recovery. Kim et al.6 investigated the incidence, patient-level risk factors, and recovery rate of neurological complications in patients undergoing a corrective surgical procedure for adult cervical deformity. There were 106 patients enrolled in this multicenter study. The mean age was 60.8 years and the mean duration of follow-up was 18.2 months. Neurological complications occurred in 18.9% of patients, of which 68.1% were major complications. The majority (91%) of complications resolved within 6 months, with only 2% of patients with delayed neurological recovery. In a Level-III study, Lau et al. reported outcomes and complications profiles after a Smith-Petersen osteotomy compared with a 3-column osteotomy for the correction of adult cervical deformity. This was a retrospective, single-institution study of patients with adult, non-oncologic cervical deformity. Ninety-five patients with a diagnosis of cervical or cervicothoracic deformity were included. The mean patient age was 63.2 years, and 60% of patients were female. With regard to the mean preoperative values, the cervical sagittal vertical axis was 6.2 cm, the lordosis was 6.8°, the T1 slope was 40.9°, and the coronal Cobb angle was 6.7°. Forty-six patients underwent Smith-Petersen osteotomy and 49 patients underwent 3-column osteotomy. Three-column osteotomies were most commonly performed at T3 (26.5%), followed by T2 (20.4%). Overall, compared with baseline, there was a significant improvement in all cervical radiographic parameters. The combined complication rate (major and minor) was 37.9%. Neurological complications occurred in 16.8% of patients, surgical complications were seen in 17.9%, and medical complications were seen in 23.2% of patients. When comparing complication profiles, the overall complication rate was 32.6% in the Smith-Petersen osteotomy group and 42.9% in the 3-column osteotomy group. This difference was not significant. Complication rates were highest when osteotomies were performed at C7 (37.5%) and T1 (37.5%)7. Lumbar Stenosis, Spondylolisthesis, and Clinical Outcomes Endoscopic spinal surgery has grown in popularity over the past decade. Compared with traditional minimally invasive or open approaches, the use of endoscopy is associated with minimal tissue disruption and pain. To date, the preponderance of these studies focused on endoscopic discectomy, with few studies investigating the effectiveness of this approach for lumbar laminectomy. Salim et al. investigated the effectiveness of a unilateral endoscopic approach for bilateral decompression in patients with lumbar stenosis. The primary outcomes were changes in the visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, MacNab criteria, Medical Research Council (MRC) grading for leg strength, and ASIA score for sensation. Sixty patients (97 levels decompressed) with degenerative spinal stenosis were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 61 years and 38% of patients were male. The mean follow-up period was 30 months. Postoperatively, there was a significant improvement in back and leg pain and disability across all outcome measures assessed. Using the MacNab criteria, 88.4% showed excellent to good outcomes. A unilateral percutaneous endoscopic approach to perform bilateral decompression for patients with lumbar stenosis is both safe and effective8. Lumbar epidural steroid injections are commonly used for nonoperative management of lumbar radiculopathy. In patients who undergo failed conservative management and require a surgical procedure, it is unclear whether preoperative epidural steroid injections may increase risk of postoperative infection. In a retrospective study of 15,011 patients who underwent elective lumbar spine surgical procedures for radiculopathy and/or spinal stenosis at a single institution, Kreitz et al.9 investigated the temporal relationship between preoperative epidural steroid injection, patient demographic characteristics, and comorbidities on postoperative infection. Of the 15,011 patients enrolled, 5,108 underwent fusion procedures and 9,903 underwent decompression only. Patients were categorized as having no preoperative epidural steroid injection or a preoperative epidural steroid injection <30 days, 30 to 90 days, and >90 days prior to the surgical procedure. The primary outcome measure was postoperative surgical site infection requiring reoperation within 90 days of the surgical procedure. In the 9,903 patients who underwent decompression, 2,957 had a preoperative epidural steroid injection. Among the patients who underwent decompression, there was no increased rate of infection in the patients who had a preoperative epidural steroid injection compared with those patients who did not. Additionally, among patients who underwent decompression, there was no increased rate of infection in patients who had an epidural steroid injection within 30 days of a surgical procedure (508 patients) compared with those who had the injection at 30 to 90 days before the surgical procedure (1,252 patients) and those who had the injection >90 days before the surgical procedure (1,197 patients). Among the 5,108 patients who underwent fusion, 1,383 had a preoperative epidural steroid injection. In patients who underwent fusion, there was a significantly higher rate (p = 0.025) of postoperative infection for patients who had a preoperative epidural steroid injection (2.68%) compared with those who did not (1.69%). Additionally, among patients who underwent fusion, there was a significantly higher rate of infection among patients who had an epidural steroid injection within 30 days of the surgical procedure (5.74%; p = 0.005) and those who had the injection >90 days prior to the surgical procedure (2.9%; p = 0.022) compared with patients who had no preoperative epidural steroid injection. For patients who underwent fusion and had an epidural steroid injection between 30 and 90 days before the surgical procedure, there was no increased risk of postoperative infection. Regression analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated that lumbar fusion, body mass index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index were independent predictors of postoperative infection, and age, sex, and exposure to postoperative epidural steroid injection at any time point were not significantly predictive of infection. Exposure to preoperative epidural steroid injection had a marginal but insignificant impact on postoperative infection among all patients undergoing a lumbar surgical procedure9. Deformity Adult Spinal Deformity In a Level-III study, Yao et al. investigated the association between Hounsfield units (HU) at the planned upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) in patients with adult spinal deformity. This was a single-institutional study of 63 patients undergoing a corrective surgical procedure for adult spinal deformity. The primary outcome was the incidence of PJK. Local vertebra HU at the planned UIV and UIV+1 was measured using preoperative CT scans. HU were obtained using thin slices (thickness, 1.25 mm). Patients were divided into 1 of 3 groups: (1) no PJK, (2) non-osseous PJK, and (3) osseous PJK. Non-osseous PJK (type 1) was defined as PJK caused by disc and ligamentous lesions, and osseous PJK (type 2) was defined as PJK caused by bone failure. Of the 108 patients reviewed, 63 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 58 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 13 months. Seventy-five percent of patients were female, and 43% of cases were revision cases. The incidence of PJK was 24% at 6 weeks, 32% at 6 months, and 37% at 1 year. There were 16 patients in the non-osseous PJK group and 7 patients in the osseous PJK group. Post hoc analysis demonstrated significantly lower mean HU in the osseous PJK group than in the non-osseous PJK group. Patients with ≤120 HU had a risk of osseous PJK that was 5.74 times higher compared with those with >120 HU10. In an era of bundled payments in health care, understanding discharge disposition and costs after adult spinal deformity surgery is important. Theologis et al. investigated the costs and functional utility of post-discharge rehabilitation after corrective surgical procedures for adult spinal deformity. This was a single-center study of 937 operations for spinal deformity. The primary outcomes were rates of discharge to inpatient rehabilitation facility, costs and duration of stay, and change in the Functional Independence Measure. Of the 937 operations, 391 (41.7%) were followed by discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The mean patient age was 70.5 years, and the mean length of the in-hospital stay was 8.2 days. The mean duration of stay in the acute inpatient rehabilitation facility was 11.7 days and the mean cost of stay in the acute inpatient rehabilitation facility was $38,808. The Functional Independence Measure significantly improved over the duration of stay at the inpatient rehabilitation facility. The pre-admission Functional Independence Measure score was 66 and improved to 94 at discharge. Assuming a discharge disposition to rehabilitation rate of 41%, the total costs of inpatient rehabilitation are estimated to be $1,674,872 for every 100 patients undergoing a surgical procedure for adult spinal deformity. Future cost utility analysis may be needed to assess the added value of an inpatient rehabilitation stay11. Sex-based differences in health care, such as variance in the perception of pain and functional improvement after a surgical procedure between men and women, have been extensively studied. However, to date, there has been a paucity of data assessing the impact on sex on functional outcomes and complication rates after corrective surgical procedures for adult spinal deformity. In a Level-III, single-center study, Montgomery et al. investigated the relationship between sex and clinical outcomes. In the study, 156 patients with symptomatic adult spinal deformity were enrolled; 66.7% (104 patients) were female and the rest of the patients were male. At the time of the surgical procedure, the female patients were younger and had a higher prevalence of smoking. The female cohort had higher rates of baseline affective disorders, such as depression, as well as more severe baseline pain (assessed by the visual analog scale) and worse functional disability (assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] and Oswestry Disability Index scores). Postoperatively, the extent of functional improvement was greater in women than men, with no difference in postoperative complication rates. This study suggested that both sexes respond equally well to corrective surgery for adult spinal deformity12. Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis The relationship between pulmonary function and spinal deformity has generated substantial interest. Progressive spinal deformity can lead to pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory failure. In a Level-IV study, Deng et al. investigated the relationship between thoracic morphology and pulmonary function in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This was a single-center study of 108 patients. The following data were collected on all patients: costophrenic angle distance, distance between T1 and the mean diaphragm height (T1-diaphragm), T1-T12 height, and apical vertebral deviation ratio. Pulmonary function data included forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), vital capacity, total lung capacity, and their predicted values. The mean patient age was 15.6 years. The main thoracic Cobb angle was 78°. The mean costophrenic angle distance was 21.14 cm, and the mean apical vertebral deviation ratio was 0.21. The mean forced vital capacity was 2.31 L, which was 76.76% of the predicted value. There was a strong positive correlation between the costophrenic angle distance and forced vital capacity, FEV1, vital capacity, and total lung capacity, indicating that the costophrenic angle distance had a strong correlation with pulmonary volume. The authors observed that when the apical vertebral deviation ratio was <0.2, 93.1% of patients showed normal or mild lung function impairment. In contrast, when the apical vertebral deviation ratio was >0.2, 46% of patients demonstrated moderate to severe impairment. This study demonstrated that, in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, an apical vertebral deviation ratio of >0.2 is associated with moderate to severe impairment. Additionally, the costophrenic angle distance can be used to assess pulmonary function outcome13. Infantile, Congenital, and Early-Onset Scoliosis In patients with infantile idiopathic scoliosis, serial body casting arrests the progression of the deformity. Historically, serial body casting has been performed under general anesthesia; however, several reports have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of general anesthetics in young children. LaValva et al.14 investigated the outcomes of serial body cast placement with and without the use of general anesthesia in children with progressive infantile scoliosis. There were 121 patients enrolled in this multicenter study. Ninety-two patients underwent casting under general anesthesia, and 29 patients did not. At baseline, patients in the awake cohort (those who did not have general anesthesia) were older, had more severe curves, and had lower body mass index. The rate of success of casting was higher in the awake cohort, with similar rates of conversion to a surgical procedure in both patient cohorts. Awake casting may be a suitable and safe alternative to casting under general anesthesia in patients with symptomatic infantile scoliosis14. Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) is a heterogenous disease entity. There is a paucity of disease-specific data on health-related quality of life in this patient population. Ramo et al. investigated the influence of the classification of EOS etiology designation, radiographic parameters, and medical comorbidities on the Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ). In a multicenter prospective study, 610 patients with EOS were enrolled: 119 patients had congenital EOS, 201 had idiopathic EOS, 156 had neuromuscular EOS, and 134 had syndromic EOS. Scores were lower in many EOSQ domains (general health, transfer, fatigue, daily living, emotion) in patients with neuromuscular and syndromic etiologies. The total and subdomain scores were similar between patients with congenital EOS and those with idiopathic EOS. The severity of the deformity (assessed by coronal Cobb and kyphosis angles) was inversely associated with the EOSQ15. A hemivertebra is the most common cause of congenital scoliosis. The patient age and the number of hemivertebrae significantly affect the progression of the deformity. If improperly treated, the spinal deformity could become severe, compromising cardiac and pulmonary function; hence, timely surgical management is important. To date, there has been a paucity of long-term outcome data on patients undergoing surgical hemivertebra resection. In their study, Yang et al. reported on their single-institution experience and long-term outcomes after posterior hemivertebra resection in children <10 years of age. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in the study; of these patients, 21 were <10 years of age with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. The mean age at the time of surgical procedure was 4.7 years. Ten patients had thoracolumbar resected hemivertebrae, 4 patients had thoracic resected hemivertebrae, and 7 patients had lumbar resected hemivertebrae. The preoperative main curve Cobb angle was 32.7°, which improved to 10.3° postoperatively and to 15.4° at the last follow-up. Compared with preoperative values, the correction rate was 68.5% postoperatively and 52.9% at the last follow-up, reflecting a loss of correction of approximately 15.6% during the follow-up period. The postoperative coronal balance improved from 10.4 to 2.2 mm. The preoperative sagittal vertical axis was 6.7 mm and increased to 7.8 mm at the last follow-up. No patient had permanent neurological deficits, but 2 patients experienced deformity progression16. Conclusions Combined, these studies reflect meaningful advancements in our understanding and management of spinal cord dysfunction, degenerative spinal pathologies, and deformity. Improvements in augmented reality, biomechanics, neurotherapeutics, registry science, and artificial intelligence create exciting opportunities to improve the science of our discipline.

Does augmented reality navigation increase pedicle screw density compared to free-hand technique in deformity surgery? Single surgeon case series of 44 patients. Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2020 Sep 1;45(17):E1085-90. Compared with conventional, non-navigated pedicle screw placement, surgical navigation using intraoperative, 3-dimensional imaging has been shown to increase implant density and to improve screw placement accuracy, thereby decreasing implant-related complications as well. In this Level-III study, Edström et al. investigated whether the use of augmented reality navigation systems to place pedicle screws in deformity surgical procedures alters total implant density and the pedicle screw-to-hook ratio. A total of 44 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study (15 in the augmented reality navigation group and 29 in the control [free-hand technique] group). Implant density, defined as the combined number of screws and hooks per level fused, was compared between the groups. Overall, the implant density was 88.5% in the augmented reality navigation group and 84.4% in the free-hand technique group. Compared with the free-hand technique group, the pedicle screw density was higher in the augmented reality navigation group, and the hook density was lower. At the UIV and UIV+1, the pedicle screw density was significantly higher in the augmented reality navigation group. There was no significant difference in the total procedure time between the groups. Augmented reality and navigation have been fully integrated into routine clinical practice. The use of these technologies has improved the accuracy of implant placement, but do lead to increased implant density.

Improvement in SRS-22R self-image correlate most with patient satisfaction after 3-column osteotomy. Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2020 Dec 17. [Epub ahead of print]. In this Level-III study, Gum et al. investigated the relationship between patient satisfaction, patient-reported outcomes, and radiographic parameters in adult patients with spinal deformity undergoing a 3-column osteotomy. This was a multicenter, retrospective study utilizing the International Spine Study Group (ISSG) database. There were 135 patients with follow-up of 2 years enrolled in the study. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were female, with a mean age of 61 years and a mean body mass index of 29.7 kg/m2. The majority (73%) were primary surgical procedures. There was significant improvement in all patient-reported outcome measures and radiographic parameters, except for the coronal vertical axis. The majority of patients were satisfied with their outcomes. Patient satisfaction was positively strongly correlated with the Self-Image domain in the Scoliosis Research Society 22-item (SRS-22R) questionnaire. This is an interesting study. Historically, for older patients, pain and desire for improved function were the drivers of the need for surgical corrections. This article suggested that self-image appears to be a driver for a surgical procedure in this patient population.

Association between social determinants of health and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusions: a matched analysis. Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2021 May 1. Across several specialties, social determinants of health have been shown to affect disease outcomes and treatment success. Khalid et al. investigated the influence of social determinants of health on postoperative complication and hospital readmission rates after lumbar spine surgical procedures. The 5 categories of social determinants of health include economic, education, health-care, environmental, and social. In this study, 16,560 patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusion were enrolled. Fifty percent of patients had a social determinant of health disparity and the other 50% did not. Both groups were balanced at baseline for clinical and demographic variables. The postoperative complication rate was higher in the group with a social determinant of health disparity. In a multivariate regression model, the presence of a social determinant of health disparity was associated with 70% increased odds of developing a postoperative complication. Over the past 2 decades, a large, compelling body of evidence has demonstrated a powerful role for social factors, apart from medical care, in shaping health outcomes across a wide range of diseases and populations. This evidence does not deny that medical care influences health; rather, it indicates that medical care is not the only influence on health and suggests that the effects of medical care may be more limited than commonly thought.

Surgical management of complex post-tuberculous kyphosis among African patients: clinical and radiographic outcomes for a consecutive series treated at a single institution in West Africa. Spine Deform. 2021 Jan 5. [Epub ahead of print]. Tuberculosis remains a challenge for several countries in the developing world. Skeletal tuberculosis may be present in up to 10% of patients infected with tuberculosis. A subset of patients develops post-tuberculosis kyphotic deformity, which can lead to restrictive cardiopulmonary disease and potentially late-onset neurological deficits many years after the resolution of the initial infection. Posterior approaches such as costotransversectomy pedicle subtraction osteotomy and posterior vertebral column resection have been demonstrated to be safe and effective techniques to correct the spinal deformity and decompress the neural elements, while avoiding an anterior transthoracic osteotomy. Maziad et al. presented their radiographic and clinical outcomes after 57 patients with severe post-tuberculosis kyphosis underwent correction with posterior vertebral column resection technique with or without preoperative halo gravity traction at a single institution in West Africa. The mean patient age was 19 years. Thirty-six patients were male, and 21 patients were female. Preoperative halo gravity traction was used in 40% of patients at a mean duration of 86 days. Compared with the non-traction group, the baseline kyphosis was higher in patients who underwent preoperative traction at 125° compared with 65°. The mean post-halo gravity traction regional kyphosis was corrected to 101°. Postoperatively, 7% of patients had wound infection, 5% had implant failure, 3.5% had junctional failure, 3.5% had sacral ulcers, 1.7% had neurological failure, and 1.7% had a wound problem. The majority of patients demonstrated significant improvements in all radiographic parameters as well as SRS total and domain scores. This is the first study to address this question in a West African population. The authors reported excellent deformity correction and outcomes, despite performing these complex surgical procedures in a resource-limited climate.

Brain Sci. 2021 Jan 10;11(1):83. Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a common cause of low back pain and radicular symptoms. Although the majority of patients can be managed without a surgical procedure, a subset of patients requires a surgical procedure. In cases of dynamic spondylolisthesis, decompression with fusion is the optimal surgical approach; however, there remains an ongoing debate on whether decompression alone is sufficient in patients with non-dynamic spondylolisthesis. Sriphirom et al. investigated the clinical outcomes associated with interlaminar percutaneous endoscopic decompression in patients with stable degenerative spondylolisthesis. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in this single-center, Level-III study. The mean follow-up duration was 25 months. At the last follow-up, patient-reported outcome measures including the visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index were significantly improved from baseline. No patients developed postoperative spinal instability. The use of endoscopic techniques continues to miniaturize approaches to spinal disorders. These technologies have been primarily deployed for discectomies; however, this study demonstrated that endoscopic techniques can be safely utilized for the treatment of other common degenerative spinal disorders."

Yet, not all player positions are equally privileged. Goalkeepers’ training and performance assess- ment were for a long time ignored. Understanding what is ”the side of the post where most high dives were performed” provides valuable input for both the trainer and the athlete to improve perfor- mance or avoid injuries. In the current study, we focus on a practical methodology to extract insights from goalkeeper kinematics to inform such analytics. We demonstrate that information from a single motion sensor can be successfully used for learning patterns in goalkeeper’s motion and provide an explainable goalkeeper kine- matics assessment. We employed raw and quaternions data and we evaluated a series of machine learning algorithms that discriminate dive types (i.e. binary classification) and dives from other types of specific motions (i.e. multi-class classification) directly from the data. Our results demonstrate that XGBoost outperforms other approaches in terms of performance when considering both raw and quaternions, essentially benefiting from both types of data. Additionally, each prediction of the model is accompanied by an explanation of how each sensed motion component contributes to describing a specific goalkeeper’s action captured by the model. The explainable predictions along with the efficient deployment of XGboost were decisive in our applied study. We evaluated our methodology on a first batch of experiments using online available data from 7 goalkeepers during 30 minutes-long training sessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
https://openalex.org/W3154335179,Treatment of post-meniscectomy knee symptoms with medial meniscus replacement results in greater pain reduction and functional improvement than non-surgical care,2021-04-21,2021,article,"Abstract Purpose Partial meniscectomy is a common orthopedic procedure intended to improve knee pain and function in patients with irreparable meniscal tears. However, 6–25% of partial meniscectomy patients experience persistent knee pain after surgery. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving subjects with knee pain following partial meniscectomy, it was hypothesized that treatment with a synthetic medial meniscus replacement (MMR) implant provides significantly greater improvements in knee pain and function compared to non-surgical care alone. Methods In this prospective, multicenter RCT, subjects with persistent knee pain following one or more previous partial meniscectomies were randomized to receive either MMR or non-surgical care. This analysis evaluated the 1-year outcomes of this 2-year clinical trial. Patient-reported knee pain, function, and quality of life were measured using nine separate patient-reported outcomes. The primary outcomes were the pain subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the average of all five KOOS subscales (KOOS Overall). Treatment cessation was defined as permanent device removal in the MMR group and any surgical procedure to the index knee in the non-surgical care group. Results Treated subjects had a median age of 52 years old (range 30–69 years) and one or more previous partial meniscectomies at a median of 34 months (range 5–430 months) before trial entry. Among 127 subjects treated with either MMR ( n = 61) or non-surgical care ( n = 66), 11 withdrew from the trial or were lost to follow-up (MMR, n = 0; non-surgical care, n = 11). The magnitude of improvement from baseline to 1 year was significantly greater in subjects who received MMR in both primary outcomes of KOOS Pain ( P = 0.013) and KOOS Overall ( P = 0.027). Treatment cessation was reported in 14.5% of non-surgical care subjects and only 4.9% of MMR subjects (n.s.). Conclusion Treatment with the synthetic MMR implant resulted in significantly greater improvements in knee pain, function, and quality of life at 1 year of follow-up compared to treatment with non-surgical care alone.

https://openalex.org/W3159701637,Measuring Gait Velocity and Stride Length with an Ultrawide Bandwidth Local Positioning System and an Inertial Measurement Unit,2021-04-21,2021,article,"One possible modality to profile gait speed and stride length includes using wearable technologies. Wearable technology using global positioning system (GPS) receivers may not be a feasible means to measure gait speed. An alternative may include a local positioning system (LPS). Considering that LPS wearables are not good at determining gait events such as heel strikes, applying sensor fusion with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) may be beneficial. Speed and stride length determined from an ultrawide bandwidth LPS equipped with an IMU were compared to video motion capture (i.e., the “gold standard”) as the criterion standard. Ninety participants performed trials at three self-selected walk, run and sprint speeds. After processing location, speed and acceleration data from the measurement systems, speed between the last five meters and stride length in the last stride of the trial were analyzed. Small biases and strong positive intraclass correlations (0.9–1.0) between the LPS and “the gold standard” were found. The significance of the study is that the LPS can be a valid method to determine speed and stride length. Variability of speed and stride length can be reduced when exploring data processing methods that can better extract speed and stride length measurements."

There was a high level of concern that these athletes were ill-prepared for competition and would experience an increased risk of injury under the restricted play rules.The data in our study were compiled using publicly accessible records of players placed on injured lists from 2015 to 2020. These records came from 4 open access websites: rotoworld.com, fangraphs.com, foxsports.com, and spotrac.com. All injuries were confirmed using the transaction database found on the official MLB website (mlb.com).A greater proportion of pitchers were injured during the first 30 days of the 2020 season compared to the first 30 days of any of the 5 prior seasons (29.74% vs. 11.72%, n=2190, P<.001). There was a demonstrated increase in injury risk in 2020 for the following anatomic locations: back and trunk, shoulder, upper arm and elbow, forearm and wrist, and hand and finger (P=.02; confidence interval [0.497-5.783]). When dividing the first month of play in 2020 into equal halves (15 days each), the number of relief pitcher injuries increased with time (60% vs. 78%, P=.04). Lastly, there was no proportional difference in placement on the short-term vs. long-term injured list.A significantly large increase in soft tissue injuries in 2020 compared to the prior 5 seasons predominantly affected the trunk and the upper extremity of pitchers in the first 30 days of play. Alterations to preseason training and regular season play in the 2020 MLB season due to coronavirus disease 2019 may have been particularly disadvantageous to professional pitchers who are positioned at baseline, the most injury prone position."
https://openalex.org/W3152499449,Reduction of Risk Factors for ACL Re-injuries using an Innovative Biofeedback Approach: Rationale and Design,2021-04-20,2021,article,"Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries with 90% of these athletes electing to undergo an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) at an estimated annual cost of $3 billion. While ACLR and subsequent rehabilitation allow these athletes to return to sports, they have a 15-fold increased risk of second ACL injuries. The modification of post-operative rehabilitation to improve movement and loading symmetry using visual and tactile biofeedback could decrease the risk factors for sustaining a second ACL injury. Participants included 40 adolescent ACLR patients who were intending to return to full sport participation. This preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the changes in knee extension moment symmetry, a known risk factor for second ACL injuries, during landing from a stop-jump task between the following time-points: pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and subsequent follow-up 6-weeks post-intervention. Participants met twice per week for six-weeks (12-session). The intervention included bilateral squat biofeedback (visual and tactile); the attention control group attended weekly educational sessions. This RCT enrolled and randomize 40 participants over a two-and-a-half-year period. All participants were greater than 4.5 months post-op from a primary, unilateral ACLR and were released to participate by their treating physician. The findings from this pilot biofeedback RCT will provide critical effect size estimates for use in subsequent larger clinical trials."

Here, we provide a review of recent research articles and appraise the evidence that bone matrix quality is clinically important and possibly targetable for fracture prevention. Deformation of mineralised collagen fibrils determines bone fracture mechanics. Slipping and separation at the mineral-fibril and fibril-fibril interfaces, respectively, are the structural mechanisms for plastic deformation and microcrack nucleation. Existing technologies for assessing bone tissue in vivo cannot measure matrix structure or fracture mechanics but have shown limited use in clinical settings for identifying fragility or following treatment outcomes based on composition. Matrix is biomechanically and clinically important, but the knowledge has not translated into clinical practice. The structural mechanisms by which a load is transferred from mineralised collagen fibrils to the whole bone via microcracking have been proven too complex to measure in vivo. The mineral-fibril or fibril-fibril interfaces might be suitable targets for diagnosing fragility or delivering molecules that reduce fracture risk by strengthening the mineral bonds while maintaining flexibility in the fibrils."

Yet, little is known about knee‐joint loading, particularly in the patellofemoral‐joint, despite patellofemoral‐joint osteoarthritis commonly occurring post‐ACLR. This study compared knee‐joint reaction forces and impulses during the landing phase of a single‐leg forward hop in the reconstructed knee of people 12‐24 months post‐ACLR and uninjured controls. Experimental marker data and ground forces for 66 participants with ACLR (28 ± 6 years, 78 ± 15 kg) and 33 uninjured controls (26 ± 5 years, 70 ± 12 kg) were input into scaled‐generic musculoskeletal models to calculate joint angles, joint moments, muscle forces, and the knee‐joint reaction forces and impulses. The ACLR group exhibited a lower peak knee flexion angle (mean difference: −6°; 95% confidence interval: [−10°, −2°]), internal knee extension moment (−3.63 [−5.29, −1.97] percentage of body weight × participant height (body weight [BW] × HT), external knee adduction moment (‐1.36 [−2.16, −0.56]% BW × HT) and quadriceps force (−2.02 [−2.95, −1.09] BW). The ACLR group also exhibited a lower peak patellofemoral‐joint compressive force (−2.24 [−3.31, −1.18] BW), net tibiofemoral‐joint compressive force (−0.74 [−1.20, 0.28] BW), and medial compartment force (−0.76 [−1.08, −0.44] BW). Finally, only the impulse of the patellofemoral‐joint compressive force was lower in the ACLR group (−0.13 [−0.23, −0.03] body weight‐seconds).

The study was split into two sub-sections; the inter-day reliability of three upper-extremity performance tests (n = 21) and a descriptive, correlation study investigating the relationship between isokinetic dynamometry and performance tests metrics (n = 39). We used intraclass correlation coefficients (absolute agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model) with 95% confidence intervals to quantify inter-day reliability of all variables. We used Pearson correlation coefficients to investigate associations between isokinetic strength and vertical ground reaction force asymmetry variables. Inter-day reliability was moderate-to-excellent for the upper-extremity performance tests (ICC 0.67–0.97). There was no statistically significant correlation between external and internal rotational peak torque and the variables of CPMU, PJ and BDL (r range = .02–.24).These upper-extremity tests are reliable for use with male contact/collision athletes."

On day 1, lower-body stiffness, power and force were assessed via countermovement jumps, followed by an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion to measure maximal aerobic capacity. On day 2, 2 SRE tests were performed before and after a repeated-sprint protocol with heart rate, minute ventilation, and blood lactate measured.Pooled group analysis indicated no significant changes for SRE following RSA due to variability in individual responses, with a potentiation or impairment effect of up to 4.5% evident across soccer players. The SRE responses to RSA were significantly and largely correlated to players' lower-body stiffness (r = .670; P = .024), and moderately (but not significantly) correlated to players' force production (r = -.455; P = .237) and blood lactate after RSA (r = .327; P = .326).In summary, SRE response to RSA in elite male soccer players appears to be highly individual. Higher lower-body stiffness appears as a relevant physical contributor to preserve or improve SRE following RSA."

Recent insights on intramuscular hamstring coordination revealed the semitendinosus (ST) to be of crucial importance for hamstring functioning, especially during heavy eccentric hamstring loading. Scientific evidence on the consequences of ST tendon harvest for ACLR is scarce and inconsistent. This study intended to investigate the repercussions of ST harvest for ACLR on hamstring muscle function. Hypothesis: Harvest of the ST tendon for ACLR was expected to have a significant influence on hamstring muscle activation patterns during eccentric exercises, evaluated at RTP in a population of male soccer athletes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 30 male soccer players with a history of ACLR who were cleared for RTP and 30 healthy controls were allocated to this study during the 2018-2019 soccer season. The influence of ACLR on hamstring muscle activation patterns was assessed by comparing the change in T2 relaxation times [ΔT2 (%) = [Formula: see text]] of the hamstring muscle tissue before and after an eccentric hamstring loading task between athletes with and without a recent history of ACLR through use of muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging, induced by an eccentric hamstring loading task between scans. Results: Significantly higher exercise-related activity was observed in the biceps femoris (BF) of athletes after ACLR compared with uninjured control athletes (13.92% vs 8.48%; P = .003), whereas the ST had significantly lower activity (19.97% vs 25.32%; P = .049). Significant differences were also established in a within-group comparison of the operated versus the contralateral leg in the ACLR group (operated vs nonoperated leg: 14.54% vs 11.63% for BF [ P = .000], 17.31% vs 22.37% for ST [ P = .000], and 15.64% vs 13.54% for semimembranosus [SM] [ P = .014]). Neither the muscle activity of SM and gracilis muscles nor total posterior thigh muscle activity (sum of exercise-related ΔT2 of the BF, ST, and SM muscles) presented any differences in individuals who had undergone ACLR with an ST tendon autograft compared with healthy controls. Conclusion: These findings indicate that ACLR with a ST tendon autograft might notably influence the function of the hamstring muscles and, in particular, their hierarchic dimensions under fatiguing loading circumstances, with increases in relative BF activity contribution and decreases in relative ST activity after ACLR. This between-group difference in hamstring muscle activation pattern suggests that the BF partly compensates for deficient ST function in eccentric loading. These alterations might have implications for athletic performance and injury risk and should probably be considered in rehabilitation and hamstring injury prevention after ACLR with a ST tendon autograft."
https://openalex.org/W3135041259,Measuring Psychological Load in Sport,2021-04-16,2021,review,"Abstract Monitoring the physical load undertaken by athletes and examining the subsequent relationship with performance and injury and illness risk is common practice in high performance sport. Less attention has been paid to the psychological factors contributing to the overall load experienced and the impact upon health status and performance. This paper discusses considerations for the conceptualization and measurement of psychological load in sport. First, we outline the importance of ensuring conceptual clarity is adopted in the measurement of psychological load. Next, we discuss the challenges to measuring psychological load in a comparable manner to which physical load is currently evaluated, including use of subjective assessment, adoption of specific and global approaches, and development of measurement instrumentation, techniques, and expertise. We then offer recommendations for practitioners when undertaking assessment of psychological load in sport. We conclude with future research directions to advance the study and measurement of the construct, including the interaction between psychological and physical load, the appraisal of the load faced, and personal and social resources available to successfully cope. We also highlight the need to consider groups of athletes (e. g., transitioning athlete, long-term injured) at greater risk from threats to mental and physical health from increased psychological load."
https://openalex.org/W3155692364,Effect of the Perception of Knee Pain on Muscle Strength and Endurance among Elite Female Handball Players,2021-04-16,2021,article,"Abstract Objectives This study aimed to examine the effect of knee pain perception on muscle strength and endurance among elite female handball players. Methods This study included 60 handball players who participated in training and competition from January to December 2019. Muscle strength, endurance, and hamstring/quadriceps ratio of the knee were estimated using Computer Sports Medicine, INC (Cybex, HUMAC, USA). The independent samples t-test was used for inter-group comparison. The Pearson’s correlation and simple linear regression analyses were used to assess associations among the variables and identify factors affecting pain perception, respectively. Results No significant differences in knee muscle strength, endurance of both the flexor and extensor muscles, and muscle strength (hamstring/quadriceps ratio) were noted between the high and low groups. However, the ratio of muscle endurance of the flexor and extensor of the knee in the high group was significantly lower than that in the low group. Furthermore, pain was found to correlate only with muscle endurance (hamstring/quadriceps ratio). The pain scale reading increased by 1. Moreover, muscle endurance ratio of the flexor and extensor muscles of the knee decreased by 3.07. Conclusion Muscle endurance (hamstring/quadriceps ratio) of the flexor and extensor muscles, classified based on an average pain scale, differed between the high and low groups. These results can aid in development of rehabilitation and exercise programs for players involved in handball and similar sports in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3155529097,The Relationship between Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Jumps and Their Influence on Speed Abilities: Gender Consideration,2021-04-16,2021,article,"Purpose: Plyometric exercises, in the form of jumping, are extreme physical activities. The aim of the study was to determine how symmetrical-single versus asymmetrical-continued plyometric exercises differ between men and women and affect speed abilities. Methods: Twenty-two healthy females and forty-four males from different sports practices participated in the investigation. The countermovement jump (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) of 40/60 cm box were performed on two independent and synchronized force platforms (Bilateral Tensiometric Platform S2P, Ljubljana, Slovenia). The measurement of a standing long jump (SLJ) and all continuous jumps: standing five jumps (SFJ), standing bounce triple jump (SBTJ), five double-leg jumps (FD-LJ), and a 10 m horizontal single leg jump (HSLJ-10mL/R) were performed using OptoJump–Next Microgate (OptoJump, Bolzano, Italy). Results: Statistically significant differences were noted in all jump kinematic and somatic parameters, in favor of the men. The correlations between values of height of symmetrical jumps (bilateral) and distance (SLJ) were stronger in women despite the shorter jumps than the men. When an alpha-level of 0.01 was set, this study demonstrated a stronger correlation between symmetrical-single and asymmetrical-continuous plyometrics exercises and sprints, both men and women. This relationship is due to their similar kinematic and dynamic structures with sprinting steps. Conclusions: The results showed a large dispersion of the relationship (p &lt; 0.05) between jumps and sprints divided into 10, 20 and 30 m, both in men and women. Both types of exercises implemented as a plyometric training regime are an extremely important tool for sprint speed development."

Risk factors associated with a second ACL injury are complex. Purpose: To investigate the combinations of various clinical risk factors associated with second ACL injury in female soccer players with a primary unilateral ACL reconstruction, using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 117 active female soccer players (mean ± SD age, 20 ± 2 years) were included. Athletes were enrolled 19 ± 9 months after ACL reconstruction and were prospectively followed for 2 years. At baseline, all players underwent assessment of knee and ankle joint range of motion (ROM), participated in functional tests (postural control, hop performance, and movement asymmetries in the lower limbs and trunk), and answered questionnaires (patient-reported knee function, knee-related quality of life, psychological and personality factors). A clinical prediction model using CART was developed. Results: A total of 28 players (24%) sustained a second ACL injury (21 ipsilateral and 7 contralateral ruptures) while playing soccer. CART analysis selected 9 of 19 independent variables associated with second ACL injury: the 5-jump test, knee collapse on the non–ACL reconstructed leg in a drop vertical jump, tuck jump, limb symmetry index on side hop and the single hop for distance, side difference in ankle dorsiflexion ROM, and scores for the questionnaires ACL-Return to Sport After Injury and the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality subscales of Stress Susceptibility and Adventure Seeking. The accuracy of the model was 89%, with 100% sensitivity and 76% specificity. CART analysis indicated that the interaction of longer jumps in the 5-jump test (&gt;916 cm) with more side difference in ankle dorsiflexion ROM (&gt;–2.5°) and more knee valgus collapse in the nonreconstructed knee (&gt;−1.4 cm) (relative risk, 4.03; 95% CI, 2.21-7.36) best predicted an increased likelihood of a second ACL injury. Conclusion: The risk profiles selected by CART could accurately identify female soccer players at high risk for a second ACL injury. There was an interaction between functional performance, clinical assessment, and psychological factors, and it is reasonable to include these factors in return-to-sport decisions and in athlete screening after ACL injury."

Machine learning (ML) methods could be used to improve injury prediction and allow proper approaches to injury prevention. The aim of our study was therefore to perform a systematic review of ML methods in sport injury prediction and prevention. Methods A search of the PubMed database was performed on March 24th 2020. Eligible articles included original studies investigating the role of ML for sport injury prediction and prevention. Two independent reviewers screened articles, assessed eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Methodological quality and risk of bias were determined by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Study quality was evaluated using the GRADE working group methodology. Results Eleven out of 249 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Different ML methods were used (tree-based ensemble methods ( n = 9), Support Vector Machines ( n = 4), Artificial Neural Networks ( n = 2)). The classification methods were facilitated by preprocessing steps ( n = 5) and optimized using over- and undersampling methods ( n = 6), hyperparameter tuning ( n = 4), feature selection ( n = 3) and dimensionality reduction ( n = 1). Injury predictive performance ranged from poor (Accuracy = 52%, AUC = 0.52) to strong (AUC = 0.87, f1-score = 85%). Conclusions Current ML methods can be used to identify athletes at high injury risk and be helpful to detect the most important injury risk factors. Methodological quality of the analyses was sufficient in general, but could be further improved. More effort should be put in the interpretation of the ML models."

Para sport is played by individuals with impairment, and they have a unique set of considerations not captured by these recommendations. Therefore, the aim of this addendum to IOC consensus statement was to guide the Para sport researcher through the complexities and nuances that should be taken into consideration when collecting, registering, reporting and interpreting data regarding Para athlete health. To develop this translation, experts in the field of Para sports medicine and epidemiology conducted a formal consensus development process, which began in March 2020 with the formation of a consensus group that worked over eight phases, incorporating three virtual consensus meetings to finalise the translation. This translation is consistent with the IOC consensus statement, yet provides more detailed Para athlete specific definitions and recommendations on study population, specifically, diagnostic and eligible impairment categorisation and recording of adaptive equipment, and defining and classifying health problems in the context of Para sport. Additionally, recommendations and Para athlete specific examples are described with regards to injury mechanism, mode of onset, injury and illness classification, duration, capturing and reporting exposure and risk. Finally, methods and considerations are provided to cater to the varied needs of athletes with impairment with respect to data collection tools. This harmonisation will allow the science to develop and facilitate a more accurate understanding of injury and illness patterns for tailoring evidence-informed prevention programmes and enabling better planning of medical services for Para sport events."
https://openalex.org/W3152540851,Rapid Estimation of Entire Brain Strain Using Deep Learning Models,2021-04-14,2021,article,"Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformation resulting from a head impact is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain deformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE head models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This work aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature engineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a combination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in less than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a standard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and model initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive power of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features based on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head impacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of brain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended by incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: In addition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation monitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a large number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models."

Our results show that within 2 years of their first contact with one another, a community of 100 participants interacting everyday was able to build a shared language. The growth of linguistic systematicity, which included a decrease in use of pantomime, reduction of the amplitude of signs and an increase in articulation economy, showcases a learning, and social interaction process that constitutes a continuum and not a cut-off system. The human cognitive system is endowed with mechanisms for symbolization that allow the process of arbitrariness to unfold and the expansion of linguistic complexity. Our study helps to clarify the role of pantomime in a new sign language and how this role might be linked with language itself, showing implications for language evolution research."
https://openalex.org/W3155879932,Towards a comprehensive delineation of white matter tract-related deformation,2021-04-14,2021,preprint,"Abstract Finite element (FE) models of the human head are valuable instruments to explore the mechanobiological pathway from external loading, localized brain response, and resultant injury risks. The injury predictability of these models depends on the use of effective criteria as injury predictors. The FE-derived normal deformation along white matter (WM) fiber tracts (i.e., tract-oriented strain) has recently been suggested as an appropriate predictor for axonal injury. However, the tract-oriented strain only represents a partial depiction of the WM fiber tract deformation. A comprehensive delineation of tract-related deformation may improve the injury predictability of the FE head model by delivering new tract-related criteria as injury predictors. Thus, the present study performed a theoretical strain analysis to comprehensively characterize the WM fiber tract deformation by relating the strain tensor of the WM element to its embedded fiber tract. Three new tract-related strains with exact analytical solutions were proposed, measuring the normal deformation perpendicular to the fiber tracts (i.e., tract-perpendicular strain), and shear deformation along and perpendicular to the fiber tracts (i.e., axial-shear strain and lateral-shear strain, respectively). The injury predictability of these three newly-proposed strain peaks along with the previously-used tract-oriented strain peak and maximum principal strain (MPS) were evaluated by simulating 151 impacts with known outcome (concussion or non-concussion). The results preliminarily showed that four tract-related strain peaks exhibited superior performance than MPS in discriminating concussion and non-concussion cases. This study presents a comprehensive quantification of WM tract-related deformation and advocates the use of orientation-dependent strains as criteria for injury prediction, which may ultimately contribute to an advanced mechanobiological understanding and enhanced computational predictability of brain injury."

Thus, there is an onus on researchers and medical departments to develop a better understanding of the physical characteristics and demands, and the health and performance needs of female soccer players. In this review, we discuss the current research, as well as the knowledge gaps, of six major topics: physical demands, talent identification, body composition, injury risk and prevention, health and nutrition. Data on female talent identification are scarce, and future studies need to elucidate the influence of relative age and maturation selection across age groups. Regarding the physical demands, more research is needed on the pattern of high-intensity sprinting during matches and the contribution of soccer-specific movements. Injuries are not uncommon in female soccer players, but targeting intrinsically modifiable factors with injury prevention programmes can reduce injury rates. The anthropometric and physical characteristics of female players are heterogeneous and setting specific targets should be discouraged in youth and sub-elite players. Menstrual cycle phase may influence performance and injury risk; however, there are few studies in soccer players. Nutrition plays a critical role in health and performance and ensuring adequate energy intake remains a priority. Despite recent progress, there is considerably less research in female than male soccer players. Many gaps in our understanding of how best to develop and manage the health and performance of female soccer players remain."

Multivariable Cox regression analysis with HR was carried out to study potential predictors for subsequent ACL injury.Median follow-up was 4.3 (IQR 4.6) years after ACLR. The second ACL injury rate after return to training (RTT) was 17.8% (n=21), with 9.3% (n=11) to the ipsilateral and 8.5% (n=10) to the contralateral knee. Significant predictors for second ACL injury were a non-contact index ACL injury (HR 7.16, 95% CI 1.63 to 31.22) and an isolated index ACL injury (HR 2.73, 95% CI 1.06 to 7.07). In total, 11 of 26 players (42%) with a non-contact isolated index ACL injury suffered a second ACL injury. RTT time was not an independent predictor of second ACL injury, even though there was a tendency for a risk reduction with longer time to RTT.

The aim of this study was to quantify in vivo elongation patterns of the collateral ligaments throughout complete cycles of functional activities. Methods: Knee kinematics were measured using radiographic images captured with a mobile fluoroscope while healthy subjects performed level walking, downhill walking, and stair descent. The registered in vivo tibiofemoral kinematics were then used to drive subject-specific multibody knee models to track collateral ligament elongation. Results: The elongation patterns of the medial collateral ligament varied distinctly among its bundles, ranging from lengthening of the anterior fibers to shortening of the posterior bundle with increases in the knee flexion angle. The elongation patterns of the lateral collateral ligament varied considerably among subjects. It showed an average 4% shortening with increasing flexion until 60% to 70% of the gait cycle, and then recovered during the terminal-swing phase until reaching its reference length (defined at heel strike). Conclusions: The observed nonuniform elongation of the medial collateral ligament bundles suggests that single-bundle reconstruction techniques may not fully restore healthy ligament function. Moreover, the observed ligament elongation patterns indicate greater varus than valgus laxity in the loaded knee. Clinical Relevance: Through providing key knowledge about the in vivo elongation patterns of the collateral ligaments throughout complete cycles of functional activities, this study offers in vivo evidence for benchmarking ligament reconstruction and soft-tissue balancing in total knee arthroplasty."

Gruba (Mobilizasyon grubu n=26) ise 10 tekrarlı olacak şekilde quadriceps ve gastroknemius kaslarına hareketle birlikte mobilizasyon, hamstring kasına ise 3 tekrarlı olacak şekilde düz bacak kaldırma tekniği uygulandı. Teknikler uygulandıktan sonra çalışma öncesi yapılan değerlendirme parametreleri tekrar yapıldı. Mobilizasyon grubunun uygulama öncesi ve sonrasındaki değerleri incelendiğinde bütün parametrelerde istatistiksel olarak anlamlı sonuçlar bulunmuştur (p&amp;lt;0,05). Dinamik germe grubunda ise horizontal sıçrama testinde istatistiksel olarak anlamlı bir değişiklik görülmezken (p&amp;gt;0,05), diğer bütün parametrelerde anlamlı fark saptanmıştır. Çalışmanın fark analizi incelendiğinde ise, mobilizasyon grubu değerlerinde dinamik germe grubuna oranla daha anlamlı sonuçlar görülmüştür (p&amp;lt;0,05). Bu çalışmanın sonucunda her iki grupta da anlamlı sonuçlar bulunmuştur. Mobilizasyon tekniklerinin dinamik germeye oranla, sıçrama mesafesi, çeviklik performansı ve hamstring uzunluğu parametrelerinde daha iyi bir gelişim sağlaması sebebiyle aktivite öncesi dinamik germe egzersizleri yerine tercih edilebilir."

Since no vertical jump test includes the ball as a reference element, the effect that the ball would have in a vertical jump test is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the biomechanical differences between run-up vertical jump measurements without (Run-up Vertical Jump) and with ball inclusion (Heading Test).Twelve semi- and professional soccer players were recruited. Athletes performed both jump tests in a biomechanical laboratory, where kinetic and spatiotemporal variables were collected and compared using a Student's dependent t-test for paired samples.Overall, players performed a different jumping strategy during the heading test compared to the run-up vertical jump, exhibiting: 1) higher horizontal velocity during initial contact (+45.3%, P ≤ .001), 2) shorter contact time, greater rate of force development, and total impulse during push-off (+27.5%, +53%, and +10.6%, respectively, P ≤ .008), 3) higher CoM horizontal and resultant velocity during take-off (+76.1% and 20.5%, respectively, P ≤ .001), 4) better vertical jump performance (+4.3%, P ≤ .0001), and 5) larger body angle rotation during landing (+63.3%, P = .006), compared to run-up vertical jump (effect size: 0.78 to 3.7).In general, soccer players display greater vertical jump heights in heading test, which highlights the importance of including an overhead ball during soccer-specific jump tests. Coaches and practitioners are encouraged to assess, and perhaps develop, the jumping ability of soccer players using a suspended ball as a specific target."

Sixteen participants were assessed before and immediately after both stretching modalities. Kinematics of movement was measured by an optoelectronic system and esthetics was scored by a jury of professional dancers. Both stretching modalities led to significant kinematic differences compared with without stretching. Significant linear correlations between kinematic parameters and esthetic scores have been observed: improving dancers’ physical performances has noticeable impact on the perception of their movements.
https://openalex.org/W3142666822,Neuromuscular fatigue and recovery after strenuous exercise depends on skeletal muscle size and stem cell characteristics,2021-04-08,2021,article,"Abstract Hamstring muscle injury is highly prevalent in sports involving repeated maximal sprinting. Although neuromuscular fatigue is thought to be a risk factor, the mechanisms underlying the fatigue response to repeated maximal sprints are unclear. Here, we show that repeated maximal sprints induce neuromuscular fatigue accompanied with a prolonged strength loss in hamstring muscles. The immediate hamstring strength loss was linked to both central and peripheral fatigue, while prolonged strength loss was associated with indicators of muscle damage. The kinematic changes immediately after sprinting likely protected fatigued hamstrings from excess elongation stress, while larger hamstring muscle physiological cross-sectional area and lower myoblast:fibroblast ratio appeared to protect against fatigue/damage and improve muscle recovery within the first 48 h after sprinting. We have therefore identified novel mechanisms that likely regulate the fatigue/damage response and initial recovery following repeated maximal sprinting in humans."

Methods Eighteen soccer players who underwent ACLR and 18 normal soccer players were enrolled in this investigation (ACLR group; age, 26.11 ± 3.95 years; body mass index, 23.52 ± 2.69 kg/m 2 ; surgery time, 5 ± 3.30 years: control group; age, 25.83 ± 3.51 years; body mass index, 24.09 ± 3.73 kg/m 2 , respectively). Participants were evaluated during the landing maneuver before and after carrying out the high-intensity exercise bout using the Wingate test. The intensity of the exercise was defined as a blood lactate accumulation of at least 4 mmol/L. The dependent variables included sagittal-plane kinematics and kinetics of the ankle, knee and hip joints, and electromyography activity of the gastrocnemius, hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteus maximus. Results On 2 × 2 analysis of variance, none of the dependent variable showed significant exercise×group interactions. Regardless of group, significant main effects of exercise were found. Post-exercise landing was characterized by increased flexion of hip ( p = 0.01), knee ( p = 0.001), and ankle joints ( p = 0.002); increased extension moments of hip ( p = 0.009), knee ( p = 0.012), and ankle joints ( p = 0.003), as well as decreased quadriceps activity ( p = 0.007). Conclusion At 1 year or more post-ACLR, the effect of the high-intensity exercise bout on landing biomechanics is not expected to differ from that experienced by healthy soccer players."

Positional data of the players was obtained with a Local Position Measurement system. COD load (AU) was quantified based on the combination of velocity and change in heading direction. Additionally, total distance covered, running distance, acceleration count, deceleration count, and Rating of Perceived Exertion were measured. Criterion validity was assessed by correlating COD load and the load indicators. Construct validity was determined by testing the differences between the SSG field dimensions.Strong correlations were determined between COD load and total distance covered (r = 0.74, p < .01) and running distance (r = 0.84, p < .01). Middle and large field size resulted in highest COD load (p < .05).These results suggest that the COD load measure shows sufficient criterion and construct validity."

The aim of the study was the evaluation of a joint stress test to assess joint discomfort in subjects with activity-related knee joint discomfort (ArJD). Results Forty-five subjects were recruited to perform the single-leg-step-down (SLSD) test (15 subjects per group). Subjects with ArJD of the knee (age 22–62 years) were compared to healthy subjects (age 24–59 years) with no knee joint discomfort during daily life sporting activity and to subjects with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis of the knee joint (OA, Kellgren score 2–3, age 42–64 years). The subjects performed the SLSD test with two different protocols: (I) standardization for knee joint discomfort; (II) standardization for load on the knee joint. In addition, range of motion (ROM), reach test, acute pain at rest and after a single-leg squat and knee injury, and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) were assessed. In OA and ArJD subjects, knee joint discomfort could be reproducibly induced in a short time interval of less than 10 min (200 steps). In healthy subjects, no pain was recorded. A clear differentiation between study groups was observed with the SLSD test (maximal step number) as well as KOOS questionnaire, ROM, and reach test. In addition, a moderate to good intra-class correlation was shown for the investigated outcomes. Conclusions These results suggest the SLSD test is a reliable tool for the assessment of knee joint health function in ArJD and OA subjects to study the improvements in their activities. Further, this model can be used as a stress model in intervention studies to study the impact of stress on knee joint health function."

Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as contact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link between impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable sensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions operating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share these data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in the development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts forth two contributions: (1) a centralized, open-access platform for storing and sharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and (2) a deep learning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head impacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated instrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with FITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model, improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91% accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football head impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative research tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating a standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics."

One hundred healthy males and females participated in a drop vertical jump, and LEAs and LEKs were determined in dominant and non-dominant limbs. A 2-by-2 mixed model MANOVA was performed to compare LEAs and joint kinematics between sexes and limbs (dominant vs. non-dominant). Compared with males, females possessed a significantly greater pelvic tilt, femoral anteversion, Q-angle, and reduced tibial torsion. Females landed on the ground with significantly increased knee extension and ankle plantarflexion with reduced hip abduction and knee adduction, relatively decreased peak hip adduction, knee internal rotation, and increased knee abduction and ankle eversion. The non-dominant limb showed significantly increased hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation; knee flexion and internal rotation; and ankle inversion at initial contact. Further, the non-dominant limb showed increased peak hip and knee flexion, relatively reduced peak hip adduction, and increased knee abduction and internal rotation. It could be suggested that LEAs and LEKs observed in females and non-dominant limbs might contribute to a greater risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3143335635,The importance of intervertebral disc material model on the prediction of mechanical function of the cervical spine,2021-04-02,2021,article,"Abstract Background Linear elastic, hyperelastic, and multiphasic material constitutive models are frequently used for spinal intervertebral disc simulations. While the characteristics of each model are known, their effect on spine mechanical response requires a careful investigation. The use of advanced material models may not be applicable when material constants are not available, model convergence is unlikely, and computational time is a concern. On the other hand, poor estimations of tissue’s mechanical response are likely if the spine model is oversimplified. In this study, discrepancies in load response introduced by material models will be investigated. Methods Three fiber-reinforced C2-C3 disc models were developed with linear elastic, hyperelastic, and biphasic behaviors. Three different loading modes were investigated: compression, flexion and extension in quasi-static and dynamic conditions. The deformed disc height, disc fluid pressure, range of motion, and stresses were compared. Results Results indicated that the intervertebral disc material model has a strong effect on load-sharing and disc height change when compression and flexion were applied. The predicted mechanical response of three models under extension had less discrepancy than its counterparts under flexion and compression. The fluid-solid interaction showed more relevance in dynamic than quasi-static loading conditions. The fiber-reinforced linear elastic and hyperelastic material models underestimated the load-sharing of the intervertebral disc annular collagen fibers. Conclusion This study confirmed the central role of the disc fluid pressure in spinal load-sharing and highlighted loading conditions where linear elastic and hyperelastic models predicted energy distribution different than that of the biphasic model."

The urgent need to recognise EHS symptoms to protect all attendees’ health has considerably accelerated research examining the most effective cooling strategies and the development of wearable cooling technology and real-time temperature monitoring. While these technological advances will aid the early identification of EHS cases, there are several potential ethical considerations for governing bodies and sports organisers. For example, the impact of recently developed cooling wearables on health and performance is unknown. Concerning improving athletic performance in a hot environment, there is uncertainty about this technology’s availability to all athletes. Furthermore, the real potential to obtain real-time core temperature data will oblige medical teams to make crucial decisions around their athletes continuing their competitions or withdraw. Therefore, the aim of this review is (1) to summarise the practical applications of the most novel cooling strategies/technologies for both safety (of athletes, spectators and workers) and performance purposes, and (2) to inform of the opportunities offered by recent technological developments for the early recognition and diagnosis of EHS. These opportunities are presented alongside several ethical dilemmas that require sports governing bodies to react by regulating the validity of recent technologies and their availability to all."

Studies (all designs) investigating interventions for people with proximal hamstring tendinopathy were eligible. Outcomes included symptoms, physical function, quality of life and adverse events. Studies were screened for risk of bias. Reporting quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (Randomized Controlled Trials [RCT]) and the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist (Case Series). Effect sizes (Standard mean difference or Standard paired difference) of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were considered as small, medium and large respectively. Overall quality of evidence was rated according to GRADE guidelines.Twelve studies (2 RCTs and 10 case series) were included (n=424; males 229). RCTs examined the following interventions: platelet-rich plasma injection (n=1), autologous whole-blood injection (n=1), shockwave therapy (n=1) and multi-modal intervention (n=1). Case series included evaluation of the following interventions: platelet-rich plasma injection (n=3), surgery (n=4), corticosteroid injection (n=2), multi-modal intervention + platelet-rich plasma injection (n=1). Very low-level evidence found shockwave therapy was more effective than a multi-modal intervention, by a large effect on improving symptoms (-3.22 SMD; 95% CI -4.28, -2.16) and physical function (-2.42 SMD; 95% CI-3.33, -1.50) in the long-term.

All patients diagnosed with a MUCL injury and those who underwent repair were included using Clinical Modification and Current Procedural Terminology code 24345, referencing repair of the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow with local tissue. The extracted data included patient age at time of procedure, sex, race, region, year of surgery, insurance type, hospital setting, and any associated diagnoses with 90 days of the repair procedure. Standard descriptive methods characterized our study sample to calculate frequency counts and percentages. Means with respective standard deviations and/or standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and reported for continuous variables, whereas frequencies and percentages were reported for categorical variables. Pearson χ2 tests were used to determine differences between group proportion categorical variables. Significance was considered at a P ≤ .05.From 2007 to 2014, MUCL injuries showed an upward trend in incidence per 100,000 from 4.59 to 7.19 (56% increase) within the database population. Accordingly, the incidence of MUCL repair rose from 0.016 to 0.49 (2962%). However, from 2015-2017 there was a drop in both categories, as injury incidence fell from 7.19 to 1.48 whereas repair rates dropped from 0.49 to 0.012. The ages undergoing repair show a significant peak in 15-24-year-olds. The incidence of MUCL repair was greatest in the West and South (P < .01). Male patients had a greater incidence of MUCL injury, and a greater incidence of MUCL repair per 100,000 persons compared to females (P < .01).MUCL repair has emerged as a viable alternative to reconstruction in select indications. The impetus for this change may be to provide a quicker return to sport and fewer complications, largely due to recent improvements in surgical technique for MUCL repair. As anticipated, the incidence of MUCL repair had steadily increased in the United States from 2007 to 2014, with a subsequent relatively inexplicable decrease primarily in 2017, according to the database utilized in this study. The 15-24 year-old age group encompassing young athletes has the greatest incidence of repair by a significant margin.IV, Therapeutic Case Series."

The purpose of this commentary is to introduce clinicians to the concept of monitoring training load during rehabilitation, to review methods of quantifying internal and external loads, and to suggest ways that these technologies can be incorporated into rehabilitation progressions and return-to-sport decisions after anterior ACLr.Quantifying and identifying the effects of training load variables, external (distance, impacts, decelerations) and internal (heart rate, heart rate variability) workload, during rehabilitation can indicate both positive (improved physical, physiological, or psychological capacity) or negative (heightened risk for injury or illness) adaptations and allow for the ideal progression of exercise prescription. When used during return-to-sport testing, wearable technology can provide robust measures of movement quality, readiness, and asymmetry not identified during performance-based testing.Researchers have reported the actual in-game demands of men and women of various ages and competition levels during multi-directional sport. Wearable technology can provide similar variables during rehabilitation, home exercise programs, and during on-field transition back to sport to ensure patients have met the expected fitness capacity of their sport. Additionally, clinicians can use internal load measures to objectively monitor patient's physiological responses to rehabilitation progressions and recovery rather than relying on subjective patient-reported data.5."

The abnormal rotation and translation of the lateral femoral condyle posteroinferiorly relative to the lateral tibial plateau is thought to be related to the geometry of the tibial plateau.The purpose of the study was to mathematically model the posterior tibial plateau geometry in patients with ACL injuries and compare it with that of matched controls. The hypothesis was that increased convexity and steepness of the posterior aspect of the lateral plateau would subject knees to higher forces, leading to a potentially higher risk of ACL injury.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.We mathematically modeled the posterior curvature of the lateral tibial plateau in 64 patients with ACL injuries and 68 matched controls. Using sagittal magnetic resonance imaging scans of the knee, points on the articular cartilage of the posterolateral tibial plateau were selected and curve-fitted to a power function (y = a × xn ). For coefficient a and coefficient n, both variables modulated the shape of the curve, where a larger magnitude represented an increase in slope steepness. Groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney test and α < .05.There was a significant difference in surface geometry between the patients with ACL injuries and matched controls. The equation coefficients were significantly larger in the patients with ACL injuries: coefficient a (ACL injury, 0.9 vs control, 0.68; P < .0001) and coefficient n (ACL injury, 0.34 vs control, 0.30; P = .07). For coefficient a, there was a 78.9% sensitivity, 77.5% specificity, and odds ratio of 12.6 (95% CI, 5.5-29.0) for ACL injury using a cutoff coefficient a = .78.Patients with ACL injuries had a significantly greater posterolateral plateau slope. The steeper drop off may play a role in higher anterior translation forces, coupled with internal rotation torques on the knee in noncontact injury, which could increase ACL strain and predispose to ACL injury."

Bone bruise patterns may provide information regarding injury mechanisms.To compare bone bruise and meniscal injury patterns for ACL injuries sustained in soccer versus basketball.Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.Clinical notes, operative reports, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed for patients who sustained a noncontact ACL rupture while playing soccer or basketball between August 2016 and August 2018. The presence, location, and signal intensity of bone bruises on the tibia and femur were documented, and patterns were classified according to the location of the bone bruise in the lateral-medial direction. The meniscal and bone bruise injury patterns and the specific bone bruise locations were compared between the soccer and basketball groups.Overall, 138 patients were included (56 with soccer-related and 82 with basketball-related ACL injury). No significant difference between the groups was observed in bone bruise patterns (P = .743) or meniscal injury patterns (P = .952). Bone bruise on the lateral side only of both the femur and the tibia was the most common pattern in both soccer (41.9%) and basketball (47.0%) groups; the most common meniscal injury type was an isolated lateral meniscal injury in both soccer (50.0%) and basketball (45.0%) groups. For patients with bone bruises on both the lateral and the medial sides of both the femur and the tibia (BF+BT), the bone bruise signal intensity on the lateral side of the femur (P < .001) and tibia (P = .009) was significantly higher than that on the medial side for both groups. The bone bruises on the lateral side of the femur (P < .001) and tibia (P = .002) were significantly more anterior than those on the medial side for patients with the BF+BT pattern.No significant differences in bone bruise location or meniscal injury type were detected when comparing ACL injuries sustained during soccer versus basketball. The study results suggest a similar biomechanical loading pattern for ACL injuries in these sports."

Rheumatology therapists may provide work advice to employed patients but conducting a structured work assessment and providing vocational rehabilitation (VR) is unusual. As part of a VR trial, we developed a VR training course (Workwell). The course consisted of 3 elements: a pre-training self-study module (reading on ergonomics and activity analysis; activity analysis of at least 2 videos of people working; observing people working); a 2-day training course (how to conduct a structured work interview (the Work Environment Survey: WES); case studies; planning work interventions; practical workshops about VR strategies and solutions; addressing disclosure; writing reports); followed by a 1:1 one hour telephone call practising conducting the WES with a trainer, developing a treatment plan, and individual feedback. A “Workwell Solutions Manual” was also provided for use in practice, with information on legislation, patient booklets and work solutions linked to problems identified in the WES. Our aim was to evaluate therapists’ views about the course and its impact. Methods All therapists attending the Workwell course were asked to complete questionnaires pre- and post-training. These included: knowledge of and confidence in providing VR (measured on a 0-4 scale of very limited to excellent); the Evidence Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS); and views about course content and duration. Results Three courses were delivered: 32/40 attendees completed pre-and-post training questionnaires. All were occupational therapists (OTs): 30 women and 2 men; 2 NHS Band 5, 15 Band 6, 11 Band 7 and 4 Band 8; with 11 (SD 7) years’ experience in Rheumatology. Median scores of Knowledge of: VR; the VR process; VR strategies; relevant legislation and policies; and Confidence in: conducting a work assessment; and identifying work solutions, significantly increased from 1 (limited: IQR 1-2) to 3 (good: IQR 2-3) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Total EBPAS scores did not change. However, Openness sub-scale scores did (i.e. extent to which willing to use new research -based interventions): Pre 2 (moderate: IQR2-3) to Post 3 (great: IQR 3-3): p = 0.04. Most (i.e. 26-30) considered very/extremely relevant: the pre-training self-study; conducting the WES and case studies; practical workshops (workstation assessment; upper limb strategies; load handling; environment; disclosure); and the post-training 1:1 practice WES, treatment planning and feedback. The training about using the WES (roleplay by trainers; case studies and 1:1 telephone practice) was considered the most beneficial aspect. Of the 21 commenting on course length, 16 considered it about right and 5 wanted longer. Conclusion The 2-day VR course, plus 2 days self-study, led to significant improvements in knowledge and confidence in delivering VR amongst attending OTs. Work is a key component of OT. This training course could help expand work services in Rheumatology to keep patients working. Disclosure A. Hammond: None. S. Woodbridge: None. R. O'Brien: None. A. Ching: None. J. Parker: None."

An example is within grassroots football organisations in resource-scarce areas such as Makana, South Africa. Through embedded participatory approaches, the research problem was co-constructed: To investigate the socio-technical system of the Makana Local Football Association (LFA). Method: A useful complex system modelling tool is that of Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), with its 5 phases used to identify constraints and affordances. Three perspectives were adopted for the application of an adapted (to suit participant characteristics) CWA to the Makana LFA: 1) how work is prescribed by the governing body SAFA, 2) how subject matter experts (SME) disclose its current functioning, and 3) how SMEs imagine it could function. Five SMEs attended 12 three-hour workshops to complete the latter two perspectives. Results: The composite work domain analysis between work as prescribed and work as disclosed identified significant mismatches between how policymakers envision the system and how SMEs report its functioning. Key differences in perspectives included the fundamental purpose of the Makana LFA, while only four of 22 functions operate within the Makana LFA. Participants also identified key affordances for the LFA such as reorientation as a community sports organisation. Discussion: Comparison between perspectives indicated four mismatches. 1) SAFA views the LFA as the foundation of the talent identification and development infrastructure of South African football. SMEs view it as a community centred organisation. 2) A lack of human capacity is evident at the community level of Makana football. 3) Funding and assets are absent at this grassroots level. 4) The LFA relies on other stakeholders, but these relationships are not formalised. Policymakers, therefore, have a lack of knowledge of the contextual challenges faced by LFA administrators. It is recommended that SAFA view the LFA as a community sport organisation, focusing on improving human capacity, increasing funding, and formalising stakeholder networks. Furthermore, conceptual models from CWA provide explicit socio-technical system redesign recommendations. Conclusion: Large mismatches between the organising body SAFA and the actual functioning of the LFA significantly hinder the effective management and running of football at a grassroots level in resource-scarce contexts in South Africa. The perspectives approach to CWA was useful in elucidating the constraints and affordances of the Makana LFA socio-technical system and informing redesign opportunities. Systems HFE methodology is therefore well placed to contribute to broader societal issues within resources scarce contexts such as football in Makana. Furthermore, the philosophical underpinnings of systems based HFE were successful in the development of sustainable participatory research within the South African grassroots football context."

A consensus definition is necessary to guide youth sport stakeholders on topics associated with sport specialization. Objective To develop a consensus definition of youth sport specialization and identify elements that support the construct of specialization. Design Delphi study. Setting Directed surveys. Patients or Other Participants A consensus panel of 17 experts was created to provide a broad multidisciplinary perspective on sport specialization in youth athletes. Data Collection and Analysis The final definition was developed per an iterative process that involved 4 rounds of review. A comprehensive review of the literature and expert input supported our initial proposed umbrella definition that included 6 additional elements. The study team reviewed the results after each round, and changes were made to the definition based on panel feedback. Main Outcome Measure(s) Panel members were provided with the definition and 6 elements and then asked to rate each specific to importance, relevance, and clarity using a 4-point Likert scale. Results In 4 Delphi consensus rounds, 17 experts reviewed the umbrella definition and 6 elements before consensus was reached. The umbrella definition and 3 of the initial 6 elements achieved greater than 80% agreement for importance, relevance, and clarity after the fourth round of review. The remaining 3 components did not reach greater than 80% agreement, even after iterative edits, and were removed. The process resulted in a final consensus definition: Sport specialization is intentional and focused participation in a single sport for a majority of the year that restricts opportunities for engagement in other sports and activities. Conclusions A consensus-based conceptual definition for sport specialization was developed using a Delphi method. This definition has important implications for clinicians and sports medicine professionals who support youth athletes."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the muscle activity of adductor longus and gracilis as well as hip and knee joint kinematics during $$90^{\circ }$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msup> <mml:mn>90</mml:mn> <mml:mo>∘</mml:mo> </mml:msup> </mml:math> -cutting and inside passing. Thirteen male soccer players were investigated with 3D-motion capturing and surface electromyography of adductor longus and gracilis while performing the two movements. Hip and knee joint kinematics were calculated with AnyBody Modelling System. Muscle activity of both muscles was significantly higher during the cutting manoeuvre compared to inside passing. Kinematics showed that the highest activity occurred during phases of fast muscle lengthening and eccentric contraction of the adductors which is known to increase the groin injury risk. Of both movements, cutting showed the higher activity and is therefore more likely to cause groin injuries. However, passing might also increase the risk for groin injuries as it is one of the most performed actions in soccer, and therefore most likely causes groin injuries through overuse. Practitioners need to be aware of these risks and should prepare players accordingly through strength and flexibility training."

Fortyfour Division I American football players participated in the study. Kinetic variables were collected from both dominant and non-dominant legs using two force plates. Normalized peak power, normalized net impulse, and normalized peak force significantly correlated with jump height (r = .960, r = .998, r = .725, respectively with p &lt; .05). The mean frequency component was significantly correlated with CMJ performance (r = .355 with p &lt; .05). The reliability of the frequency variables was higher than the time domain variables. Frequency domain variables showed weaker correlations with jump height compared with time domain variables. Frequency domain analysis provides frequency components, which represent the rate of energy transmission from the eccentric phase to the end of the push-off phase. Frequency component information may provide additional information for the analyses of CMJ performance for athletes."

Between-limb differences during 180° turns in female soccer players: application of statistical parametric mapping. J Strength Cond Res 36(11): 3136-3142, 2022-This study was exploratory in nature and investigated the ability of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to assess between-limb differences in lower-extremity movement change of direction. Fourteen female soccer players (mean ± SD ; age = 20.6 ± 0.6 years; height = 1.65 ± 0.07 m; and body mass = 56.04 ± 6.20 kg). For comparisons between preferred and nonpreferred limbs, vertical (Fz) and horizontal (Fx) ground reaction force were determined along with hip, knee, and ankle angles and moments in the sagittal plane during weight acceptance during the final contact. In addition, frontal plane knee abduction angles and moments were calculated during the final contact. Statistical parametric mapping software was then used to assess for differences between the entire weight acceptance phase of preferred and nonpreferred limbs. There were no differences between limbs in all variables using SPM. These results demonstrate that female soccer players exhibit little side-to-side differences in certain lower-limb biomechanics when performing a turn maneuver. These findings can be utilized by practitioners and clinicians when developing injury prevention and rehabilitation programs."

Engineering design of jumps could reduce injuries by limiting equivalent fall heights, which are proportional to dissipated landing impact energy. No evidence refutes making terrain park jumps safer in this way. We discuss case studies illustrating that large equivalent fall heights are significant factors in traumatic injuries on terrain park jumps. We argue that it is the ethical responsibility of engineers to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of the public when performing and presenting research on snowsport safety. Developing standards and adopting design tools for builders can make jumps safer. To reduce injuries, we introduce an online tool that can evaluate existing jumps as well as design jump profiles with safer equivalent fall heights."

The purpose of this study was to determine if gait biomechanics and daily physical activity (PA) associate with cartilage T2 relaxation times, a marker of collagen organization and water content, 1 month after ACL injury. Twenty‐seven participants (15–35 years old) without chondral lesions completed magnetic resonance imaging, three‐dimensional gait analysis, and 1 week of PA accelerometry. Interlimb differences and ratios were calculated for gait biomechanics and T2 relaxation times, respectively. Multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and concomitant meniscus injury were used to determine the association between gait biomechanics and PA with T2 relaxation times, respectively. Altered knee adduction moment (KAM) impulse, less knee flexion excursion (kEXC) and higher daily step counts accounted for 35.8%–65.8% of T2 relaxation time variation in the weightbearing and posterior cartilage of the medial and lateral compartment (all p ≤ .011). KAM impulse was the strongest factor for T2 relaxation times in all models (all p ≤ .001). Lower KAM impulse associated with longer T2 relaxation times in the injured medial compartment ( β = −.720 to −.901) and shorter T2 relaxation in the lateral compartment ( β = .713 to .956). At 1 month after ACL injury, altered KAM impulse, less kEXC, and higher PA associated with longer T2 relaxation times, which may indicate poorer cartilage health. Statement of Clinical Significance: Gait biomechanics and daily PA are modifiable targets that may improve cartilage health acutely after ACL injury and slow progression to OA."

In most patients it is caused by traumatic patella luxation or the existence of a range of predisposing anatomic risk factors leading to an unphysiological movement sequence within the PFJ also known as patellofemoral maltracking. In order to provide an individualized therapy approach, clinical and radiological evaluation of those risk factors of variable magnitude becomes essential. Diagnostic imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plain radiography, and computed tomography (CT) are straightforward diagnostic tools in terms of evaluation and treatment of PI. Method In this review we performed a precise analysis of today’s literature concerning the radiological evaluation of anatomic risk factors leading to PI. The purpose of the review is to present a logical compilation of the different anatomical risk factors causing PI and provide a straight overview of valuable radiological imaging techniques. Results and Conclusion PI is frequently based on a multifactorial disposition. The most relevant predisposing risk factors are trochlea dysplasia, rupture of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), patella alta, abnormal tibial tubercle to trochlea groove distance (TT-TG), femoral torsion deformities, and genu valgum. Although plain X-rays may provide basic diagnostic value, cross-sectional imaging (MRI, CT) is the standard radiological tool in terms of evaluation and detection of severity of predisposing anatomic variants leading to PI.

BTS G-WALK® gait analysis system was used to collect gait kinematic data of 87 subjects from an institute of physical education and sports science. &#x0D; The subjects were followed for a full academic season after which the researcher inquired about their injury occurrences. Binary logistic regression was used to develop a prediction model to predict lower limb injuries of sportspersons.&#x0D; Results. The result of the study revealed that increasing Range of Obliquity, Range of Tilt and Range of Rotation were associated with increased likelihood of future running-related lower limb injury. However, the lower Symmetry Index was associated with increase in the likelihood of future running-related lower limb injury.&#x0D; Conclusions. The study confirmed that it is possible to predict injury, but for practical implication further research is essential with a bigger sample size."

Long-term cares are suitable at home to avoid congestions within hospital facilities. There are different technologies available to improve such people's conditions in their daily life. The standing posture is the key solution to enhance people's wellness amid the psychological burden due to the almost impossibility to be completely healed. The paper proposes the use of a polyfunctional and robotic bed capable of displaying many positions namely vertical, tilting, anti-trendelenburg with necessary graduation. A three-year monitoring of a patient, using a polyfunctional and robotic bed, suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has been investigated. Different physiological parameters have been measured and, particularly, the variation of temperature has been measured in presence of body position connected to the robotic bed rotation that provokes biomechanical effort. It is demonstrated that certain body positions correspond to major and minor physical effort, hence major and minor oxygenation. An infrared camera has been used. As a positive result, the variation of posture has been delaying the increase of the pathological signs, because of better conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3185042611,The Effect Of Load On The Kinetics And Kinematics Of The Lower Extremity During Landing,2021-03-25,2021,dissertation,"Purpose: To understand the differences in the lower extremity kinetics and kinematics as load increases during jump landings. Methods: Ten male participants (20.4 years ± 2.41 years, 108.8kg ± 14.02kg) took part in two testing sessions. The first testing session involved testing each participant’s 1-repetition max in the hexagonal barbell deadlift. The second testing session involved the data collection of the jumping trials for each participant. Participants performed their countermovement jumps under seven randomized conditions. Six of the conditions involved the hex bar using loads equivalent to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% estimated 1-repetition max of the hexagonal barbell deadlift. The seventh condition was an unloaded (bodyweight or 0%) countermovement jump. Peak values for joint powers, moments, angles, and velocities were recorded for the ankle, knee, and hip for all participants and conditions. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences among results. Results: Significant differences (p < .05) were found in the joint powers and moments but no differences were found in any condition or joint for the peak angles or velocities. The greatest absolute values for both the peak powers and moments were found at the unloaded condition and decreased as load increased. Conclusion: This investigation has largely supported the previous research that has been done regarding loaded landings. The current findings support the previous notions that jump heights and joint velocity seem to have direct effect on joint moments and powers. Implications for injury risk and sports performance can also be drawn from these results, but more research would need to be done in order to fully understand loaded landings as they relate to either of those topics. Additionally, as the landscape of loaded landings is still quite shallow, any research regarding the effects to the lower extremity at landing with load would continue to create a more robust understanding of such an important aspect of jumping."

https://openalex.org/W4235985886,How is parkour new and singular? A narrative review across miscellaneous academic fields.,2021-03-25,2021,review,"Parkour is a growing sport that mostly involves jumping, vaulting over obstacles, and climbing in a non dedicated setting. The authors gathered all known relevant literature across miscellaneaous academic fields in order to define parkour with regards to other sports disciplines.Parkour is a lifestyle sport, and as such provides an alternative to mainstream ones, away from strict rules, standardized settings, and necessary competitions. Traceurs (parkour adepts) consider the city as a playground and as an outlet for their creativity, but they also have a strong taste for hard and individualized challenges. They usually train on non specific structures, at ground level. Although their social background is not clear, they are mostly young and male.Traceurs are stronger than recreational athletes, especially in eccentric exercises. However, their endurance skills may be below average. One of the core specificities of parkour is its precision constraint at landing, which turns a standing long jump into a precision jump, regulated on-line so as to prepare for landing. The running precision jump follows the same landing pattern, and its flight phase contrasts with long jump techniques. Injuries, which are not more frequent than in other sports, often occur at reception and on lower limb extremities. This risk is coped with targeting the landing area with the forefoot instead of letting the heel hit the ground like in gymnastics, or with rolling in order to dissipate the impact. Overall, parkour focuses on adaptability to new environments, which leads to specific techniques that have not yet been extensively addressed by the literature."

https://openalex.org/W3136483606,How Does a Sport Psychological Intervention Help Professional Cyclists to Cope With Their Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown?,2021-03-23,2021,article,"All around the world in March, due to COVID-19, competitive sport calendars were suddenly canceled, jeopardizing the training programs of athletes. Moreover, in Italy, the government banned all non-essential travel across the entire country from the beginning of March. Consequently, Italian cyclists were banned from leaving their homes and therefore unable to perform their ordinary training activities. The Italian Association of Professional Cyclists (ACCPI) early on during that period noticed that several cyclists were experiencing a worrying decrease in their mental well-being and asked the authors to set up an online Sport Psychology Intervention (SPI) during lockdown to enhance the athletes' mental health. Through a number of unprecedented events and considerations, the aim of the current investigation was to assess the Italian cyclists' mental health during the lockdown and its changes after the SPI. We validated the Italian version of the Sport Mental Health Continuum Short Form (Sport MHC-SF)—presented in Study 1—and then applied it to a sample of Italian professional cyclists—presented in Study 2—prior to and after the SPI. To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the Sport MHC-SF were tested in Study 1. RM-MANOVA tests were run to evaluate the effect of SPI on cyclists in Study 2. A total of 185 Italian athletes were involved in the validation of the MHC in Study 1 and 38 professional cyclists in Study 2. Results from Study 1 suggested a three-factor higher order model of Sport MHC-SF [Model fit: χ 2 (df) = 471.252 (252), p &amp;lt; 0.000; CFI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.049; RMR= 0.048]. MCFA showed that the default model kept invariance among groups of athletes (i.e., female, male, individual, and team sports). Results from Study 2 highlighted that professional cyclists who followed the SPI were able to cope better with psychological stressors, showing improved well-being compared to the athletes that did not. No significant differences were found for emotional and social well-being. The present multi-study paper contributes to the theoretical field with a validated measure of Sport MHC-SF translated in the Italian language and culture. It also provides practical implications related to cases of reduced mental health due to injury, illness, or similar situations of home confinement in the future."

Twenty-four amateur basketball players (12 males and females) completed two identical sessions which consisted of four unilateral SBJs (two with each leg) and two bilateral SBJs. Mean and peak values of force, velocity and power, and impulse were obtained separately for each leg using a dual force platform. Inter-limb asymmetries were computed using the standard percentage difference for the unilateral SBJ, and the bilateral asymmetry index-1 for the bilateral SBJ. All performance variables generally presented an acceptable absolute reliability for both SBJs (CV range = 3.65-9.81%) with some exceptions for mean force, mean power, and peak power obtained with both legs (CV range = 10.00-15.46%). Three out of 14 variables were obtained with higher reliability during the unilateral SBJ (CVratio ≥ 1.18), and 5 out of 14 during the bilateral SBJ (CVratio ≥ 1.27). Asymmetry variables always showed unacceptable reliability (ICCrange = -0.40 to 0.58), and slight to fair levels of agreement in their direction (Kappa range = -0.12 to 0.40) except for unilateral SBJ peak velocity [Kappa = 0.52] and bilateral SBJ peak power [Kappa = 0.51]) that showed moderate agreement for both SBJs. These results highlight that single-leg performance variables can be generally obtained with acceptable reliability regardless of the SBJ variant, but the reliability of the inter-limb asymmetries in the conditions examined in the present study is unacceptable to track individual changes in performance."

The purpose of this study was to assess differences in joint-level biomechanics related to jumping and cutting performance and potential injury risk mechanisms, between different shoe upper configurations. NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes (n = 31) recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four agility-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump Repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump Repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step Drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior Drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Panel. Ankle, knee and hip range of motion and peak joint moments in the sagittal, frontal and transverse planes, as well as peak joint powers, were calculated for CMJ and LSJ movements. Alternative fit configurations led to increased ankle plantarflexion and knee extension joint moments. Further, frontal and transverse plane ranges of motion at the ankle, knee and hip were reduced with at least one alternative fit configuration. These findings help to explain improved agility performance with upper configurations designed to better fit the shape of the foot and suggest improved lower limb alignment which may help to prevent musculoskeletal injury."

The basal ceratopsian Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis is known from thousands of specimens from the Lower Cretaceous of China and these include many so‐called ‘juvenile clusters.’ During the early stages of ontogeny, P. lujiatunensis underwent a posture shift from quadrupedal to bipedal, and a dietary shift has also been postulated. In this study, we made a 2D mechanical analysis of the jaws of a hatchling and an adult to determine the differences between the two systems; we found some differences, but these were only modest. The adult was better suited to feeding on tough plant material than the hatchling, based on its higher values of absolute and relative bite forces and higher values of mechanical advantage, but there were no substantial shifts in jaw shape or function."

This type of shoe could improve the muscle function of the lower limb and prevent injury risks in dynamic situations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate differences in lower-limb kinetics and kinematics based on single-leg landing (SLL) using normal shoes (NS) and bionic shoes (BS). The study used 15 male subject volunteers (age 23.4 ± 1.14 years, height 177.6 ± 4.83cm, body weight (BW) 73.6 ± 7.02 kg). To ensure the subject standardization of the participants, there were several inclusion criteria used for selection. There were two kinds of experimental shoes used in the landing experiment to detect the change of lower limbs when a landing task was performed. Kinetics and kinematic data were collected during an SLL task, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was used to evaluate the differences between NS and BS. We found that the flexion and extension angles of the knee (p = 0.004) and hip (p = 0.046, p = 0.018) joints, and the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of ankle (p = 0.031) moment were significantly different in the sagittal planes. In the frontal plane, the eversion and inversion of the ankle (p = 0.016), and the abduction and adduction of knee (p = 0.017, p = 0.007) angle were found significant differences. In the horizontal plane, the external and internal rotation of hip (p = 0.036) and knee (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.029) moment were found significant differences, and knee angle (p = 0.043) also. According to our results, we conclude that using BS can cause bigger knee and hip flexion than NS. Also, this finding indicates that BS might be considered to reduce lower-limb injury risk during the SLL phase."

This study investigated the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) and shoe with an unstable surface training on balance, functional performance, strength, joint position sense in people with CAI. Method Thirty- four peoples with unilateral CAI were randomly assigned to three groups: WBV group, WBV with shoe with an unstable surface (WBV-S), and no treatment control group (CON). The WBV group received 4 weeks progressive WBV training and the WBV-S group received progressive WBV training with shoe with an unstable surface. Modified star excursion balance test (mSEBT)reach distance, Hop-Test, muscle strength, and joint position sense were measured at baseline and after the 4 weeks; Moreover, the mSEBT and Hop-Test were reassessed again 2 weeks post intervention. Results The result showed a significant group-by-time interaction for anterior and posterolateral directions of mSEBT. The reach distance of these directions at post-intervention and follow-up increased significantly compare to pre-intervention in the WBV and WBV-S groups but not significantly change in the CON group. The Hop test in the WBV-S group was significantly more at post-intervention and follow-up compared to pre-intervention. However, no significant changes were observed in WBV and CON groups. No significant changes were observed for mSEBT posteromedial direction, muscles strength, and joint position sense errors. Conclusion The 4 weeks WBV and WBV-S interventions could improve balance in peoples with CAI. Improvement in Hop test was only observed in the WBV-S group suggesting the added value of combining WBV and shoe with an unstable surface as an effective therapy compared to WBV training alone. The use of WBV and WBV-S were not associated with significant changes in strength and joint position sense variables over a four-week period.

Potentiometers have been identified as one possible sensor type for continuous monitoring of knee motion. However, to verify their use in monitoring real-life environments, further research is needed. We aimed to validate a potentiometer-embedded knee brace to measure sagittal knee kinematics during various daily activities, as well as to assess its potential to continuously monitor knee motion. To this end, the sagittal knee motion of 32 healthy subjects was recorded simultaneously by an instrumented knee brace and an optoelectronic reference system during activities of daily living to assess the agreement between these two measurement systems. To evaluate the potentiometer’s behavior during continuous monitoring, knee motion was continuously recorded in a subgroup (n = 9) who wore the knee brace over the course of a day. Our results show a strong agreement between the instrumented knee brace and reference system across all investigated activities as well as stable sensor behavior during continuous tracking. The presented potentiometer-based sensor system demonstrates strong potential as a device for measuring sagittal knee motion during daily activities as well as for continuous knee motion monitoring."

We additionally aimed to explain changes in fitness levels during the in-season through regression models, considering accumulated load, baseline levels, and peak height velocity (PHV) as predictors. Twenty-three male sub-elite soccer players aged 15.5 ± 0.2 years (PHV: 13.6 ± 0.4 years; body height: 172.7 ± 4.2 cm; body mass: 61.3 ± 5.6 kg; body fat: 13.7% ± 3.9%; VO 2m ax : 48.4 ± 2.6 mL⋅kg –1 ⋅min –1 ), were tested three times across the season (i.e., early-season (EaS), mid-season (MiS), and end-season (EnS) for VO 2m ax , HR max , LSM, and LSS. Aerobic and speed variables gradually improved over the season and had a strong association with PHV. Moreover, the HR max demonstrated improvements from EaS to EnS; however, this was more evident in the intermediate period (from EaS to MiS) and had a strong association with VO 2m ax . Regression analysis showed significant predictions for VO 2m ax [ F ( 2, 20) = 8.18, p ≤ 0.001] with an R 2 of 0.45. In conclusion, the meaningful variation of youth players’ fitness levels can be observed across the season, and such changes can be partially explained by the load imposed."

At each match, the athletes used a Global Positioning System (GPS) device to collect performance data. Forty-eight hours after each match, every athlete’s perception of recovery, fatigue, and pain was documented. Blood was collected for creatine kinase (CK) analysis, and infrared thermography was applied. Only athletes who presented pain above 4 in either limb were included for thermographic analysis. Each thermographic image was divided into 14 regions of interest. For statistical analysis, we included only the images that showed differences ≥ 1° C. Data normality was verified by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Dallal-Wilkinson-Lilliefors correction. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient to verify the correlation between infrared thermography and the biochemical marker, performance data, and clinical recovery scales. No correlation was observed between mean skin temperature and blood CK levels, pain level, perception of recovery, and fatigue perception (r &lt;0.2, p&gt;0.05). Thus, infrared thermography did not correlate with CK level, pain, fatigue perception, or recovery, nor with performance variables within the field."
https://openalex.org/W3138054632,Concussion History and Balance Performance in Adolescent Rugby Union Players,2021-03-17,2021,article,"Background: Sports-related concussion is a worldwide problem. There is a concern that an initial concussion can cause prolonged subclinical disturbances to sensorimotor function that increase the risk of subsequent injury. The primary aim of this study was to examine whether a history of sports-related concussion has effects on static and dynamic balance performance in adolescent rugby players. Hypothesis: Dynamic balance would be worse in players with a history of concussion compared with those with no history of concussion. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Male adolescent rugby players aged 14 to 18 years from 5 schools were recruited before the start of the 2018-2019 playing season. Participants completed questionnaires and physical tests, including dynamic Y balance and single-leg static balance (eyes closed) tests, while performing single and dual tasks. Dynamic balance was assessed using inertial sensor instrumentation. Dependent variables were normalized reach distance and the sample entropy (SEn) of the 3 axes ( x, y, and z). Results: Of the 195 participants, 100 reported a history of concussion. Those with a history of concussion demonstrated higher SEn in all directions, with highest values during anterior (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.7; P = .027) and posteromedial (SMD, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .004) reach directions compared with those with no history. There was no difference between groups (concussion history vs control) in traditional Y balance reach distances in the anterior or posteromedial directions or single-leg static balance during both single- ( P = .47) and dual-task ( P = .67) conditions. Conclusion: Adolescent rugby union athletes with a history of concussion had poorer dynamic balance during performance tasks compared with healthy controls. Static single-leg balance tests, either single or dual task, may not be sensitive enough to detect sensorimotor deficits in those with a history of concussion."

The aim of this study was to follow trends in concussion knowledge of parents from one community following implementation of Michigan’s Sports Concussion Laws (MSCL). Methods: Parents of students from a suburban school district were surveyed via district email at 1 year and 5 years post-implementation of MSCL. Results were compared to a survey obtained prior to the law. Individual questions were compared between the three surveys by Chi-square analysis with significance at p&lt;0.05. Results: A total of 381 responses were obtained in the 1-year post-MSCL (1yMSCL) and 178 in the 5 year post-MSCL (5yMSCL) survey. Awareness of district policy regarding concussion was much higher after implementation of the law (77% at 1yMSCL and 71% at 5yMSCL) compared to prior (18% pre-MSCL, p&lt;0.0001). As the law matured, parental knowledge improved. Respondents to the 5yMSCL survey were more aware of medical guidelines surrounding “return to play” after SRC compared to 1yMSCL (84.8% v 78.7%, p=0.01). At 5yMSCL, more respondents agreed that head injury can cause more brain damage to children than adults (86.5% v 78.7% at 1yMSCL, p=0.03). Lastly, parents continued to rate the concussion educational material as the most helpful information source on SRC. Conclusion: Since implementation of MSCL, parental knowledge increased in awareness of medical guidelines for SRC and potential brain damage risks to children. This increase may be in part from maturation of policy changes from MSCL."

These data were used in a combined neuromusculoskeletal and ACL force model to determine lower limb muscle and ACL forces.Peak ACL force (2.3 ± 0.5 bodyweight) was observed at ~14% of stance during the drop-land-lateral jump. The ACL force was primarily generated through the sagittal plane, and muscle was the dominant source of ACL loading. The main ACL antagonists (i.e., loaders) were the gastrocnemii and quadriceps, whereas the hamstrings were the main ACL agonists (i.e., supporters).Combining neuromusculoskeletal and ACL force models, the roles of muscle in ACL loading and support were determined during a challenging motor task. Results highlighted the importance of the gastrocnemius in ACL loading, which could be considered more prominently in ACL injury prevention and rehabilitation programs."

Twenty-one participants (age: 18.7 ± 0.6 years) performed three sessions of three GPBT formats, which were matched for training volume but structured with different high-speed running and sprint demands: i) performed along linear paths (GPBT-L); ii) performed as repetitive actions of short distance including many multi-directional changes of direction (GPBT-S) and, iii) a combination of the other two protocols, that is linear high-speed runs and sprint efforts with a single change of direction (GPBT-M). External load outputs were collected using GPS units, physiological and perceptual responses were monitored with heart rate (HR) monitors, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), respectively. While no differences were found between formats for HR and RPE, distinct external load profiles were observed for high-speed running (HSD) and sprint distances (SD), (GPBT-L > GPBT-M > GBPT-S, all p < 0.05), and high-intensity acceleration and deceleration efforts (HIE), (GPBT-S > GPBT-M > GPBT-L, all p < 0.05). Moreover, the GPBT-S format was characterized by greater intra-session variability for HSD, SD, and HIE (CV% = 24.2%, 16.5% and 20.4%, respectively) and inter-session variability for HSD and SD (CV% = 10% and 15.7%, respectively) compared to the other two formats. Considering their load profiles and the associated reliability scores, football practitioners can implement GPBT formats interchangeably to elicit necessary internal load responses and selectively to prioritize specific external load outputs."

However, it is not known to what extent recovery practices are being adapted by practitioners following ET and where gaps exist between research and practice. Therefore, this study explored soccer practitioner perceptions of recovery practices following ET matches. A total of 72 practitioners from across different levels of soccer and several countries completed a bespoke online survey. Inductive content analysis of the responses identified five higher-order themes: 'conditioning', 'player monitoring', 'recovery practices', 'training', and 'future research directions'. Mixed responses were received in relation to whether practitioners condition players in preparation for ET, though 72% allowed players to return to training based on fatigue markers following this additional 30-min period. Sixty-three (88%) practitioners believed that ET delays the time-course of recovery, with 82% highlighting that practices should be adapted following ET compared with a typical 90-min match. Forty-nine practitioners (68%) reduce training loads and intensities for up to 48 hr post ET matches, though training mostly recommences as 'normal' at 72 hr. Sixty-three (88%) practitioners believed that more research should be conducted on recovery following ET, with 'tracking players physiological and physical responses', 'nutritional interventions to accelerate recovery' and 'changes in acute injury-risk' being the three areas of research that practitioners ranked as most important. These data suggest practitioners and coaches adjust recovery practices following ET matches compared to 90 min. Further research on the efficacy of recovery strategies following ET matches is required to inform applied practice."

Little evidence advocates the most beneficial recovery strategies including contemporary cooling applications. The aim of the study was to examine immediate effects of the Game Ready® on physiological and biomechanical measures in a population of elite male academy footballers, following a fatiguing training session mid-competitive season. Twenty, elite male footballers took part (180.2 ± 8.7cm, 75.0 ± 11.4kg, 18 ± 0.5years). Following a normal fatiguing training session, players were randomly assigned to receive either cryotherapy (Game Ready®) (20-minutes at medium compression (5-55 mm Hg)) or passive recovery (PAS). Data was collected at match-day+1, immediately post-training and immediately post-intervention. Performance measures included countermovement jump (CMJ), isometric adductor strength (IAS), hamstring flexibility (HF), and skin surface temperature (Tsk). Significant main effects for group for CMJ data following exposure to cooling were displayed (p = < 0.05). Individual group analysis displayed a significant reduction in CMJ performance in the group exposed to cryotherapy (p = < 0.05) immediately post, but not for PAS. No main effects were identified for cryotherapy or PAS group for IAS or HF (p = > 0.05). Tsk reduced significantly (p = < 0.05) in the cryotherapy group, meeting therapeutic Tsk range. Reductions in performance immediately following exposure to pneumatic cryo-compressive devices may negate the justification of this recovery strategy if neuromuscular mechanisms are required in immediate short term. Application of such recovery strategies however are dependent on the type of recovery demand and should be adapted individually to suit the needs of the athlete to optimise readiness to train/play."

In Experiment 1, participants tried to hit a circular target with a stylus movement under restricted feedback conditions. We measured the perception of target size during action planning and observed larger estimates for larger movement distances. In Experiment 2, we then tested the hypothesis that this action specific influence on perception is due to changes in the allocation of spatial attention. For this purpose, we replaced the hitting task by conditions of focused and distributed attention and measured the perception of the former target stimulus. The results revealed changes in the perceived stimulus size very similar to those observed in Experiment 1. These results indicate that action’s effects on perception root in changes of spatial attention."

The potentiation approaches described here include warming up, testing and monitoring, re-warm-up and priming strategies, and complex training. The post-activation performance enhancement responses can be best described following the new taxonomy, which allows the identification of the best strategies in every specific sport setting. This requires identifying the post-activation performance enhancement factors, which are the conditioning activity, the verification test, the population of athletes; and potential moderators (i.e. exercise type and loading, timing; recovery interval, target exercise, performance parameter; training background, age, and sex). The inherent limitations to these approaches, including the gaps in literature requiring further studies, may be overcome in practice by using individualized approaches."

To design in a failure feature, utilising a safety notch, which would stop excessive stress, σ, permeating the bone causing damage to the user. To achieve this, the topology of the ITAP was studied using MATLAB and ANSYS models with a wide range of component volumes. The topology analysis identified critical materials and local maximum stresses when modelling the applied loads. This together with additive layer manufacture allows for bespoke prosthetics that can improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to design a fully functional, failure feature that is operational when extreme loads are applied from any direction. Physical testing is needed for validation of this study. Further research is also recommended on the design so that the σ within the ITAP is less than the yield stress, σs, of bone when other loads are applied from running and other activities."

To date, ACL injury prevention and management has been approached from a sex-based biological point of view which has furthered our understanding of injury risk factors, mechanisms, and prevention and rehabilitation programmes. However, the traditional sex-based approach does not take into account the growing recognition of how sex and gender (a social construct) are ‘entangled’ and influence each other. Objective This paper discusses the curious absence of gender as an influencer in the dialogue surrounding ACL injuries. We propose adding gender as a pervasive developmental environment as a new theoretical overlay to an established injury model to illustrate how gender can operate as an extrinsic determinant from the presport, training and competition environments through to ACL injury and the treatment environment. Approach We draw on social epidemiological theories of the embodiment of gender and health to provide plausible examples of how gender may influence ACL injury, and demonstrate the opportunity for new, interdisciplinary research in the field. Conclusion Over 20 years of research has failed to decrease the ACL injury rate disparity between girls/women and boys/men. Embedding gender in the study of ACL injury will heighten awareness of possible influences outside the traditional biological elements, challenge us to think about the inextricable ‘entanglement’ of sex and gender, and inform more effective approaches to ACL injury prevention and treatment."

Evidence from the data of 5 consecutive seasons of the German Bundesliga,2021-03-09,2021,article,"The study aimed to identify the effects of situational (match location, match outcome and strength of team/opponent team) and environmental (ambient temperature, relative humidity, WBGT, ground and weather condition) factors on the physical and technical activity of elite football on individual playing positions. Physical and technical activity were collected from 779 football players competing in the German Bundesliga during 5 domestic seasons, from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019, totalling 1530 matches. The data on players' physical and technical activity was taken from the IMPIRE AG system. Based on the available data, 11 variables were selected to quantify the match activity profiles of players. The results showed that situational variables had major effects on the technical performance (especially number of passes performed) but minor effects on physical performance. In turn, among the analysed environmental factors, temperature is the most sensitive, which affects the Total Distance and Sprint Efforts of players in all five positions. This investigation demonstrated that, given that passing is a key technical activity in modern football, players and training staff should be particularly aware that passing maybe affected by situational variables. Professional players are able to react and adapt to various environmental conditions, modifying physical activity depending on the needs in German Bundesliga. These results could help coaches and analysts to better understand the influences of situational and environmental variables on individual playing positions during the evaluation of players' physical and technical performance."

The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between the force measured at the ankle hook and the hamstring force estimated by a low extremity model. Thirteen male college sprinters were recruited to perform NHE on an instrumented device Nordbord (Vald Performance, Australia). Contact forces were measured at a sampling rate of 50 Hz at the hooks using the uniaxial load cells. 3D kinematics were measured simultaneously at a sampling rate of 200 Hz using a 16-camera motion analysis system (Vicon Motion Analysis, Oxford, United Kingdom) during the NHE. The data were processed with Visual 3D (C-Motion, Germantown, MD, United States) and OpenSim (NCSRR, Stanford, CA, United States) to calculate the knee joint center’s coordinates and hamstring moment arms during NHE. A static low extremity model was built to estimate the hamstring force during NHE. We have observed a significant but not very high correlation ( r 2 = 0.58) between peak hamstring force and the peak contact force at the ankle hook. The peak contact force measured at the ankle hook can only explain a little more than half of the variations in peak hamstring muscle forces during NHE. Caution must be exercised when assessing the eccentric hamstring strength using the ankle contact force during NHE."

However, for this to be realised, such approaches must first undergo a thorough quantitative evaluation against experimental data. We developed a musculoskeletal modelling and simulation framework for sprinting, with the objective to evaluate its ability to reproduce experimental kinematics and kinetics data for different sprinting phases. This was achieved by performing a series of data-tracking calibration (individual and simultaneous) and validation simulations, that also featured the generation of dynamically consistent simulated outputs and the determination of foot-ground contact model parameters. The simulated values from the calibration simulations were found to be in close agreement with the corresponding experimental data, particularly for the kinematics (average root mean squared differences (RMSDs) less than 1.0° and 0.2 cm for the rotational and translational kinematics, respectively) and ground reaction force (highest average percentage RMSD of 8.1%). Minimal differences in tracking performance were observed when concurrently determining the foot-ground contact model parameters from each of the individual or simultaneous calibration simulations. The validation simulation yielded results that were comparable (RMSDs less than 1.0° and 0.3 cm for the rotational and translational kinematics, respectively) to those obtained from the calibration simulations. This study demonstrated the suitability of the proposed framework for performing future predictive simulations of sprinting, and gives confidence in its use to assess the cause-effect relationships of technique modification in relation to performance. Furthermore, this is the first study to provide dynamically consistent three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations of sprinting across different phases."

A cross-sectional study, including a self-reported running questionnaire completed after the first outdoor running session after quarantine, was performed. Three hundred recreational runners (74% males; 60% 18–40 years old; most typical running experience &gt;3 years, 10–30 km weekly running distance distributed in 3–4 sessions) were considered for analysis. Advanced runners ran, at least, 4 days/week and participated in running events. They performed significantly longer and more non-supervised weekly training sessions during confinement (p &lt; 0.01 for both) than novice and amateur runners. Most runners performed their first outdoor running session on asphalt (65.3%) and ran 5 to 10 km (61%) at a pace above 5 min/km (60%), reporting no pain before (77%), during (64%), and 24 h after (76%) the session.

Ankle, knee, hip, pelvis, and trunk angles in all planes of motion were collected during the first 100 ms after initial contact using a 3-dimensional infrared system. Precontact foot-ground angles were also extracted. Data from hypermobile and nonhypermobile groups were compared using multiple regression models with sex as a confounder. When nonsignificant, the confounder was removed from the model. Effect sizes (Hedge g) were calculated in the presence of significant between-group differences.Hypermobile individuals presented with lower minimum knee valgus angles with a mean difference of 3.5° (P = 0.03, Hedge g = 0.69) and greater peak knee external rotation angles with a mean difference of -4.5° (P = 0.04, Hedge g = 0.70) during dominant leg cutting, and lower peak ankle plantarflexion angles with a mean difference of 4.5° (P = 0.03, Hedge g = 0.73) during nondominant leg cutting compared with nonhypermobile individuals.Based on current scientific evidence, however, the identified differences are not crucial biomechanical injury risk factors that could predispose asymptomatic hypermobile individuals to noncontact knee or ACL injuries.Further research is needed to highlight differences between hypermobility groups. Knowledge of the differences between these groups may change the physical activity recommendations, prevention of injury, and rehabilitation approaches."

The extent to which marker location or constraining degrees of freedom (DOF) in the biomechanical model impacts on this integrity lacks consensus. Ten elite academy footballers performed bilateral overhead squats using a marker-based motion capture system. Kinematic data were calculated using four different marker sets with 3DOF and 6DOF configurations for the three joint rotations of the right knee. Root mean squared error differences between marker sets ranged in the sagittal plane between 1.02 and 4.19 degrees to larger values in the frontal (1.30-6.39 degrees) and transverse planes (1.33 and 7.97 degrees). The cross-correlation function of the knee kinematic time series for all eight marker-sets ranged from excellent for sagittal plane motion (>0.99) but reduced for both coronal and transverse planes (<0.9). Two-way ANOVA repeated measures calculated at peak knee flexion revealed significant differences between marker sets for frontal and transverse planes (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between some marker sets.

Results : Values (right and left; mean [SD]) were as follows: THD, 508.5 (71.8) %LL and 510.9 (56.7) %LL; SHD, 183.4 (24.6) %LL and 183.0 (21.5) %LL; and VH, 21.3 (5.2) %LL and 20.6 (5.0) %LL. All correlations were significant ( P ≤ .05), r / r 2 values (right and left) were THD–SHD, .91/.83 and .87/.76; THD–VH, .59/.35 and .51/.26; and SHD–VH, .50/.25 and .37/.17. A very large proportion of variance (76%–83%) was shared between the THD and SHD. A small proportion of variance was shared between the THD and VH (25%–35%) and SHD and VH (17%–25%). Conclusion : The THD and SHD capture highly similar aspects of lower-limb motor performance. In contrast, the VH captures aspects of lower-limb motor performance different to the THD or SHD. Either the THD or the SHD can be chosen for use within netball knee injury prevention screening protocols according to which is reasoned as most appropriate at a specific point in time. The VH, however, should be employed consistently alongside rather than in place of the THD or SHD."

This digitisation inevitably involves rendering many dimensions of students' bodies, activities and practices into digital data formats across learning areas: including health and physical education (HPE). These data can be used by schools and third parties to conduct surveillance of students' bodies and learning. This article draws on findings from a project involving interviews with HPE teachers in a diverse array of schools located in eastern Australia about the ways they were using digital technologies for pedagogical purposes. The interviews included questions concerning to what extent the teachers were aware of personal data security and privacy issues related to their students. While the use of datafication technologies such as apps and wearable devices for HPE teaching was common among our participants, for the most part, these teachers were not considering issues such as who could gain access to students' personal information and how these data might be breached or exploited by third parties. These findings are discussed within the broader contexts of young people's personal data privacy rights and schools' role in protecting students' information."

In 2020, this became even more apparent for many athletes, their support teams and their sport organisations, when their professional and social worlds became cyber-dominated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges were encountered by: (i) the athletes, in their efforts to remain active and well during this time when all competitions were cancelled and (ii) the healthcare professionals, working with these athletes, in their efforts to continue to support the athletes, when severe travel restrictions and social distancing were in place for considerable periods of time. The purpose of this paper, using a narrative review process, is to present and scrutinise an array of Internet interventions, remote psychological supports and applications (apps) that the athletes and their support personnel used to help them meet their physical, social, and emotional needs during the pandemic. The beneficial and restrictive features of these online options will be presented. Two main themes will be considered in order to focus this discussion, namely, (i) the potential physical and mental opportunities and challenges using the online world extensively during this time presented for the individuals working in sport and (ii) suggestions for how such online interventions used by the athletes, their coaches and sport science personnel during the pandemic may be maintained in some positive ways into the future, to help the athletes prepare for their upcoming competitions, their training and their future careers when they retire from elite sport."

These injuries commonly affect the ligaments but can also affect the associated soft tissue structures like the eversion muscles and tendons. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of such injuries is warranted so as to ensure early return to play and prevent long-term complications. Lateral ankle sprain injuries in sports may not always be associated with ligament injuries. We report a never before reported case of lateral ankle sprain injury in a soccer player with the unusual finding of isolated partial tear of Extensor digitorum longus muscle and its fascia leading to myo-fascial herniation. The lateral ankle ligaments were intact. The diagnosis was clinched on a high-frequency ultrasound scan supported by dynamic maneuvers which in fact proved to be superior to MRI as the latter failed to demonstrate the myo-fascial herniation in our case. We therefore propose that real-time ultrasound scanning with dynamic maneuvers should be the first line of investigation to assess sports injuries in anatomically complex joints like the ankle.

https://openalex.org/W3135241426,Nonlinear Pedagogy and its implications for practice in the Singapore PE context,2021-03-02,2021,article,"Background Nonlinear Pedagogy, underpinned by concepts in ecological dynamics, is a pedagogical framework that advocates an exploratory approach to acquisition of movement skills with an emphasis on individualised movement solutions. Its key principles have been successfully implemented in sports teaching and coaching and are currently being applied to learning designs in PE programmes.Purposes The purposes of the paper are to provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP) for Physical Education (PE). To exemplify applications of key concepts, we discuss how NLP is being implemented as a methodological framework for learning design in PE programmes of Singapore schools. For simplicity, our analysis focuses on the 'What', 'Why' and 'How' of NLP to illustrate its application in Singapore PE programmes.Discussion Understanding the 'What' and 'Why' of NLP can provide a sound foundation to understand how this pedagogical framework can be applied in formalised school PE settings. While it is important for teachers to know what NLP is, the 'Why' of NLP, referencing its effectiveness as a pedagogical approach, can provide a rationale for its adoption to enhance teaching and learning. The 'How' of NLP's practical implementation in Singapore schools is of primary interest for teachers, managers, administrators and policy makers in education.Conclusion The article discusses key pedagogical principles from NLP, which can provide a platform for teachers to design effective lessons and practices to enhance learning in PE programmes. An important practical implication of the current paper is to provide educators with guidance and training for incorporating pedagogical principles of NLP in lessons and learning programmes to enhance 'nonlinearization' of some current practices."

During the game players perform frequent landing, cutting and pivoting manoeuvres that expose them to substantial risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Recent years have seen the introduction of a professional women's league that has resulted in an exponential growth in the participation of women and girls in this sport. Unfortunately, there is a corresponding growth in ACL injury rates in female players. This review summarizes the incidence of ACL injury in both men's and women's Australian Rules football and reviews potential causative factors and risk reduction strategies. The final section takes an in depth look at return to sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery in these populations. Whilst an ACL injury does not mean the end of a player's career in Australian football, it certainly presents a significant challenge in terms of return to preinjury levels of form and high rates of secondary and tertiary ACL injury are also a significant concern.

Many elite players involved in high-impact activities develop patellar tendinopathy (PT) symptoms. Of them, a small percentage will develop refractory PT and need to undergo surgery. In some of these patients, surgery does not resolve these symptoms.To report the clinical results in a cohort of athletes who underwent further surgery after failure of primary surgery for PT.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.A total of 22 athletes who had undergone revision surgery for failed surgical management of PT were enrolled in the present study. Symptom severity was assessed through the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Scale for Patellar Tendinopathy (VISA-P) upon admission and at the final follow-up. Time to return to training, time to return to competition, and complications were also recorded.The mean age of the athletes was 25.4 years, and the mean symptom duration from the index intervention was 15.3 months. At a mean follow-up of 30.0 ± 4.9 months, the VISA-P score improved 27.8 points (P < .0001). The patients returned to training within a mean of 9.2 months. Fifteen patients (68.2%) returned to competition within a mean of 11.6 months. Of these 15 patients, a further 2 had decreased their performance, and 2 more had abandoned sports participation by the final follow-up. The overall rate of complications was 18.2%. One patient (4.5%) had a further revision procedure.Revision surgery was feasible and effective in patients in whom PT symptoms persisted after previous surgery for PT, achieving a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement of the VISA-P score as well as an acceptable rate of return to sport at a follow-up of 30 months."

A soccer player with good ball control is the one who is able to perform complex coordinated situational motor actions in a certain space and in as short time period as possible. The analysis included variations in the angle of the knee joint of the leg receiving a ball (AKLR), angle of the knee joint of the supporting leg (AKLS), angle between thighs (ABT), trunk bending angle (TBA), hip joint point height (HPH), and ball distance after controlling the ball (BDAC) between effective and ineffective passing in soccer. Material and Methods. A total of 12 university soccer players (age: 20.8 ± .83 years old, experience: 4.7 ±.78 years) voluntarily participated in the study. The players made five attempts to control the ball with the inside foot. The best attempt was analysed for each case (effective and ineffective). Results. The degrees of AKLR, AKLS, ABT, TBA and HPH were significantly greater in effective passing than those in ineffective passing; the observed effect sizes were 4.87, 2.53, 1.77, 3.98, and 3.40, respectively. BDAC was meaningfully greater at ineffective passing (effect size: 2.03). Conclusions. There were significant differences in the values of kinematic variables used to test ball control by effective and ineffective passes (p &lt; 0.05). The research sample, in terms of the values of kinematic variables, achieved noticeable progress during the performance of ball control for effective passing, which showed its effectiveness in reducing the distance after controlling the ball."

https://openalex.org/W3044918794,STORYTELLING IN VR: HELPING CHILDREN WITH FEAR OF THE DARK,2021-03-01,2021,article,"Though using virtual reality (VR) as a substitute for exposition therapy in phobia treatments has become more popular in recent times, many of these VR-based treatments require the assistance of a psychologist or a therapist. Furthermore, the majority of VR therapy is targeted at socially-based phobias or anxiety disorders. Fear of the dark is one of the most common fears in children and can develop into a diagnosed phobia in their later lives, but has yet to be prevented or treated with VR therapy programs. A measure to help children overcome their fears in a safe environment together with their care-takers could help improve familial relationships and ease the stress that this kind of phobia introduces in home life. This article presents the game design of one such VR prototype and discusses its potential as a therapeutic instrument for children with phobia of the dark.Fear of the dark is one of the most common fears in children and is thought to be a normal part of their development; however, a child’s fear of the dark can develop into a diag-nosed phobia in their later lives. 84.7% of children between 7 and 9 years of age suffer from mild nighttime fears. The fear of the dark can have a debilitating effect on a person’s life – or, if a child is affected, their caretakers’ lives also – as it inhibits leaving the house after dark, sleeping with a nightlight on, and suffering night terrors.This article will thus approach five topics: (1) the theoretical background of this study, which includes the following themes: virtual reality, gaming, and phobia; (2) related work; (3) method; and (4) functional design, being that the fifth (5) and final section of this paper concerns its conclusion.A working functional prototype was developed and consisted of a serious game adventure for a young childreen (between 7 and 9 years old). A case study was conducted to child with fear of the dark, and the results were very positive in terms of motivation, satisfaction and tolerance to exposure to dark environments presented in the game. The protoype was developed with Unity3d and deployed on Oculus Go VR head-set.The game consisted of an opne world that was divided into three differently lit areas.The first was set in daylight, the second one in a setting sun phase, and the third was set at night. The fourth and final setting of the game happend in a dark cave where there are no light sources.The world model was built with Gaia (a world-building asset for Unity3D), exported to Blender for stylization and simplification and then imported back into Unity3D, where it was then populated with free 3D assets downloaded from the Unity Asset Store (i.e. trees, grass, water, animals, and other props).The prototype’s environment shares some characteristics with open-world video games, as the player can explore each area at their own pace before deciding to advance to the next one. This aspect was included in the gameplay to allow for the player to advance without feeling pressured by other factors such as in-game time or enemies.This study shows the potential of VR as a therapeutic game for children and should be further explored. Narrative, perceptive imersion and the game environment is able to captivate a child’s attention and motivate them into playing until the end, which will ideally soothe their anxiety, and, through repeated usage of the prototype, lessen the degree of their fear of the dark."

An excessive load during the sports game can disturb the biomechanics of the player’s movements. A precise localization of damaged tissues can improve for the diagnosis, determining treatment and forecasting the time ofreturn to sports. The aim was to estimate the importance of the football biomechanics movement for the anato- my of the groin and to determine the anatomi- cal features of the groin in football players with sports hernia. We analysed the thickness and length measure- ments on MRI of the rectus abdominis muscle in 51 football players of professional and amateur clubs aged 17 to 33 years with groin pain who were treated at the Kyiv Clinical City Hospital No3 for the period 2014-2020. In the second stage of the study, we investigated the peak force of the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis, exter- nal oblique abdominal muscles) and the adductor muscles of both lower extremities using the mi- croFET2 dynamometer for 4 groups of football players. The first group of the study includes 15 football players of professional clubs with sports hernia who had received conservative treatment, the partipants of the second group are 36 football players after laparoscopic hernioplasty, the third group consisted of 54 healthy young football players and 11 teenage footballers. In the third stage of the study, a formula was substantiated, according to which we calculated the accelera- tion of the lower extremity when kicking the ball. The results of the study demostrate that the disruption of the lower extremity biomechanics during kicking the ball cause the appearance of sports hernia in football players. An axial MRI scan of groin areas of football players with sports hernia represented changes in the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis. The groin pain syndrome of football players with sports hernia includes three pathogenetic mechanisms of development: dis- ruption of the biomechanics, muscle imbalance and microtrauma and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4235492052,Study regarding the effects of sprints on the injury rate of football players,2021-03-01,2021,article,"Abstract. The football game in Romania begins to be played according to certain scientifically proven benchmarks, which is evidenced by the results and studies published every year. The latest international studies show that photocell-controlled sprinting over a 50-meter distance at an intensity of more than 95% of the player’s maximum potential decreases the risk of injury during a match. This is due to the fact that there are weekly competitive microcycles in which, through the chosen exercises or just by the nature of the position played, many athletes do not experience this scenario during training but they are fully faced with it during a match. Thus, our purpose was to conduct a comparative study in order to observe the effects of sprints on the injury rate of football players during matches across weekly cycles. Participants in this study were 20 professional football players who, according to the established protocol, followed a preventive injury programme including sprints performed at an intensity of over 95%. These exercises must be practised throughout the training period, our study intending to demonstrate that the game activity is the reference point when building training sessions, and each game scenario should be simulated or practised in the training process."

[Perfil multi-ubicación de carga externa en jugadores de fútbol sub-18].,2021-02-27,2021,article,"An association between accelerometer workload and injury risk has been found previously. However, any research has assessed the absorption dynamics of external workload through the measurement in different anatomical locations simultaneously. A cross-sectional study was designed to: (i) to describe the multi-joint external workload profile of youth soccer players, (ii) to identify differences between-participants related to anatomical locations, (iii) to analyze the workload dynamics at different speeds at joints and body segments, (iv) to characterize the multi-joint individual workload and the within-participants difference in each body segment. Twenty-one U-18 male players, that were part of a Youth Spanish First Division soccer team, performed an incremental running treadmill test and wore four WIMU PROTM inertial devices in lower limb (ankle-knee) and spine (lower-upper back) locations to register cumulative tri-axial accelerometry-based workload (PlayerLoad, PLRT). The main results have shown that the highest PLRT was detected at the lower limb, especially at the ankle. Different dynamics of accelerometer workload have been found between lower and upper limb, being them between ankle-knee at 12-km/h and lower-upper back at 9.5-km/h (p&lt;.05). Between-participants’ differences were shown at all joints, finding the highest differences at the upper back (p&lt;.01; d=2.17). Finally, the body segment knee-lower back reported the highest differences (%diff=34.25-to-67.28; d=2.20-to-4.77). In conclusion, a great between-participants external workload variability was found at joints and body segments, being recommended for an individualized assessment and specific training protocols."

A systematic electronic literature search was carried out in the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. Controlled studies including pre-to-post intervention tests of physical fitness and involving healthy volleyball players regardless of age and sex were considered. A random-effects model was used to calculate effect sizes (ES) between intervention and control groups. Moderator analyses considered programme duration, training frequency, total number of training sessions and jumps, participants' sex, age, and expertise level. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Eighteen moderate-to-high quality (median of 5 PEDro points) studies were eligible, comprising a total of 746 athletes. None of the included studies reported injuries related to the PJT intervention. The main findings showed small-to-moderate effects ( p &amp;lt; 0.05) of PJT on linear sprint speed (ES = 0.70), squat jump (ES = 0.56), countermovement jump (CMJ) (ES = 0.80), CMJ with arm swing (ES = 0.63), drop jump (ES = 0.81), and spike jump height (ES = 0.84). Sub-analyses of moderator factors included 48 data sets. Only age had a significant effect on CMJ performance. Participants aged ≥16 years achieved greater improvements in CMJ performance compared to &amp;lt;16 years old (ES = 1.28 and 0.38, respectively; p = 0.022). No significant differences ( p = 0.422) were identified between amateur (ES = 0.62) and professional volleyball players (ES = 1.01). In conclusion, PJT seems safe and is effective in improving measures of physical fitness in amateur and professional volleyball players, considering studies performed in both male and female."

Contact sports such as American football, are one of the most common sources of concussions. The biomechanical response of the head–helmet system caused by dynamic loading plays a major role. The literature has focused on measuring the resultant kinematics that act on the head and helmet during tackles. However, few studies have focused on helmet validation tests, supported by recent findings and emerging numerical approaches. The future of helmet standards could benefit from insights at the level of injury mechanisms, using numerical tools to assess the helmets. Therefore, in this work, a numerical approach is employed to investigate the influence of intracranial pressure (ICP) on brain pathophysiology during and after helmeted impacts, which are common in American football. The helmeted impacts were performed at several impact locations according to the NOCSAE standard (configurations A, AP, B, C, D, F, R, UT). In order to evaluate the ICP levels, the αHEAD finite element head and brain model was combined with a Hybrid III-neck structure and then coupled with an American football helmet to simulate the NOCSAE impacts. In addition, the ICP level was analyzed together with the resulting HIC value, since the latter is commonly used, in this application and others, as the injury criterion. The obtained results indicate that ICP values exceed the common threshold of head injury criteria and do not correlate with HIC values. Thus, this work raises concern about applying the HIC to predict brain injury in American football direct head impacts, since it does not correlate with ICP predicted with the FE head model."

Seasonal changes in BMD of soccer players have been proposed as well. However, previous investigations were based on short-term observations. Actually, longitudinal investigation of BMD in soccer players is lacking, possibly because of frequent inter-club transfer, changes in club policy or continued availability of the relevant facilities. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)-measured areal BMD (aBMD) was obtained during the competitive season in an elite soccer player along 10 consecutive years. Findings showed that (1) aBMD tends to increase with age, independently of body mass; (2) The right (preferred, kicking) leg has higher aBMD than the left (non-preferred, support) one; (3) Meaningful (i.e., &amp;gt;least significant change, LSC) changes in aBMD take place along the season; and (4) The off-season (transition) period has no effect on aBMD. Findings prompt for future research aimed at clarifying the long-term and seasonal patterns of bone characteristics in soccer in relation with age and type/dose of training. Season-around, long-term scrutiny of bone status in soccer players would help controlling for possible changes/asymmetries in bone mineralization/strength."

The participation rate of people with disabilities (PWDS) in tourism activities is low, and there is a big gap in the travel and accommodation sector in this regard. Studies of previous scholars have concluded that the accessible tourism market is a significant and profitable area, but determinants of participation to travel and process of travel, such as wheelchair user expectations, are consistently ignored by the tourism industry. The main purpose of this study is to determine the determinants of travel by examining the motivations, expectations, processes and experiences of PWDS using wheelchairs to participate in tourism. Research was performed in Turkey’s Bodrum district; 25 wheelchair users were included in the study. The keywords that emerged in the theoretical framework in light of the answers given to 39 open-ended questions online were coded in the Nvivo program. The results showed that wheelchair users intended to go on vacation but were less motivated to participate due to the lack of travel conditions. Wheelchair travelers argued that a companion was required for an enjoyable holiday that could meet their needs. In addition, the results revealed that the types of wheelchairs used by disabled passengers differ. The disabled stated that the wheelchairs they use in daily life are not suitable for use on the beach, sand or water. Despite the economic, social and technological change opportunities, basic tourism service expectations of PWDS are not met. This research project is a comprehensive study that makes determinations in terms of examining the social status of disabled people in terms of social sciences, examining the place and importance of disabled tourists in the market and eliminating the deficiencies of facilities serving in tourism."

However, social robots may help to improve children's motivation and to propose enjoyable and tailored activities. Here, we have used the Co-writer scenario in which a child is asked to teach a robot how to write via demonstration on a tablet, combined with a series of games we developed to train specifically pressure, tilt, speed, and letter liaison controls. This setup was proposed to a 10-year-old boy with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder combining phonological disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, and developmental coordination disorder with severe dysgraphia. Writing impairments were severe and limited his participation in classroom activities despite 2 years of specific support in school and professional speech and motor remediation. We implemented the setup during his occupational therapy for 20 consecutive weekly sessions. We found that his motivation was restored; avoidance behaviors disappeared both during sessions and at school; handwriting quality and posture improved dramatically. In conclusion, treating dysgraphia using child–robot interaction is feasible and improves writing. Larger clinical studies are required to confirm that children with dysgraphia could benefit from this setup."

Countermovement jump and squat jump force-time curve analysis in control and fatigue conditions. J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2752-2761, 2022-This study aimed to reanalyze previously published discrete force data from countermovement jumps (CMJs) and squat jumps (SJs) using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), a statistical method that enables analysis of data in its native, complete state. Statistical parametric mapping analysis of 1-dimensional (1D) force-time curves was compared with previous zero-dimensional (0D) analysis of peak force to assess sensitivity of 1D analysis. Thirty-two subjects completed CMJs and SJs at baseline, 15 minutes, 1, 24, and 48 hours following fatigue and control conditions in a pseudo random cross-over design. Absolute (CMJ ABS /SJ ABS ) and time-normalized (CMJ NORM /SJ NORM ) force-time data were analyzed using SPM 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance with significance accepted at α = 0.05. The SPM indicated a magnitude of difference between force-time data with main effects for time ( p < 0.001) and interaction ( p < 0.001) observed in CMJ ABS , SJ ABS, and SJ NORM, whereas previously published 0D analysis reported no 2-way interaction in CMJ and SJ peak force. This exploratory research demonstrates the strength of SPM to identify changes between entire movement force-time curves. Continued development and use of SPM analysis techniques could present the opportunity for refined assessment of athlete fatigue and readiness with the analysis of complete force-time curves."

Each athlete should be able to perform desired actions efficiently, which will not be possible without coordinated activation of muscles in the kinetic chain. EMG studies demonstrate that lumbar paraspinal muscles fatigue is associated with Quadriceps Inhibition (QI), leading to speculation that these changes may not only have adverse effect for athletic performance but also increase the risk of injury in long term. This contrasts the evidence about the influence of fatigue on trunk muscles reflex activity. Method: 37 athletes (men) were recruited from city soccer clubs. The participants performed sub maximal isometric exercise of lower back extensors (Ito’s test) to induce fatigue. The two protocols were a single bout and repeated bouts of Lumbar Extension Isometric Exercise (LEIE). The Agility scores recorded at baseline, after single bout and after repeated bouts of LEIE were compared. Conclusion: The two experimental interventions differently affected the agility performance in the sample. On one hand, single bout intervention led to improved performance, repeated bout intervention resulted in relative deterioration of performance."

However, self-assessment is often encouraged during learning tasks, especially when being coached on sporting tasks. In this study we examined how attention directed towards an internal psychological aspect, self-efficacy, affected performance in a cricket bowling task. We hypothesised that cricketers who are asked to assess their own ability on a bowling task would show a deterioration in performance compared to control subjects who are asked to assess the ability of another. Participants were asked to rate their self- efficacy levels in the middle of a deliberate practice task. In the pre-test phase, participants attempted to bowl in a game-standard designated “good length” zone across twelve trials. Following this, experimental group members rated their own general and task-specific self-efficacy using Bandura’s self-efficacy questionnaire, while the control group rated someone else’s ability. They each then bowled for twelve more trials, and their performance was measured before and after the self-assessment based on the number of trials that were bowled within the standard “good length” zone. Paired t-tests showed that while the performance of the control group improved significantly from pre-test to post-test, t = 2.613, p = 0.008; the experimental group did not show a significant improvement, t = 1.156, p = 0.131. Results indicate that asking people to rate their confidence level may hinder their improvement on a deliberate practice task. This has implications for sport performance where athletes or coaches might be tempted to self-evaluate before performance, as well as for researchers who consider administering self-efficacy questionnaires prior to performance."

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of concussion in sport have are not precisely known. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the dynamic response of the head based on linear and rotational accelerations in boxing using computer simulation. The ADAMS software model was used to determine the linear and rotational acceleration of boxing’s straight punch. The peak linear acceleration, average linear acceleration, peak rotational acceleration, and average rotational acceleration resulted from the straight punch to head were obtained: 75 g, 20 g, 4036 rad/s², 1140 rad/s², respectively; the impact times were 30 ms and 3 ms, respectively. The comparison of acceleration tolerance thresholds of head injury and obtained results of this study showed the rotational acceleration only leads to head injury. Furthermore, it is biomechanically improbable that the head would be moved only translationally or rotationally as a result of a straight punch. Therefore, both rotational and linear accelerations should be observed together for future studies."

While health-related factors present valid and reliable tests, the skill-related component should be studied in depth. An interesting test to evaluate the skill-related factors is the Harre circuit test (HTC); unfortunately, this test includes the somersault, an element not present in soccer. The aim of the present study is the validation of the Petrucci ability test (PAT), a variation of the HTC without the somersault for young soccer players. Children and adolescents (age range 10–13 years old) soccer players concluded the 20-m, the HTC and the PAT. To establish the validity of the PAT, correlation analysis has been performed, which presented a p &lt; 0.0001 between PAT and HTC; p &lt; 0.001 between PAT and a 20-m test; and p &lt; 0.0001 between HTC and the 20-m test.

The recurrence rate after conservative management remains high and, therefore, primary surgical intervention is sometimes recommended in very young patients whose risk of recurrences is highest. Immobilization in external rotation, first described by Itoi, is a promising conservative option as it provides adequate labral reduction and low recurrence rates. Recent meta-analyzes could not unequivocally demonstrate its superiority over internal rotation immobilization. However, biomechanical and early clinical results show a better effect on reduction of the labrum and lower recurrence rates for immobilization in a combination of abduction/external rotation than for external rotation alone. The present article aims to provide an overview of the conservative management of first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation in order to provide the treating physician or surgeon with the best current evidence as a basis for developing the appropriate treatment strategy for the patient."

Competitive athletes planned for arthroscopic treatment for FAIS were included prospectively in a hip arthroscopy registry. A total of 1548 athletes were identified and 919 were included. Sporting activity and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including HSAS, iHOT-12, and HAGOS, were recorded, pre-operatively. The study comprised 738 male and 181 female athletes (median age 25; interquartile range 20-32 years) who had undergone arthroscopic treatment for FAIS. The most common sports type performed by males were football (48%) and ice hockey (19%) and in females, football (25%) and horseback riding (22%). Females reported a significantly longer duration of symptoms (median 36 vs 24 months) and lower pre-operative scores for the iHOT-12 and all the HAGOS subscales, except for physical activity. In conclusion, horseback riding and football are almost equally common in female athletes, while football is by far the most common in male athletes, who underwent arthroscopic treatment for FAIS. Females had a longer duration of symptoms and a higher degree of self-reported symptoms and dysfunction prior to the hip arthroscopy."

However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the accuracy of these tools to predict soccer-specific injuries. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to determine the psychometric properties or accuracy of screening tools for common soccer injuries. Methods: A systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy was undertaken based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) procedure for conducting systematic reviews. Databases such as SPORT Discus, Cinahl, Medline, Science Direct, PubMed and grey literature were searched in order to access suitable studies. Results: A total of 10 studies were included for the analysis – three were analysed quantitatively whilst the remaining seven were analysed qualitatively. The screening tools were of high reliability, sensitivity and specificity (calculated as intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] (0.68 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–0.84 and 0.64 95% CI: 0.61–0.66, respectively). Conclusion: The screening tools assessed for the prediction of common soccer injuries that emerged from this systematic review include the Functional Movement Screening (FMS™), the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), the Tuck Jump Assessment, the Soccer Injury Movement Screening (SIMS) and the conventional hamstrings to quadriceps ratio; all with good evidence of predicting common soccer injuries. These tools were of high sensitivity and specificity thus reliable for soccer screening. Clinical implications: The validity of these tools is acceptable and therefore the authors recommend that these tools be included in an injury prevention programme for soccer players."

The morphometry of the GM, SM and AT were evaluated.No significant correlation between sex or side and size of the AT in human foetuses was observed. The only significant correlation was between sex and the length of the tendon of the SM; in 3rd trimester it was longer in male than in female. In 2nd trimester the SM muscle to tendon ratio was higher in female than in male.There was no significant correlation between sex or side and size of the AT in human foetuses, probably due to scant muscle load during prenatal period."

However, low level of adoption of these programs remains a problem. Understanding the current warm-ups in youth basketball and coaches' perceptions on injury prevention can guide the design of superior implementation strategies. This study describes warm-ups in youth basketball and coaches' injury prevention-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and information sources. Methods: Youth basketball coaches ( n = 50) completed a preseason questionnaire. The questionnaire covered warm-up length, use of aerobic/agility/balance/strength/other exercises in the warm-up, injury-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and sources of information. Results: Typical warm-up duration was ≤ 10 min (48.0% of coaches, 95% CI: ±13.8%). All coaches included aerobic exercises in their warm-up. Agility, strength, and balance exercises were utilized by 80.0% (95% CI: ±11.7%), 70.7% (95% CI: ±13.6%), and 26.8% (95% CI: ±13.6%) of coaches, respectively. Most coaches agreed to some extent that basketball injuries are preventable (94%) and that participating in a NMT warm-up program would reduce player's risk of injury (92%). Other coaches were identified as the most common source of information on warm-ups and injury prevention. Discussion: Coaches use parts of effective NMT warm-up programs, but balance exercises are not well adopted. Considering the level of evidence supporting the importance of balance exercises in injury prevention, it is crucial to improve the implementation of NMT warm-up programs in youth basketball, for example, through educational courses. As fellow coaches were identified as the most important source of information, coaches' role in knowledge translation should be emphasized."

Among other concepts, the specialized sampling model describes a pathway between early specialization and early sampling and yields promising results in Swiss football. As successful constellations of early sport participation might be affected by sport-specific constraints (e.g., age of peak performance, selection pressure, and physiological/psychological requirements), other popular game sports may show similar promising pathways. This study investigates whether ice hockey, another popular game sport in Switzerland, shows similar successful constellations of early sport participation. A sample of 98 former Swiss junior national team players born between 1984 and 1994 reported on early sport participation through a retrospective questionnaire. Using the person-oriented Linking of Clusters after removal of a Residue (LICUR) method, volumes of in-club practice, free play, and activities besides ice hockey until 12 years of age were analyzed, along with player’s age at initial club participation. The results indicate that ice hockey enthusiasts with the most free play and above-average in-club practice had a greater chance of reaching professional level compared to other groups. This implies that high domain specificity with varied sampling experiences is the most promising approach to developing sporting expertise in ice hockey. As similar results were previously found in Swiss football, comparable sport-specific constraints might indeed require similar constellations of learning activities during early sport participation. Therefore, in popular game sports in Switzerland, the specialized sampling model seems to be most promising."

This study aimed to determine if an association exists between competency in object control skills during early childhood (6-9 years) and the application of these skills during later childhood (12 years). The NW-CHILD longitudinal study (2010-2016), included a baseline and two time-point follow-up measures in grades 1, 4, and 7 of South African children. A total of 374 participants (boys = 178, 47.59% and girls = 196, 52.41%) completed testing at all three time-points and were analyzed. The Test of Gross Motor Development, Second Edition, and the Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment were used to determine associations between object control skill competency during early and later childhood by using descriptive statistics, Spearman rank order correlations, and stepwise regression analysis. The level of object control skill competency at 6 and 9 years, significantly influences the application of these skills at 12 years. A high overall and significant contribution of OCS (4.6%, p < 0.01) to the variance in the skills and time scores at 12 years; p < 0.05 were found. Competence in object control skills at an early age can provide a baseline from where opportunities for progression or transfer of skills can result in more advanced skillful executions which consequently can be considered to be a cornerstone of improved future physical activity and healthier lifestyles."
https://openalex.org/W3129104923,Skill and strategic control,2021-02-08,2021,article,"Abstract This paper provides an account of the strategic control involved in skilled action. When I discuss strategic control, I have in mind the practical goals, plans, and strategies that skilled agents use in order to specify, structure, and organize their skilled actions, which they have learned through practice. The idea is that skilled agents are better than novices not only at implementing the intentions that they have but also at forming the right intentions. More specifically, skilled agents are able formulate and modify, adjust and adapt their practical intentions in ways that are appropriate, effective, and flexible given their overall goals. Further, to specify the kind of action plans that are involved in strategic control, I’ll rely on empirical evidence concerning mental practice and mental imagery from sports psychology as well as evidence highlighting the systematic differences in the cognitive representations of skills between experts and non-experts. I’ll claim that, together, this evidence suggests that the intentions that structure skilled actions are practical and not theoretical, that is, that they are perceptual and motor and not abstract, amodal, or linguistic. Importantly, despite their grounded nature, these plans are still personal-level, deliberate, rational states. That is, the practical intentions used to specify and structure skilled actions are best conceived of as higher-order, motor-modal structures, which can be manipulated and used by the agent for the purpose of reasoning, deliberation, decision-making and, of course, the actual online structuring and organizing of action."

Methods Twenty professional soccer players (age: 24.9 ± 3.5 years; body mass: 71.6 ± 18.7 kg; height: 168.8 ± 41.4 cm) from the same team competing in the First Portuguese League (Europe) voluntarily participated in this study. They were daily monitored with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and the following external load variables were extracted per session: (i) total distance; (ii) running distance; (iii) high-speed running distance; (iv) distance at maximal speed; (v) distance at high accelerations; and (vi) players’ training load. The acute load and acute:chronic workload ratio were weekly calculated for each of the GPS measures. Results Week-by-week variations ranged from –57% to +115%, depending on the playing position and the variable measured. The within-week variability revealed coefficients of variation between 48% and 55%, depending on the measure. Considering the differences in mean load between playing positions, significant differences between players were found for the majority of the variables, with the only exceptions being maximal speed and high accelerations distances. Conclusions Great between-week variations in the acute load as well as the variability of load within weeks were found. It was observed that acute load was position-dependent."

Seventeen professional soccer players volunteered to participate in this study. Peak torque (T peak ) and rate of torque development (RTD) of knee flexor (90°. s –1 , −30°. s –1 ) and extensor (90°. s –1 ) muscles were measured before and after fatigue (i.e., 30 maximal knee extension and flexion repetitions at 180°s –1 ) performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Hamstring to quadriceps peak strength and RTD ratios were calculated. Besides, using surface EMG, the mean level of activation (RMS mean ), Rate of EMG Rise (RER), and EMG Frequency-Time maps were measured on quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Following fatigue, T peak , RTD, RER declined significantly in the two muscle groups (all p &amp;lt; 0.05) without modification of RMS mean . No decrease in conventional and functional H/Q ratios was observed after fatigue except for a significant increase in the H ecc30 / Q con180 ratios (1.03 ± 0.19 vs. 1.36 ± 0.33, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Besides, the RTD H/Q ratios decreased significantly after fatigue, and the statistical parametric mapping analysis (SPM) performed on the EMG/angle curves, and EMG Frequency-Time maps showed that fatigue strongly influenced the muscle activation during the first 100 ms of the movement, following the higher EMG frequency component shift toward the lower frequency component. Our results show that the reduction of RTD and RER during the first 100 ms of the contraction after fatigue exercise makes more sense than any H/Q ratio modification in understanding injury risk in soccer players."

Knowledge of variability between units is required before researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions on ""true"" differences between limbs. Sixteen male college soccer players performed five running-based tasks, generating 224 trials and 17,012 steps. Data were analysed for each task and for the whole session, investigating six IMU Step metrics: step count; impact load; bone stimulus; and low, medium and high intensity steps. Inter-unit reliability was excellent (ICC ≥ 0.90) for 21 out of 26 metrics, and good (0.83 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.86) for all other metrics except for Yo-Yo impact load (ICC = 0.79) which was acceptable. These findings confirm the inter-unit reliability of IMU Step metrics using IMeasureU Blue Trident inertial measurement units for running-based team sports. Now that inter-unit variability has been quantified, researchers and practitioners can use this information when interpreting inter-limb differences for monitoring external biomechanical training load."

Case study,2021-02-04,2021,article,"In our paper, we would like to present two cases of treatment of the Achilles tendon ruptures by means of surgical V-Y technique, and implementation of immediate rehabilitation and weight-bearing. V-Y plasty on ruptured tendons was performed. The continuity of the tendon was restored. The sheath of the tendon was stitched together. Dressing was put on; the foot was immobilized in a Walker-type shoe in pes equinus with heel pads and compression underwear. From the first hour after the procedure, the wound area was cooled with a Game Ready device. From the first day after the procedure, both patients were allowed to apply full weight to the limb in the shoe. The crutches were put away as soon as possible. Rehabilitation began right away on the next day; during its course, attempts were made to reduce the use of the shoe to a minimum and to achieve the full range of foot motion as soon as possible. In both patients, the full range of motion was reached approximately 2 weeks after the surgery. The video support for the article is available at: https://youtu.be/bi3xuwOT9vs"

https://openalex.org/W3209677218,A novel biomechanical injury risk score demonstrates correlation with lower limb posterior chain injury in fifty elite level rugby union athletes,2021-02-03,2021,preprint,"ABSTRACT Objectives Lower limb posterior chain injury (PCI) is common amongst athletic populations, with multi-factorial risk factors including age, previous injury, strength measurements, range of motion and training load. Biomechanics are commonly considered in the prevention and rehabilitation of PCI by performance staff. However, there is no documented testing method to assess for associations between biomechanics and PCI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between an easily applicable, novel biomechanical assessment tool and PCI. Methods Fifty male elite-level rugby union athletes (age 22.83±5.08) participating in the highest tier of England were tested at the start of the 2019 pre-season period and PCIs (N=48) were recorded over the 2019/20 playing season. Participants’ biomechanics were analysed using two-dimensional video analysis against an Injury Risk Score (IRS) system in the performance of the combined movement – prone hip extension and knee flexion. Participants’ biomechanics in carrying out this movement were scored against the 10-point IRS, where the more compensatory movement recorded sees an increase in an individual’s IRS. Participants’ IRS were then compared against the number of PCI sustained and Spearman’s correlation coefficient was utilised for analysis. Results There is a good significant association between IRS and PCI (R=0.573, p&lt;0.001). Linear Regression demonstrated that an increase of 1 in IRS was associated with a 35% increase in PCI incidence (R 2 =0.346). Conclusion A good significance between the IRS and PCI provides preliminary support for its use as an injury risk assessment tool."
https://openalex.org/W3126198382,Force-velocity profiling in athletes: Reliability and agreement across methods,2021-02-01,2021,article,"The aim of the study was to examine the test-retest reliability and agreement across methods for assessing individual force-velocity (FV) profiles of the lower limbs in athletes. Using a multicenter approach, 27 male athletes completed all measurements for the main analysis, with up to 82 male and female athletes on some measurements. The athletes were tested twice before and twice after a 2- to 6-month period of regular training and sport participation. The double testing sessions were separated by ~1 week. Individual FV-profiles were acquired from incremental loading protocols in squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ) and leg press. A force plate, linear encoder and a flight time calculation method were used for measuring force and velocity during SJ and CMJ. A linear regression was fitted to the average force and velocity values for each individual test to extrapolate the FV-variables: theoretical maximal force (F 0 ), velocity (V 0 ), power (P max ), and the slope of the FV-profile (S FV ). Despite strong linearity (R 2 &gt;0.95) for individual FV-profiles, the S FV was unreliable for all measurement methods assessed during vertical jumping (coefficient of variation (CV): 14–30%, interclass correlation coefficient (ICC): 0.36–0.79). Only the leg press exercise, of the four FV-variables, showed acceptable reliability (CV:3.7–8.3%, ICC:0.82–0.98). The agreement across methods for F 0 and P max ranged from (Pearson r): 0.56–0.95, standard error of estimate (SEE%): 5.8–18.8, and for V 0 and S FV r: -0.39–0.78, SEE%: 12.2–37.2. With a typical error of 1.5 cm (5–10% CV) in jump height, S FV and V 0 cannot be accurately obtained, regardless of the measurement method, using a loading range corresponding to 40–70% of F 0 . Efforts should be made to either reduce the variation in jumping performance or to assess loads closer to the FV-intercepts. Coaches and researchers should be aware of the poor reliability of the FV-variables obtained from vertical jumping, and of the differences across measurement methods."

Methods 21 healthy participants (13 men and 8 women) took part in three test series: for the molecular analysis, 15 participants provided hair, blood or saliva time-course sampling for the rhythmicity analysis of core-clock gene expression via RT-PCR. For the exercise tests, 16 participants conducted strength and endurance exercises at different times of the day (9h, 12h, 15h and 18h). Myotonometry was carried out using a digital palpation device (MyotonPRO), five muscles were measured in 11 participants. A computational analysis was performed to relate core-clock gene expression, resting muscle tone and exercise performance. Results Core-clock genes show daily fluctuations in expression in all biological samples tested for all participants. Exercise performance peaks in the late afternoon (15–18 hours for both men and women) and shows variations in performance, depending on the type of exercise (eg, strength vs endurance). Muscle tone varies across the day and higher muscle tone correlates with better performance. Molecular daily profiles correlate with daily variation in exercise performance. Conclusion Training programmes can profit from these findings to increase efficiency and fine-tune timing of training sessions based on the individual molecular data. Our results can benefit both professional athletes, where a fraction of seconds may allow for a gold medal, and rehabilitation in clinical settings to increase therapy efficacy and reduce recovery times."

Research has observed the relationship between lower-extremity musculoskeletal injury and baseline neurocognitive performance; however, the understanding of this relationship is lacking. Exploring this relationship may give further insight into musculoskeletal injury and provide innovative directions for musculoskeletal injury prevention. Clinical Question: Is there a relationship between neurocognitive performance and lower-extremity biomechanics during a jumping or cutting task in healthy adult athletes? Summary of Key Findings: The literature was searched for articles that examined the relationship of a baseline neurocognitive test and a biomechanical analysis following a sports-related task. A total of 3 cross-sectional articles were included. All 3 studies concluded that poorer neurocognitive performance was associated with biomechanical faults that are linked to increased risk or rate of lower-extremity musculoskeletal injury. Clinical Bottom Line: Based on the evidence included, there is a moderate-level evidence to support the relationship between neurocognition and lower-extremity biomechanics in healthy adult athletes. Strength of Recommendation: In accordance with the van Tulder approach, there is a moderate level of evidence due to consistent findings from a combination of high- and limited-quality articles."

There is growing recognition of the problems of shoulder and hip/groin symptoms in this population. Purpose To quantify the prevalence of shoulder and hip/groin pain in water polo players, and to describe how performance and participation were impacted. Secondary aims investigated whether demographic or training variables were associated with levels of symptoms. Design In-season, cross-sectional questionnaire study Methods An online questionnaire was distributed to all adult levels of the Australian water polo community. Participants were asked about demographic and playing history, and then specific injury history at both the shoulder and hip/groin. Each respondent completed an Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) overuse injury questionnaire for the shoulder and hip/groin. Point prevalence and past history were calculated, as well as a morbidity score from OSTRC responses. Risk ratios were used to determine differences between playing levels and sex. Results One hundred, fifty-three respondents completed the questionnaire (57% female). High rates of shoulder pain were reported (38.1% current, 81.2% past history), as well as hip/groin pain (33.1% current, 60.4% past history). Current shoulder pain was a risk factor for hip/groin pain (RR 1.99 (95%CI 1.27-3.12), and hip/groin pain was a risk factor for shoulder pain (RR 1.70 (95%CI 1.23-2.35). Elite-level athletes had higher prevalence (RR 1.87 [95%CI 1.01-3.46]) and past history of hip/groin pain (RR 1.76 [95%CI 1.32-2.36]). Conclusions This is the first study to quantify high self-reported levels of hip/groin pain in water polo athletes. Such high levels may be explained by high amounts of eggbeater kick, especially during skeletal development in adolescence.

Existing research into the treatment of pPCS have evaluated unimodal approaches, despite evidence suggesting that pPCS likely represent an interaction across various symptom clusters. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal, symptom-tailored intervention to accelerate symptom recovery and increase the proportion of children with resolved symptoms at 3 months postconcussion. Methods and analysis In this open-label, assessor-blinded, randomised clinical trial, children with concussion aged 8–18 years will be recruited from The Royal Children’s Hospital (The RCH) emergency department, or referred by a clinician, within 17 days of initial injury. Based on parent ratings of their child’s PCS at ~10 days postinjury, symptomatic children (≥2 symptoms at least 1-point above those endorsed preinjury) will undergo a baseline assessment at 3 weeks postinjury and randomised into either Concussion Essentials (CE, n=108), a multimodal, interdisciplinary delivered, symptom-tailored treatment involving physiotherapy, psychology and education, or usual care (UC, n=108) study arms. CE participants will receive 1 hour of intervention each week, for up to 8 weeks or until pPCS resolve. A postprogramme assessment will be conducted at 3 months postinjury for all participants. Effectiveness of the CE intervention will be determined by the proportion of participants for whom pPCS have resolved at the postprogramme assessment (primary outcome) relative to the UC group. Secondary outcome analyses will examine whether children receiving CE are more likely to demonstrate resolution of pPCS, earlier return to normal activity, higher quality of life and a lower rate of utilisation of health services, compared with the UC group.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association between intra-articular knee injury type and two different KOOS pain thresholds (patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) and Englund symptomatic knee criteria) in the Alberta Youth Prevention of Osteoarthritis (PrE-OA) cohort, which includes participants 3–12 years following a youth sport-related knee injury and uninjured controls with similar age, sex and sport characteristics. Analyses accounted for sex, time since injury and the interaction between time since injury and injury type. Secondary objectives were to report proportions meeting thresholds for KOOS outcomes and minimal detectable change (MDC) from published test–retest reliability data, over a 1–4-year follow-up. Two hundred and fifty-three (253) participants (124 injured, 129 controls) were included in analyses, of which 153 (77 injured, 76 controls) had follow-up data. Similar odds were observed for presence of pain (below PASS threshold) in participants with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)/meniscus injury (odds ratio (OR) 4.2 (97.5% confidence interval (CI): 1.8, 9.9)) and other knee injuries (OR 4.9 (97.5% CI: 1.2, 21.0)), while there were higher odds for presence of Englund “symptomatic knee” criteria in participants with ACL/meniscus injury (OR 13.6 (97.5% CI: 2.9, 63.4)) than other knee injuries (OR 7.3 (97.5% CI: 0.8, 63.7)) compared to controls. After a median 23.4 (8 to 42) month follow-up, 35% of previously injured participants had at least one KOOS sub-scale score that worsened by more than the MDC published threshold. Despite limited research, this study shows that individuals with youth sport knee injuries other than ACL or meniscus injury may also experience significant pain and symptoms 3–12 years following injury.

We provided information regarding the characteristics and effectiveness of an alternative rehabilitation exercise developed for children with lower-limb amputation. METHODS: An 8-year-old boy with a below-knee amputation and a 9-year-old bilateral amputee girl performed an exercise program of one 2-h session per week for 20 weeks, aimed at developing muscular strength and coordination. Walking ability and walking speed were assessed by using the L-test of functional mobility and 10-m walk test, respectively. Mechanical and neuromuscular muscle function was assessed by using tensiomyography. RESULTS: In case 1, a decrement of 9.5% and 10.5% was found in the L-test (42 s vs. 38 s) and in the 10-m test (19 s vs. 17 s) scores, respectively. In case 2, walking ability remained unchanged (L-test score: 38 s), while a 5.2% reduction in walking speed was observed (10-m test score: 19 s vs. 18 s). No relevant changes were observed in the muscular tone in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners should be aware that, contrary to what could be expected, a multidisciplinary training program held once per week for 5 months had a minimal impact on the gait pattern and neuromuscular function of two children with lower-limb amputation."

This paper reports an interaction in which the application of a categorical adult-based process (Voice Assimilation) is conditioned by a gradient child-specific process (fricative devoicing). Acoustic analyses of longitudinal data from a Polish-speaking child reveal variable Voice Assimilation effects in target voiced fricative–stop/stop–fricative clusters (voicing and devoicing), correlated with the extent of voicing in fricatives in non-assimilatory contexts. I analyse this phonology–phonetics trade-off by appealing to symbol-like dynamical representations, expressed in the language of non-linear mathematics. Such representations offer a non-derivational link between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of speech. Variability ensues as a natural consequence of grammar change."

Arthroscopic Bankart repair and the open Latarjet are two commonly used surgical stabilisation procedures. There is a lack of knowledge surrounding movement strategies, joint loading and muscle strength after each of these procedures. This study will compare: (1) shoulder joint neuromechanics during activities of daily living and an overhead sporting task; (2) shoulder range of motion; (3) shoulder strength; and (4) self-reported shoulder function and health status, between individuals who have undergone an arthroscopic Bankart repair versus open Latarjet.This is a prospective cohort, single-centre, non-randomised parallel arm study of surgical interventions for athletic shoulder instability injuries. Thirty participants will be recruited. Of these, 20 will have experienced one or more traumatic shoulder instability injuries requiring surgical stabilisation-and will undergo an arthroscopic Bankart repair or open Latarjet procedure. The remaining 10 participants will have no history of shoulder instability injury and act as controls. Participants will undergo baseline testing and be followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months.

C-ACL injury often contributes to a further decline in function and quality of life, including failure to return to sport. There is, however, very limited knowledge about which risk factors that contribute to C-ACL injury. Objective To systematically review instrinsic risk factors for sustaining a C-ACL injury. Methods A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Sport Discus) were searched from inception to January 2020. Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective studies investigating any intrinsic risk factor for future C-ACL injury. Meta-analysis was performed and expressed as odds ratios (OR) if two or more articles assessed the same risk factor. Results 44 moderate-to-high quality studies were eventually included in this review, whereof 35 studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including up to 59 000 individuals. We identified seven factors independently increasing the odds of sustaining a C-ACL injury (in order of highest to lowest OR): (1) returning to a high activity level (OR 3.26, 95% CI 2.10–5.06); (2) Body Mass Index &lt; 25 (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.73–4.36); (3) age ≤ 18 years (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.51–3.88); (4) family history of ACL injury (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.54–2.80); (5) primary ACL reconstruction performed ≤ 3 months post injury (OR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.32–2.06); (6) female sex (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14–1.61); and (7) concomitant meniscal injury (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.42). The following two factors were associated with decreased odds of a subsequent C-ACL injury: 1) decreased intercondylar notch width/width of the distal femur ratio (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25–0.69) and 2) concomitant cartilage injury (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69–1.00). There were no associations between the odds of sustaining a C-ACL injury and smoking status, pre-injury activity level, playing soccer compared to other sports or timing of return to sport. No studies of neuromuscular function in relation to risk of C-ACL injury were eligible for meta-analysis according to our criteria. Conclusion This review provides evidence that demographic factors such as female sex, young age (≤ 18 years) and family history of ACL injury, as well as early reconstruction and returning to a high activity level increase the risk of C-ACL injury. Given the lack of studies related to neuromuscular factors that may be modifiable by training, future studies are warranted that investigate the possible role of factors such as dynamic knee stability and alignment, muscle activation and/or strength and proprioception as well as sport-specific training prior to return-to-sport for C-ACL injuries.

Review Article,2021-01-30,2021,article,"The game of basketball is characterized by short and intense bouts of activity at medium to high frequency. Basketball entails specific types of movements, physiological requirements and energy sources. The duration of physiological responses involving ATP, CP and glycolysis responses to this type of activity is 5-6 seconds for a single sprint, and a contribution of the aerobic system is of less than 10%. Recovery periods in basketball, as a rule, are not long enough to fill the gap for such high intensity activities. It is hard to achieve the same level of performance consistently over time in repeated sprints. This means that basketball players need great athletic ability in order to demonstrate speed, strength and power required to produce a successful performance most proficiently. Therefore, tests are needed to help coaches to monitor their players and ensure that they have the physiological capacity required for the game. The aim of fitness tests is to assess the condition of athletes in terms of each fitness component, in order to determine what needs to be improved through the training program and to conduct retests at set times to assess whether their condition has changed. The literature offers a number of widely used tests to measure aerobic and anaerobic fitness. This article reviews the physiological demands of basketball and analyzes the field tests commonly used at present. The article emphasizes the need for a specific test that will serve coaches and physical fitness trainers in monitoring their players."

Overall, quadriceps and hamstrings inter-limb strength asymmetry was greater in amateurs than professional (small to very large) and elite academy (trivial to large) players. The present findings provide coaches and medical staffs with normative lower-limb muscle strength data on professional, academy and amateur soccer players. Overall lower-limb muscle strength and inter-limb strength asymmetry could be used to evaluate possible inference on injury prevention and performance. The hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio poorly differentiates between the soccer players background and offers limited prediction for injury prevention and performance."

The head-neck-torso alignment is considered to be of great importance when it comes to minimizing potential risks when heading. Therefore, this study determined the relationship between head-neck-torso alignment (cervical spine, head, thoracic spine) and the acceleration of the head, the relationship between head acceleration and maximum ball speed after head impact and differences between head accelerations throughout different heading approaches (standing, jumping, running). A total of 60 male soccer players (18.9 ± 4.0 years, 177.6 ± 14.9 cm, 73.1 ± 8.6 kg) participated in the study. Head accelerations were measured by a telemetric Noraxon DTS 3D Sensor, whereas angles for the head-neck-torso alignment and ball speed were analyzed with a Qualisys Track Manager program. No relationship at all was found for the standing, jumping and running approaches. Concerning the relationship between head acceleration and maximum ball speed after head impact only for the standing header a significant result was calculated (p = 0.024, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .085). A significant difference in head acceleration (p &lt; .001) was identified between standing, jumping and running headers. To sum up, the relationship between head acceleration and head-neck-torso alignment is more complex than initially assumed and could not be proven in this study. Furthermore first data were generated to check whether the acceleration of the head is a predictor for the resulting maximum ball speed after head impact, but further investigations have to follow. Lastly, we confirmed the results that the head acceleration differs with the approach."

https://openalex.org/W3128357548,The effect of change of direction angle on kneeand hip biomechanics : implications foranterior cruciate ligament injury,2021-01-29,2021,dissertation,"ACL injuries have been referred to poor mechanics as they frequently occur without contact. Changes in the knee valgus (abduction) angle and knee valgus (external abduction) moment and limb asymmetry have been linked to greater risk of ACL
injury. Change of direction (COD) manoeuvres are important for many field sports, however they are unfortunately associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. There is limited literature exploring the associations between lower-limb biomechanical variables during COD manoeuvre associated with ACL injuries. Although players frequently COD at >90° angles, limited knowledge is available on hip and knee joints kinematics and kinetics in term of limb asymmetry and differences between COD at 90° and 135° manoeuvres. In addition, high knee valgus angle and moment during COD manoeuvre is associated with joint positions including increased hip flexion, abduction and internal rotation angles. In addition, isometric hip muscle strength has been reported to predict ACL injuries, indicating that weakness in hip muscles is a modifiable risk factor of the non-contact ACL
injury. However, the relationship between knee valgus angle and moment with hip kinematics and muscle strength during COD at 90° and 135° manoeuvres still unknown. Currently, there has been no published research correlating the hip abductor, extensor, and external rotator strength on frontal plane hip and knee biomechanics during 90° and 135° COD manoeuvres. Therefore, the purposes of this thesis was to (1) determine whether asymmetry in knee and hip biomechanics kinematics and kinetics and hip muscle strength between preferred and nonpreferred limbs during COD manoeuvres at 90° and 135° angles exists, (2)
determine whether differences in knee and hip biomechanics kinematics and kinetics between COD manoeuvres at 90° and 135° angles exists and (3) explore the relationships between ACL injury risk factors (knee valgus angle and moment) and hip kinematics and muscles strength during 90° and 135° COD manoeuvres.
Three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis technique is a gold stander to assess biomechanical lower-limb during functional activities. In fact, the gold standard for examining lower limb biomechanics is 3D motion analysis system and allows researchers to calculate all three motion planes during dynamic manoeuvres. In
addition, the isokinetic dynamometer has been considered as a gold standard measurement tool for assessing isometric hip muscle strength and become more popular in sport, research and clinic setting. Healthy male recreational soccer players performed COD manoeuvres at 90° and 135° angles and maximal voluntary
isometric contractions of the hip abductors, extensors, and external rotators. From recorded motion capture, ground reaction force data and hip and knee biomechanics as well as, hip muscles peak torque were calculated. To determine limb asymmetry,
a paired sample t-test was conducted using a Holm method correction. Then, pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was used to explore the relationships between hip kinematics and strength and knee valgus angle and moment. 36 individuals took part in the study (24.25 ±6.21 years, 1.72 ±0.06 m and 66.41 ±10.83 kg). At 135° COD, participants showed greater knee valgus angles at initial
contact and greater peak external knee abduction moments than at 90°. However, no effect of COD angles on knee flexion angle and peak vGRF were found. The results suggest that there were no differences between preferred and non-preferred limbs. Furthermore, the results highlight an important role the hip motion play in controlling kinematic and kinetic risk factors of ACL injury during COD manoeuvres. The findings provided some support that excessive knee valgus angle and moment is potentially associated with poor hip control in all planes. However, there were no
significant correlation between hip muscles strength and knee frontal plane kinetics and kinematics. It can be concluded that different COD angles demand different hip and knee kinematics and kinetics. The results suggest that sharper COD angle place the knee at more risk for ACL injuries. COD manoeuvres at 90° may be useful for evaluating of individuals but may not be challenging enough to reveal poor neuromuscular control over hip and knee motion. Therefore, sharper angles of examination should be utilized in the evaluation of individuals. Moreover, these results may help provide an appropriate manipulation and intervention on COD manoeuvre to reduce the risk of ACL injury. The findings of this study will increase the knowledge base of ACL injury and can aid in the design of more appropriate neuromuscular and plyometric
training protocols for injury prevention."

Nineteen elite professional male players from a Portuguese team (age: 26.5 ± 4.3 years) were monitored daily using global positioning systems (GPSs) over a full season (45 weeks). Accelerometry-derived measures of high metabolic load distance (HMLD), high accelerations (HA), and high decelerations (HD) were collected during each training session and match. Seven congested weeks were classified throughout the season, and the participation of each player in matches played during these weeks was codified. The workload indices of AL (classified as ACWR, TM, and TS) were calculated weekly for each player. The AL of HMLD was significantly greater for S2M than S1M (difference = 42%; p = 0.002; d = 0.977) and for S3M than S1M (difference = 44%; p = 0.001; d = 1.231).

T2* maps may provide a noninvasive means to assess tendon damage and healing. This pilot study evaluated the longitudinal relationship of an induced mechanical strain on the patellar tendon with corresponding UTE T2* metrics, histologic and biomechanical evaluation at two post-operative time points.A total of 27 patellar tendons in male Beagles were surgically subjected to stretching by a small diameter (SmD) or a large diameter (LgD) diameter rod to induce damage due to strain, and evaluated at 4- and 8-week intervals using quantitative MRI (qMRI), biomechanical testing, and histology. A separate set of 16 limbs were used as controls.The tendons experienced a 67% and 17% prolongation of short T2* values as compared to controls at 4 and 8 weeks post-operatively, respectively. Histologic analysis displayed a trend of increased collagen disruption at 4 weeks followed by presence of greater organization at 8 weeks. Biomechanical evaluation found a reduction of tendon modulus and failure strain at both time points, and an increase in cross-sectional area at 4 weeks as compared to controls.These findings display tendon healing in response to an imposed strain and present the utility of qMRI to evaluate longitudinal differences of patellar tendon T2* values in a model of induced subclinical tendon damage. The qMRI technique of UTE provides a means to non-invasively evaluate the healing process of a mechanically damaged tendon."

Consequently, this study compared the external and internal loads between backward and forward locomotion during intermittent exercise in team sport athletes. Semi-professional, male rugby league players (n = 29) completed the same exercise protocol on two occasions in backward and forward directions. On each occasion, participants performed separate 20 m trials at self-selected walking, jogging, running, and sprinting speeds and then completed a 15 min modified Loughborough intermittent shuttle test (mLIST). Common external and internal load metrics were gathered across testing. Faster speeds (p &lt; 0.001) were attained at all speeds during forward locomotion in the 20 m trials. Non-significant differences in accumulated PlayerLoadTM were found between directions across the mLIST; however, higher relative (per min) PlayerLoadTM (p &lt; 0.001) was apparent during backward locomotion when walking and during forward locomotion when sprinting during the mLIST. RPE and mean heart rate were higher (p &lt; 0.001) during backward locomotion across the mLIST. These data highlight the unique loading patterns experienced during backward locomotion and suggest practitioners should consider the discernment in loading imposed between backward and forward locomotion when measuring athlete demands using common metrics."
https://openalex.org/W3124755056,CORR Insights®: A Cam Morphology Develops in the Early Phase of the Final Growth Spurt in Adolescent Ice Hockey Players: Results of a Prospective MRI-based Study,2021-01-25,2021,letter,"Where Are We Now? Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) consists of abnormal bony morphology of the femoral head/neck junction (cam morphology) and/or acetabulum (pincer morphology), which can lead to articular cartilage and labral injury as well as clinical symptoms from altered mechanical loading of the hip joint in some patients. Although some have considered FAI (and the cam morphology, more specifically) to be modern phenomena [7], there is evidence that this is not the case [12]. Regardless, there seems to be some evidence that environmental factors matter, since participation in high-intensity and high-impact sports during skeletal maturation appears to be associated with the development of FAI [10]. Multiple studies have shown radiographic findings consistent with FAI in high-level adolescent and young adult male athletes [3, 8-10]. Another study of 63 women collegiate athletes (soccer, track/field, volleyball) showed 48% of hips had radiographic findings for cam morphology [6]. Based on data from these and other similar studies, researchers generally believe that elite athletes in high-intensity/impact sports have increased risk for FAI because of factors associated with their training and with sports that alter physeal growth during skeletal development [10]. To further evaluate the development of FAI during skeletal maturation, one research team prospectively followed a cohort of elite pre-professional adolescent male soccer players from the Netherlands over 5 years and found that cam morphology in plain radiographs developed in 73% of players by skeletal maturity at age 18 [1, 11]. The current study by Hanke et al. [5] sheds additional light on this process. They shared findings from a prospective, longitudinal MRI analysis about the development of cam morphologies in adolescent ice hockey players. Performing baseline, 1.5-year, and 3-year follow-up MRIs on players beginning at age 12 to 13 years, the authors found that 12 of 23 (52%) players developed a cam morphology within 3 years. They also found a correlation between physeal extension of the proximal femoral physis and higher alpha angle, indicating an underlying growth disturbance may be associated with cam development. The authors conclude that cam morphology develops during the early phase of the final growth spurt of the proximal femur between ages 13 to 16 years. This is important because understanding that cam morphology develops from a growth plate disturbance during a specific period of skeletal development will help to direct future research focused on prevention of this phenomenon. Surgeons caring for young athletes might also consider thorough counseling of this pathology for their patients as well as close clinical examination to survey for signs and symptoms consistent with cam development. Where Do We Need To Go? Based on these novel findings, researchers should develop studies that can pinpoint the exact causes of growth disturbances to the proximal femoral physis with an ultimate goal of establishing preventative measures. One initial area of focus should assess whether there is a specific activity such as running, jumping, or cutting that increases the likelihood that cam morphology will develop. There are several questions to consider: Are there particular motions or movements inherent to ice hockey, soccer, basketball, and American football that cause athletes to form cam morphologies? Is it simply the act of overloading the hip through intense running/sprinting or rather a cutting/pivoting motion with repetitive flexion and internal rotation of the hip that leads to the physeal disturbance? Another possibility is that the activity level and duration of training during skeletal maturation may be a greater risk factor for cam development than the types of activities themselves. Should there be a critical limit to hours of training per day or number of days per week in adolescent athletes? This threshold would be akin to a pitch count limit in skeletally immature pitchers in order to protect the long-term health of their arms. Lastly, can FAI development be one of the oft-discussed perils of single-sport specialization? Topical research has shown many deleterious effects of early single-sport specialization for youth such as increased risk for overuse injuries. It would therefore be valuable to assess whether cam development is more common in single-sport athletes compared to multisport athletes. The good news is that the above-mentioned potential culprits leading to the development of the cam morphology all are modifiable. If we can identify the exact stressors and modify those activities in high-risk groups, then we may see a decrease in the incidence of FAI. How Do We Get There? Reducing the frequency of FAI is within our grasp. One reason for my optimism is that we don’t need to develop new technology to answer the main questions I listed earlier. With clinical and translational research tools such as advanced imaging techniques already at our disposal and the knowledge we now possess about the most at-risk populations and the most vulnerable time periods, studies can be started immediately to identify the causes of cam development. The first step should be to enroll high-level adolescent athletes—both boys and girls—at ages 11 to 13 years (before the final growth spurt phase) from sports such as basketball, soccer, and football into prospective cohorts. Matching the cohorts can help to control for certain variables, such as age, gender, BMI, sport, and competition level. Longitudinal evaluation of the duration of training as well as types of exercises/activities performed will build a database on individual activity level and the types of exercises/activities being performed. Additional interval biomechanical analyses may be helpful in understanding hip and lower extremity kinematics during growth. Lastly, routine MRI evaluation at regular timepoints, such as that performed by Hanke et al. [5], will be crucial for future studies to evaluate early changes in bony morphology as well as physeal disturbances. One translational tool that may provide a breakthrough for this analysis is the use of quantitative MRI (qMRI) sequences such as T1rho or T2 mapping to assess changes in cartilage composition at the molecular level [2, 4]. By adding qMRI sequences to surveillance MRI during skeletal growth, we may be able to detect and localize early changes to the proximal femoral physis that would later develop into cam morphologies. Thus, with the ability to target high-risk cohorts and the availability of modern imaging techniques, I expect that our insights on the development of the cam morphology will grow exponentially in the next decade. Although arthroscopic surgery for FAI can provide significant clinical improvement, not every patient with symptomatic FAI can be successfully treated, and irreversible degenerative changes may occur at an early age, sometimes even before patients exhibit symptoms. Therefore, decreasing the incidence of FAI in high-risk groups as well as the general population should be a focal point for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3123304252,Player position in American football influences the magnitude of mechanical strains produced in the location of chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology: A computational modelling study,2021-01-23,2021,article,"American football players are frequently exposed to head impacts, which can cause concussions and may lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Player position appears to influence the risk of concussion but there is limited work on its effect on the risk of CTE. Computational modelling has shown that large brain deformations during head impacts co-localise with CTE pathology in sulci. Here we test whether player position has an effect on brain deformation within the sulci, a possible biomechanical trigger for CTE. We physically reconstructed 148 head impact events from video footage of American Football games. Players were separated into 3 different position profiles based on the magnitude and frequency of impacts. A detailed finite element model of TBI was then used to predict Green-Lagrange strain and strain rate across the brain and in sulci. Using a one-way ANOVA, we found that in positions where players were exposed to large magnitude and low frequency impacts (e.g. defensive back and wide receiver), strain and strain rate across the brain and in sulci were highest. We also found that rotational head motion is a key determinant in producing large strains and strain rates in the sulci. Our results suggest that player position has a significant effect on impact kinematics, influencing the magnitude of deformations within sulci, which spatially corresponds to where CTE pathology is observed. This work can inform future studies investigating different player-position risks for concussion and CTE and guide design of prevention systems."

After an electronic search, 10 peer-reviewed articles were considered in the meta-analysis. The athletes included in this meta-analysis were amateur to professional level male soccer players (age range, 14–23 years). These studies incorporated CT in soccer players who were compared to a control group. Significant moderate to large improvements were observed in the CT group [sprint: standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.92–1.91; jump: SMD = 0.96–1.58; COD: SMD = 0.97–1.49] when compared to control groups. Subgroup analysis were also conducted based on age, duration, and competitive level. The beneficial effects of CT were greater in players &amp;lt;18 vs. ≥18 years (linear sprinting; SMD = 2.01 vs. −0.13), after ≥8 vs. &amp;lt;8 weeks (jumping and COD; SMD = 1.55–2.01 vs. 0.31–0.64, respectively) and among professional vs. amateur players (linear sprinting and with COD; SMD = 1.53–1.58 vs. 0.08–0.63, respectively). In conclusion, regular soccer training programs may be supplemented with CT to improve sprint, jump, and COD performance. A longer duration of CT (≥8 weeks) seems to be optimal in improving the physical abilities of soccer players. Professional players and &amp;lt;18 years players may benefit more from CT program."

https://openalex.org/W3122934572,The Effect of Player Contact Characteristics on Head Impact Exposure in Youth Football Games,2021-01-22,2021,article,"To reduce head impact exposure (HIE) in youth football, further understanding of the context in which head impacts occur and the associated biomechanics is needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of contact characteristics on HIE during player versus player contact scenarios in youth football. Head impact data and time-synchronized video were collected from 4 youth football games over 2 seasons in which opposing teams were instrumented with the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System. Coded contact characteristics included the player's role in the contact, player speed and body position, contact height, type, and direction, and head contact surface. Head accelerations were compared among the contact characteristics using mixed-effects models. Among 72 instrumented athletes, 446 contact scenarios (n = 557 impacts) with visible opposing instrumented players were identified. When at least one player had a recorded impact, players who were struck tended to have higher rotational acceleration than players in striking positions. When both players had a recorded impact, lighter players and taller players experienced higher mean head accelerations compared with heavier players and shorter players. Understanding the factors influencing HIE during contact events in football may help inform methods to reduce head injury risk."

Biomechanical analysis of the tuck jump assessment. J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2946-2949, 2022-The tuck jump assessment (TJA) examines plyometric technique flaws associated with the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Biomechanical data to investigate the mechanics used during the TJA are limited and assessing each jump individually across the entire test period is time inefficient. This study examined performance characteristics and movement mechanics in 16 professional soccer players during a standardized TJA protocol (10 jumps) to determine if sensitive periods exist within the test period (first 5 vs. last 5). Jump height, average power (PW) reactive strength index (RSI), frontal plane projection angle (FPPA), knee angular velocity (AV), and peak knee flexion angle (PKA) were analyzed using an optoelectrical and inertial measurement unit device. Jump height and PW increased in the past 5 jumps displaying a medium effect size (d = > 0.5). A trend was observed of increased AV, FPPA, and PKA during the past 5 jumps; however, no meaningful differences were observed between respective jump phases, and effect sizes were small (d ≤ 0.2). This study indicates that performance metrics increase during the past 5 jumps of a standardized TJA 10-jump protocol; thus, analyzing the entire test period may not be required, providing a time-efficient approach. Caution should be applied if using this protocol as an injury risk screening tool or to identify fatigue related alterations in male professional soccer players as no obvious movement abnormalities were apparent and minimal differences were present between jump phases in a range of kinematic variables across the recorded test duration."
https://openalex.org/W3124428807,A Standardized Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test After Sport-Related Concussion in Youth: Do ActiGraph Algorithms Matter?,2021-01-22,2021,article,"Context Current guidelines for recovery after sport-related concussion (SRC) recommend 24 to 48 hours of rest, followed by a gradual return to activity with heart rate (HR) maintained below the symptom threshold. In addition, monitoring physical activity (PA) after SRC using ActiGraph accelerometers can provide further objective insight into the amounts of activity associated with recovery trajectories. Cutpoint algorithms for these devices allow minute-by-minute PA to be classified into intensity domains; however, researchers have shown that different algorithms used to evaluate the same healthy participant dataset can produce various classifications. Objective To identify the more physiologically appropriate cutpoint algorithm (Evenson or Romanzini) to analyze ActiGraph data among concussed adolescents in comparison with their HR responses on the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting University sport concussion clinic. Patients or Other Participants Eleven high school students (5 boys, 6 girls; median [range] age = 16 years [15–17 years], height = 177.8 cm [157.5–198.1 cm], mass = 67 kg [52–98 kg], body mass index = 22 [17–31]) involved in high-risk sports who sustained a physician-diagnosed SRC. Main Outcome Measure(s) Evenson and Romanzini algorithm PA intensity domains via ActiGraph data and HR during the BCTT. Results We observed differences in PA time classified as moderate (P = .003) and vigorous (P = .004) intensities between algorithms but no difference in PA time classified as light intensity (P = .48). The Evenson algorithm classified most of the time as moderate-intensity PA (mean = 57.03%, range = 0.00%–94.12%), whereas the Romanzini algorithm classified virtually all PA as vigorous intensity (mean = 88.25%, range = 2.94%–97.06%]). Physical activity based on HR (stages 1–7 = 20%–39% HR reserve [HRR], stages 8–13 = 40%–59% HRR, stages ≥14 = 60%–85% HRR) indicated the BCTT primarily involved light to moderate intensity and, therefore, was better represented by the Evenson algorithm. Conclusions The Evenson algorithm better characterized the HR response during a standardized exercise test in concussed individuals and, thus, should be used to analyze ActiGraph PA data in pediatric populations with concussion."

Rating methods and test standards are used to evaluate different helmet designs and safety performance. Both strain-based injury criteria obtained from finite element brain injury models and metrics derived from global kinematic responses can be used to evaluate helmet safety performance. Little is known about how different injury models or injury metrics would rank and rate different helmets. The objective of this study was to determine how eight brain models and eight metrics based on global kinematics rank and rate a large number of bicycle helmets (n=17) subjected to oblique impacts. The results showed that the ranking and rating are influenced by the choice of model and metric. Kendall's tau varied between 0.50 and 0.95 when the ranking was based on maximum principal strain from brain models. One specific helmet was rated as 2-star when using one brain model but as 4-star by another model. This could cause confusion for consumers rather than inform them of the relative safety performance of a helmet. Therefore, we suggest that the biomechanics community should create a norm or recommendation for future ranking and rating methods."

The current study explores the kinematics, kinetics, rate of oxygen consumption and user preference of nine individuals with below-knee limb loss. Participants walked on a passive prosthetic foot in two configurations: with a Flexible, articulating toe joint and with a Locked-out toe joint. During level treadmill gait, participants exhibited a decrease in Push-Off work when using the Flexible toe joint prosthesis versus the Locked toe joint prosthesis: 16% less from the prosthesis (p = 0.004) and 10% less at the center of mass level (p = 0.039). However, between configurations, participants exhibited little change in other gait kinematics or kinetics, and no apparent or consistent difference in the rate of oxygen consumption (p = 0.097). None of the traditional biomechanical or metabolic outcomes seemed to explain user preference. However, an unexpected and intriguing observation was that all participants who wore the prosthesis on their dominant limb preferred the Flexible toe joint, and every other participant preferred the Locked configuration. Although perhaps coincidental, such findings may suggest a potential link between user preference and limb dominance, offering an interesting avenue for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3122657378,The Impact of a Single Stretching Session on Running Performance and Running Economy: A Scoping Review,2021-01-20,2021,review,"One determining factor for running performance is running economy (RE), which can be quantified as the steady-state oxygen consumption at a given running speed. Stretching is frequently applied in sports practice and has been widely investigated in recent years. However, the effect of stretching on RE and performance is not clear. Thus, the purpose of this scoping review is to investigate the effects of a single bout of stretching on RE and running performance in athletes (e.g., recreational and elites) and non-athletes. The online search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Only studies that explored the acute effects of stretching on RE (or similar variables) and/or running performance variables with healthy and adult participants, independent of activity level, were included in this review. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 44 parameters (14 performance-related/30 metabolic parameters) and 111 participants. Regardless of the stretching technique, there was an improvement both in performance variables (21.4%) and metabolic variables (13.3%) following an acute bout of stretching. However, detrimental effects in performance variables (28.5%) and metabolic variables (6.6%) were also reported, though the results were influenced by the stretching duration and technique. Although it was observed that a single static stretching exercise with a duration of up to 90 s per muscle group can lead to small improvements in RE (1.0%; 95% CI: −1.04 to 2.22), negative effects were reported in running performance (−1.4%; 95% CI: −3.07 to −0.17). It was also observed that a single bout of dynamic stretching only resulted in a negligible change in RE −0.79% (95% CI: −0.95 to 4.18) but a large increase in running performance (9.8%; 95% CI: −3.28 to 16.78), with an overall stretch duration (including all muscles) between 217 and 900 s. Therefore, if stretching is applied without additional warm-up, the results suggest applying dynamic stretching (for a short overall stretching duration of ≤220 s) rather than static stretching if the goal is to increase running performance. In general, only short static stretching durations of ≤60 s per muscle–tendon unit are advisable. One study reported that less flexible runners have greater benefits from stretching than athletes with normal flexibility. In addition, it can be suggested that less flexible runners should aim for an optimum amount of flexibility, which would likely result in a more economical run."

As such, a successful and sustainable return to sport will require extensive modifications to the current operations of sporting organizations. In this article we argue that methods from the realm of sociotechnical systems (STS) theory are highly suited for this purpose. The aim of the study was to use such methods to develop a model of an Australian Football League (AFL) club’s football department. The intention was to identify potential modifications to the club’s operations to support a return to competition following the COVID-19 crisis. Subject Matter Experts from an AFL club participated in three online workshops to develop Work Domain Analysis and Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis models. The results demonstrated the inherent complexity of an AFL football department via numerous interacting values, functions and processes influencing the goals of the system. Conflicts within the system were captured via the modeling and included pursing goals that may not fully reflect the state of the system, a lack of formal assessment of core values, overlapping functions and objects, and an overemphasis on specialized roles. The current analysis has highlighted potential areas for modification in the football department, and sports performance departments in general."

Postoperative rehabilitation is critical, requiring patients to complete home exercise programs (HEPs). To address obstacles to HEP adherence, we developed an interactive health technology, &lt;i&gt;interACTION (iA)&lt;/i&gt;, to monitor knee-specific rehabilitation. &lt;i&gt;iA&lt;/i&gt; is a web-based platform that incorporates wearable motion sensors and a mobile app that provides feedback and allows remote monitoring. The Wheel of Sukr is a gamification mechanism that includes numerous behavioral elements. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This study aims to use a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral change strategies derived from self-management theory into &lt;i&gt;iA&lt;/i&gt; using the Wheel of Sukr, with the aim of influencing patient behavior. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> In total, 10 athletes aged 10-18 years with a history of ACL-R were included in this study. Patients were between 4 weeks and 1 year post–ACL-R. Participants underwent a 60-minute triphasic interview. Phase 1 focused on elements of gaming that led to high participation and information regarding surgery and recovery. In phase 2, participants were asked to &lt;i&gt;think aloud&lt;/i&gt; and rank cards representing the components of the Wheel of Sukr in order of interest. In phase 3, the patients reviewed the current version of &lt;i&gt;iA&lt;/i&gt;. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked for accuracy. Qualitative content analysis segmented the data and tagged meaningful codes until descriptive redundancy was achieved; next, 2 coders independently coded the data set. These elements were categorized according to the Wheel of Sukr framework. The mean age of participants was 12.8 (SD 1.32) years, and 70% (7/10) were female. Most participants (7/10, 70%) reported attending sessions twice weekly. All patients were prescribed home exercises. Self-reported HEP compliance was 75%-100% in 40% (4/10), 50%-75% in 40% (4/10), and 25%-50% of prescribed exercises in 20% (2/10) of the participants. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> The participants responded positively to an app that could track home exercises.

In previous studies, it was demonstrated that patients following ACL reconstruction may present motor deficits which may be related to increased risk of injury. The objective of the study was to determine whether players who have passed RTS assessment still have deficits in movement patterns or in neuromuscular control after such a serious injury as ACL rupture and reconstruction,. Sixty-five male football players (age 18–25 years), recruited from regional teams, were divided into three groups: (1) ACL group-subjects after ACL rupture and reconstruction (n = 24); (2) Mild Injury (MI) group-subjects after mild lower limb injuries (n = 21); and (3) Control (C) group-subjects without injuries (n = 20). For all groups, the Y-balance test, Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and Tuck Jump Assessment (TJA) were performed. For the Y-balance test in ACL group for the injured leg, significantly lower values were demonstrated for anterior reach ((ACL) 69.2 ± 5.7% vs. (MI) 74.8 ± 4.5% vs. (C) 74.0 ± 5.6%), at posterior-lateral reach ((ACL) 103.2 ± 6.4% vs. (C) 108.5 ± 6.0%) and composite score ((ACL) 93.9 ± 4.4% vs. (MI) 97.9 ± 4.3%) in comparison to the remaining two groups. In the FMS test, the ACL group had significantly lower composite score (12 ± 4 points) compared to the C group (15 ± 2 points). Also, compared to the remaining groups, subjects following ACL reconstruction demonstrated significantly lower performance in the TJA test related to the following elements: thighs do not reach parallel, thighs not equal side-to-side, foot placement not shoulder width apart, technique declines prior to 10 s and lower extremity valgus at landing. The authors have observed that athletes after ACL reconstruction still have deficits in movement patterns or in neuromuscular control despite passing the RTS and being cleared to perform sports. Creating a set of sufficiently sensitive assessment methods may significantly reduce the potential risk of injury due to the fact that diagnosed and monitored deficits may be treated on an ongoing basis. The authors suggest that individual elements of the Y-balance and TJA tests may be suitable for such specific assessment."

This study aimed to examine the feasibility and effects of velocity-specific exercise compared to isometric exercise on cervical muscle functions and performance in healthy individuals.Thirty healthy adults were randomised to practise either the velocity-specific exercise (VSE, n = 15) or isometric exercise (IE, n = 15) for 6 weeks. Functions and performance of the cervical extensors and flexors were assessed pre- and post-program, by analyzing the peak torque and electromyography during the isokinetic testing, and cross-sectional area of the deep cervical muscles at rest. The self-reported level of difficulty and post-exercise soreness during the exercise were recorded to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the two exercise programs.Both VSE and IE exercises resulted in significant improvement of the muscle functions and performance while there were no between-group differences at reassessment of the (a) cross-sectional area of longus colli and semispinalis capitis; (b) EMG amplitude in sternocleidomastoid and cervical erector spinae, and (c) peak torque values. Further analysis revealed that degree of correlation between extension torque and EMG amplitude of cervical erector spinae increased in both groups. However, significant correlation was found only in VSE group post-program. There were no significant differences for the level of difficulty and post-exercise soreness found between two groups.Both velocity-specific and isometric exercises significantly promoted cervical muscle functions and performance. The present study confirms that velocity-specific exercise can be practised safely and it also contributes to a greater enhancement in neuromuscular efficiency of the cervical extensors. These findings indicate that the velocity-specific exercise can be considered as a safe alternative for training of the cervical muscles. Further study is recommended to examine its benefit and application for promoting the muscle functions and recovery in symptomatic individuals."

There are studies that intra graft tunnel Bone Marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) or intra graft tunnel Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) accelerated graft tunnel healing. This study aimed to investigate the effect of using BMSCs+VEGF injected intra-articular on graft tunnel healing. We reconstructed the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of 12 rabbits using an autograft hamstring tendon with and without intra-articular BMSCs+VEGF. Histological evaluation was done at 3 and 6 weeks after ACL reconstruction. On the surface between the graft and the bone tunnel obtained collagen fiber thickness or Sharpey fiber is significantly more than the control group (p&lt; 0.05) in the evaluation of 3 weeks and 6 weeks either side of the tibia and the femur. To evaluate the progression of the treatment, treatment group and control group gained progression had significantly when compared to 3 weeks and 6 weeks. It can be concluded that intra-articular injection of VEGF+BMSCs can accelerate the integration of the graft tunnel from histology evaluation on 3 and 6 weeks."

This discipline requires competency in algebra, trigonometry, and physics, which is particularly challenging for many students pursuing an undergraduate degree in kinesiology. This paper presents the development and implementation of a biomechanics instructional approach for kinesiology undergraduate students using active-experimental learning sections. Focused on integrating acquired knowledge and applied real-life examples via hands-on experiences, the students work in small groups to complete five lab activities and a final project. Lab activities are designed to match concepts in the lectures as well as advance students’ skills in data collection, processing, and analysis. These active and experimental learning approaches offer students the opportunity to gain occupational experience by collecting data and estimating kinematic and kinetic parameters. Students also critically interpret data and gain a solid understanding of methods used to improve the performer's movements. Throughout the semester, students demonstrate improvements in their critical thinking abilities and proficiency in using dedicated biomechanical software and hardware through a series of increasingly challenging lab activities. They also apply the learned skills in their final project, where they choose and analyze a unique movement for injury prevention and/or performance improvement. In conclusion, the progressive arrangement of these activities successfully guides students to practice and apply their data collection and analytical skills to human movement analysis."

PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases were searched systematically. The criteria for inclusion in the review were as follows: (1) a human adult (≥18 or above); (2) involved in amateur, semi-professional, or professional sports; (3) sports included involved collisions with other humans, apparatus or the environment; (4) interventions included pre- and post-neck muscle strength measures or neck stability measures; (5) outcomes included effects on increasing neck strength in participants and/or injury incidence. Database searches identified 2462 articles. Following title, abstract, and full paper screening, three papers were eligible for inclusion. All of the papers reported information from male participants, two were focused on rugby union, and one on American football. Two of the included studies found a significant improvement in isometric neck strength following intervention. None of the studies reported any impact of neck strengthening exercises on cervical spine injuries. This review has shown that there is currently a lack of evidence to support the use of neck strengthening interventions in reducing impact injury risk in adult populations who participate in sport."

However, the underlying mechanisms whereby repeated long-term sub-concussion induces cerebral structural and neurobehavioural changes are currently unknown. Here, we utilised an established rat model to investigate the effects of repeated sub-concussion on size of lateral ventricles, cerebrovascular blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and biochemical distribution. Following repeated sub-concussion for 2 weeks, the rats showed significantly enlarged lateral ventricles compared with the rats receiving sham-only procedure. The sub-concussive rats also presented significant BBB dysfunction in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, whilst neuromotor function assessed by beamwalk and rotarod tests were comparable to the sham rats. Immunofluorescent and spectroscopic microscopy analyses revealed no significant changes in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, lipid distribution or protein aggregation, within the hippocampus and cortex. These data collectively indicate that repeated sub-concussion for 2 weeks induce significant ventriculomegaly and BBB disruption, preceding neuromotor deficits."

Thirty-seven male athletes from different sports participated to determine if there are differences due to the influences of fatigue and sports modality. VO2max, vVO2max, and TLimvVO2max were measured to determine maximum individual fatigue intolerance point with two preliminary test sessions. H/Q data analyzed were for angular velocities of 180°/s. H/QFatigue calculated using the moment developed in repetitions 48-50 was significantly greater than other conventional methods (p&amp;lt;0.001). Significant differences were apparent among new and conventional methods (H/QRight48,49,50:1.20–1.24 vs. H/QCR: 0.57–0.62; p&amp;lt;0.05) and (H/QLeft48,49,50:1.17–1.34 vs. H/QCR: 0.53–0.55; p&amp;lt;0.001), respectively.

However, the validation of this study protocol is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the validity of injury surveillance in men’s professional team sports based on media reports. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, the validity of media-data-relating injuries was investigated in participating teams of the highest two German divisions in men’s professional basketball (BB) and handball (HB) in the season 2018/2019. Injury protocols completed by the team physicians were compared to those of sports media injury reports. Results The study population was composed of 133 athletes (54 BB and 79 HB). Of 343 injuries reported by the team physicians, 151 (44%) could be identified by means of sports media reports. Severe injuries ( n = 75, 72%) were reported more likely in sports media compared to less severe injuries ( n = 76, 32%, p &lt; 0.00001). Odds ratio (OR) was 5.33 (95% CI 3.22–8.82). No differences regarding injury reporting could be seen between the two team sports. Conclusion For severe injuries, media analysis may be a sufficient method for data collection in popular men’s professional ball sports. An underestimation of true injury prevalence lies within the range of previous reported investigations concerning the validation of injury surveillance methods. Non-severe injuries could not be verified via media analysis in professional handball and basketball."

The incidence of ACL injury has continued to increase, with most patients opting for surgery to improve stability as well as permit a return to sport. Traditional methods of ACL reconstruction can achieve this but are not without their problems, including graft rupture, residual laxity, and donor-site morbidity. There is therefore a requirement for further research into newer, innovative surgical techniques to help improve complication rates. This article describes, with video illustration, ACL reconstruction using a reduced-size bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft with suture tape augmentation. The augmentation acts as a stabilizer during the early stages of graft incorporation while resisting against reinjury during an accelerated recovery. The ability to use a reduced-size graft decreases the donor-site burden, and retention of residual native ACL tissue, when possible, may help with proprioception."
https://openalex.org/W3119426896,The effect of fatigue on asymmetry between lower limbs in functional performances in elite child taekwondo athletes,2021-01-09,2021,article,"Inter-limb asymmetry above a certain threshold in functional performance indicates increased injury risk in sports. Fatigue has been found to increase bilateral asymmetry in lower-limb jumping performance among high-school and adult athletes, whereas this impact has not been examined in child athletes. This study aimed to examine the effect of fatigue on inter-limb asymmetry in functional performances in elite Taekwondo athletes aged between 9 and 11 years. Performance of single-leg jumps, Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and muscle (hamstring and gastrocnemius) flexibility were measured for 13 elite male child Taekwondo athletes (aged 9.85 ± 0.80 years) at both the rested and fatigued states to examine the inter-limb asymmetry. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to examine for difference and the interaction between limb (dominant, non-dominant leg) and state (rested, fatigued state) for each test. Paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the asymmetry magnitude at the rested vs. fatigued state for each test, and the variation of performance post fatigue in the dominant vs. non-dominant leg when appropriate. The inter-limb asymmetry in triple-hop distance significantly (p = 0.046) increased with fatigue, whereas the asymmetry significantly (p = 0.004) decreased with fatigue in anterior (ANT) reach distance in SEBT. A significant (p = 0.027) limb by state interaction was shown for posterolateral (PL) reach distance in SEBT, wherein a significant (p = 0.005) bilateral difference was only shown at the rested state. The PL reach distance showed a significantly greater decrease (p = 0.028) post fatigue when using the dominant leg for support compared to using the non-dominant leg. Fatigue significantly impacts inter-limb asymmetry in jump performances and dynamic balance for child athletes, while the variation of inter-limb asymmetry post fatigue may be different across tests. For the purpose of injury prevention, practitioners should consider assessing the inter-limb asymmetry for children at both the rested and fatigued state and be mindful of the fatigue response of each leg in functional tests."

To explore the association of the types of ACL tear (complete and partial) and side of injury (dominant vs nondominate) with types of playing surfaces, sports, shoes, and mechanism of injuries as well as to determine whether higher levels of fatigue and physical fitness are risk factors for complete ACL tear. This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire to collect information from young male adults with a confirmed ACL injury who were attending rehabilitation programs. The outcomes of interest were patterns of ACL injury, levels of fatigue before the injury on a 0 to 10 scale, and levels of physical fitness (hours per week). Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to assess the differences between groups, while the odds ratios were calculated to evaluate risk factors for complete ACL tear. One hundred thirteen young male adults with a confirmed ACL injury were enrolled. Most of the reported ACL injuries in this study were complete tear (80.5%) and occurred more frequently in the dominant leg (74.6%) due to noncontact mechanism (63.6%). More ACL injuries happened while playing soccer (97.2%) on artificial turf (53.3%). The level of fatigue before ACL injury was significantly higher in partial ACL tear injuries compared to complete ACL tear injuries ( P = .014). For every 1-point increase in the level of fatigue on a 0–10 scale, there was a 25% reduction in complete ACL injury risk ( P = .023). The pattern of ACL types of tear and side of injury varies in different playing surfaces and mechanisms of injuries. Higher levels of fatigue seem to be associated with a partial tear of the ACL and reduction of a complete ACL tear risk factor."

Anterior GHJ instability is especially frequent among young, athletic populations during contact sporting events. Many first time dislocators can be managed non-operatively with a period of immobilization and rehabilitation, however certain patient populations are at higher risk for recurrent instability and may require surgical intervention for adequate stabilization. Determination of the optimal treatment strategy should be made on a case-by-case basis while weighing both patient specific factors and injury patterns (i.e., bone loss). The purpose of this review is to describe the relevant anatomical stabilizers of the GHJ, risk factors for recurrent instability including bony lesions, indications for arthroscopic vs open surgical management, clinical history and physical examination techniques, imaging modalities, and pearls/pitfalls of arthroscopic soft-tissue stabilization for anterior glenohumeral instability."
https://openalex.org/W3119641418,Predicting Temporal Gait Kinematics: Anthropometric Characteristics and Global Running Pattern Matter,2021-01-08,2021,article,"Equations predicting stride frequency (SF) and duty factor (DF) solely based on running speed have been proposed. However, for a given speed, kinematics vary depending on the global running pattern (GRP), i.e., the overall individual movement while running, which depends on the vertical oscillation of the head, antero-posterior motion of the elbows, vertical pelvis position at ground contact, antero-posterior foot position at ground contact, and strike pattern. Hence, we first verified the validity of the aforementioned equations while accounting for GRP. Kinematics during three 50-m runs on a track ( n = 20) were used with curve fitting and linear mixed effects models. The percentage of explained variance was increased by ≥133% for DF when taking into account GRP. GRP was negatively related to DF ( p = 0.004) but not to SF ( p = 0.08), invalidating DF equation. Second, we assessed which parameters among anthropometric characteristics, sex, training volume, and GRP could relate to SF and DF in addition to speed, using kinematic data during five 30-s runs on a treadmill ( n = 54). SF and DF linearly increased and quadratically decreased with speed ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), respectively. However, on an individual level, SF was best described using a second-order polynomial equation. SF and DF showed a non-negligible percentage of variance explained by random effects (≥28%). Age and height were positively and negatively related to SF ( p ≤ 0.05), respectively, while GRP was negatively related to DF ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), making them key parameters to estimate SF and DF, respectively, in addition to speed."

The intervention was lateral jump until exhaustion. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to extract muscle synergies from electromyography. Subsequently, to compare the muscle synergies, a scalar product that evaluates the coincidence of synergies was calculated. Three muscle synergies were extracted before and after the intervention from the NMF analysis. In accordance with the evaluation of the scalar product, these synergies were the same before and after the intervention. One of these synergies that engaged the internal oblique/transversus abdominis, rectus femoris, and adductor muscle was activated from before landing to midstance during sidestep motion; therefore, this synergy is thought to suppress excessive hip abduction. However, the activation timing of this synergy was delayed after the intervention ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.028</mn></math> , effect size: 0.54, Wilcoxon test).

The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a specific pictorial perceived exertion scale for soccer players (indoor, field, and beach soccer) called GOAL Scale. The pictorial GOAL Scale (six drawings; 1 “low exertion” to 6 “exhaustion”) was validated for twenty under-17 soccer players (16.4 ± 0.68 years; 175.4 ± 9 cm; 66.4 ± 7.7 kg; % fat mass 12.4 ± 3.3). In the validation phase, the athletes were evaluated in a progressive protocol involving stimuluses of 3 min with 1 min for the rest into the stages until the voluntary exhaustion in Maximal Cardiopulmonary Effort Test (MCET), and in the Yo Yo Intermittent Recovery Test – Level 1 (Yo-Yo). The RPE identified by the GOL Scale, by the Borg Scale 6 – 20 and by the Cavasini Scale, as well as the heart rate (HR), perceptual of the heart rate (%HR max ) and the blood lactate concentration ([La]) were immediately evaluated after each stage of both tests. Spearman’s correlation coefficient ( p &amp;lt; 0.05) was used. Construct scale validity was examined by regressing GOAL Scale against Borg Scale 6 – 20 and Cavasini Scale and concurrent scale validity was investigated by regressing GOAL Scale against HR, beats/min and blood lactate concentration (mmol/L) during two progressive tests. There was a significant correlation values of the GOAL Scale with Borg Scale ( r = 0.93; r = 0.88), Cavasini Scale ( r = 0.91; r = 0.90), %HR max ( r = 0.91; r = 0,86), HR ( r = 0.87; r = 0.83) and lactate ( r = 0.68; r = 0.83) during tests (Maximal Incremental Cardiopulmonary Test and Yo-Yo test, respectively). The results evidenced concurrent and construct validity of the GOAL Scale across a wide range of exercise intensity. The absence of verbal anchors makes the use of this instrument to soccer, futsal and beach soccer athletes of different languages and different literacy levels possible."

Our primary aim was to determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a physiotherapist-guided intervention for individuals 1-year post-ACLR with persistent symptoms. Our secondary aim was to determine if a worthwhile treatment effect could be observed for the lower-limb focussed intervention (compared to the trunk-focussed intervention), for improvement in knee-related QoL, symptoms, and function. Design : Participant- and assessor-blinded, pilot feasibility RCT. Methods : Participant eligibility criteria: i) 12-15 months post-ACLR; ii) &lt;87.5/100 on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) QoL subscale; and either a one-leg rise test &lt;22 repetitions, single-hop &lt;90% limb symmetry; or Anterior Knee Pain Scale &lt;87/100. Participants were randomised to lower-limb or trunk-focussed focussed exercise and education.. Both interventions involved 8 face-to-face physiotherapy sessions over 16-weeks. Feasibility was assessed by eligibility rate (&gt;1 in 3 screened), recruitment rate (&gt; 4 participants/month), retention (&lt;20% drop-out), physiotherapy attendance and unsupervised exercise adherence (&gt;80%). Between-group differences for knee-related QoL (KOOS-QoL, ACL-QoL), symptoms (KOOS-Pain, KOOS-Symptoms), and function (KOOS-Sport, functional performance tests) were used to verify that the worthwhile effect (greater than the minimal detectable change for each measure) was contained within the 95% confidence interval. Results : 47% of those screened were eligible, and 27 participants (3 participants/month; 48% men, 34±12 years) were randomised. Two did not commence treatment, and two were lost to follow-up (16% drop-out). Physiotherapy attendance was &gt;80% for both groups but reported adherence to unsupervised exercise was low (&lt;55%). Both interventions had potentially worthwhile effects for KOOS-QoL and ACL-QoL, while the lower-limb focussed intervention had potentially greater effects for KOOS-Sport, KOOS-Pain, and functional performance. Conclusions : A larger-scale RCT is warranted. All feasibility criteria were met, or reasonable recommendations could be made to achieve the criteria in future trials . Strategies to increase recruitment rate and exercise adherence are required. The potential worthwhile effects for knee-related QoL, symptoms, and function indicates a fully-powered RCT may detect a clinically meaningful effect.

Higher bilateral differences were detected for flexors (H:H = 7.94-11.47 %, Q:Q = 7.97-9.29 %) compared to extensors. Our study showed that 17-year-old players have levels of strength similar to U19 players. A higher bilateral difference of knee flexors than extensors was found, suggesting that more attention should be paid to knee flexors. No effect of laterality was found for strength and strength asymmetries. Future research should also focus on ipsilateral strength ratio in late stage of maturation."

A Meta-Analysis of About 11,000 Knees",2021-01-06,2021,article,"Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) and age-related degeneration (ARD) are stimulants for the development of the fabella in the knee joint. This meta-analysis updates previous studies and reviews on the prevalence of the fabella in OA or ARD knee joints. In addition, it provides a quantitative estimation of the fabellar prevalence in knees having OA and ARD. Methodology: Twenty studies containing data from 11,056 knee joints were utilized in the investigation, consisting of 6,819 knees of individuals with OA (including those with age greater than 40 years) and 4,237 knees of individuals without OA (including less than 40 years of age), respectively. Totally, 2,434 knees of the OA subjects had fabellae (including more than 40 years), while in the non-OA subjects, 844 had fabellae (including less than 40years). The odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) were calculated. Results: The fabellar prevalence was observed to be higher in OA knees, where the risk ratio of developing fabella was 2.55 (2.15-3.02). Compared with this, the risk ratio for the incidence of fabella in ARD knee was 1.71 (1.59-1.85). The bilateral occurrence of fabella was more common than unilateral. The risk of developing fabella in individuals aged less than 40-year was 0.59 which was 41% less than individuals aged more than 40 years. The risk ratio of developing fabella in co-exposure of ARD and OA was 1.84 [1.66, 2.04, 95% CI]. Conclusion: OA and ARD would increase the prevalence of ossified fabella by 84%, thus acting as stimulants or associations and risk factors for ossified fabella."

When the load exceeds its strength, ACL will be damaged or broken. The main therapy for a fractured ACL is the arthroscopic ligament reconstruction technique. Commonly used reconstruction materials are grouped into three categories: autologous tendons, allogeneic tendons and artificial materials. Peroneal longus tendon(PLT) is an autograft, its superficial location and easier access contribute to its increasing application as a new graft substitute in cruciate ligament reconstructions over recent years. Our research is aiming to investigate the functional recovery of the knee joint after anterior cruciate ligament transplantation with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy and its influence on the ankle joint of the donor site. Methods: During the research period of our retrospective analysis from January 2015 to July 2019, the single-bundle double-stranded anatomical reconstruction technique was applied under arthroscopy on 32 patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (consisting of 22 males and 10 females in the 16–45 (31.1 ± 8.6) age bracket, and among them, 18 cases suffered knee injury on the left limb and the other 14 on the right one) within three weeks of their injury, and the graft for the anterior cruciate ligament (fixed with an Endobutton plate on one end and a screw on the other) was the autologous peroneus longus tendon on the ipsilateral limb. The IKDC score, KOOS score and Lysholm score were used to evaluate the functionality of the affected knee joints and the AOFAS score that of the tendons and ankle joints. Results: All patients were followed up for 1 year (14.5 ± 1.6 months). One case developed postoperative knee joint infection but recovered soon following active treatments, and all the patients turned negative in the postoperative Lachman tests and pivot-shift tests. At the last follow-up, IKDC score, KOOS symptom score, KOOS pain score, KOOS functional life score, KOOS sports entertainment score, KOOS life quality score and Lysholm score were 82.1 ± 13.5, 90.8 ± 15.5, 90.4 ± 5.9, 97.8 ± 4.3, 73.7 ± 26, 83.9 ± 18.1 and 87.3 ± 12.0, respectively, showing marked improvements on and statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) from the preoperative figures. The AOFAS score of the affected ankle joints was 94.7 ± 10.8, signifying a good functional recovery. MRI observation one year later showed that the reconstructed ligament had extended continuously to the position satisfying the requirements of anatomical reduction, and the bone tunnels and tendons had healed well. Conclusion: Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with a single-bundle of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon can satisfactorily restore the function of an injured knee joint without a significant impact on the donor ankle joint."

NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four court-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump Repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump Repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step Drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior Drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Panel. Movement completion time, Ground contact time, peak eccentric rate of force development (RFD), peak concentric GRF, peak concentric COM power, eccentric work, and concentric work were measured. The Y Wrap configuration the Tri Panel configuration delivered improvements between 3 and 9% over the Standard Closure depending on the movement tested and variable of interest. The Lace Replacement had mixed results with some improvements and some declines in performance. This study allowed for the mechanical properties of the shoe bottom package to remain consistent across designs to examine if alternative upper configurations could enhance performance. We hypothesise that improved containment and possibly increased proprioception—due to the wrapping fit of the configurations influences these changes in performance. These findings suggest that the design and construction shoe upper is essential to consider in athletic shoe design."

This is mainly due to the recent investments from technology companies that are improving VR systems while increasing consumer access and interest. Amongst many applications of VR, one area that is particularly promising is for pedagogy. The immersive, experiential learning offered by VR provides new training and learning opportunities driven by the latest versions of affordable, highly immersive and easy to use head mounted display (HMD) systems. VR has been tested as a tool for training across diverse settings with varying levels of success in the past. However, there is a lack of recent review studies that investigates the effectiveness, advantages, limitations, and feasibility of using VR HMDs in training. This review aims to investigate the extent to which VR applications are useful in training, specifically for professional skill and safety training contexts. In this paper, we present the results from a systematic review of the effectiveness of VR-based simulation training from the past 30 years. As a secondary aim, the methodological trends of application and practical challenges of implementing VR in training curriculum were also assessed. The results suggest that there is generally high acceptance amongst trainees for VR-based training regardless of the technology limitations, usability challenges and cybersickness. There is evidence that VR is useful for training cognitive skills, such as spatial memory, learning and remembering procedures and psychomotor skills. VR is also found to be a good alternative where on the job training is either impossible or unsafe to implement. However, many training effectiveness studies reviewed lack experimental robustness due to limited study participants and questionable assessment methods. These results map out the current known strengths and weaknesses of VR HMDs and provide insight into required future research areas as the new era of VR HMD’s evolve."
https://openalex.org/W3127600567,Injury Prediction in Competitive Runners With Machine Learning,2021-01-01,2021,article,"Staying injury free is a major factor for success in sports. Although injuries are difficult to forecast, novel technologies and data-science applications could provide important insights. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs.Prediction of injuries was evaluated on a new data set of 74 high-level middle- and long-distance runners, over a period of 7 years. Two analytic approaches were applied. First, the training load from the previous 7 days was expressed as a time series, with each day's training being described by 10 features. These features were a combination of objective data from a global positioning system watch (eg, duration, distance), together with subjective data about the exertion and success of the training. Second, a training week was summarized by 22 aggregate features, and a time window of 3 weeks before the injury was considered.A predictive system based on bagged XGBoost machine-learning models resulted in receiver operating characteristic curves with average areas under the curves of 0.724 and 0.678 for the day and week approaches, respectively. The results of the day approach especially reflect a reasonably high probability that our system makes correct injury predictions.Our machine-learning-based approach predicts a sizable portion of the injuries, in particular when the model is based on training-load data in the days preceding an injury. Overall, these results demonstrate the possible merits of using machine learning to predict injuries and tailor training programs for athletes."
https://openalex.org/W4200214131,Footwear comfort: a systematic search and narrative synthesis of the literature,2021-01-01,2021,review,"Abstract Objective To provide a narrative synthesis of the research literature pertaining to footwear comfort, including definitions, measurement scales, footwear design features, and physiological and psychological factors. Methods A systematic search was conducted which yielded 101 manuscripts. The most relevant manuscripts were selected based on the predetermined subheadings of the review (definitions, measurement scales, footwear design features, and physiological and psychological factors). A narrative synthesis of the findings of the included studies was undertaken. Results The available evidence is highly fragmented and incorporates a wide range of study designs, participants, and assessment approaches, making it challenging to draw strong conclusions or implications for clinical practice. However, it can be broadly concluded that (i) simple visual analog scales may provide a reliable overall assessment of comfort, (ii) well‐fitted, lightweight shoes with soft midsoles and curved rocker‐soles are generally perceived to be most comfortable, and (iii) the influence of sole flexibility, shoe microclimate and insoles is less clear and likely to be more specific to the population, setting and task being performed. Conclusion Footwear comfort is a complex and multifaceted concept that is influenced not only by structural and functional aspects of shoe design, but also task requirements and anatomical and physiological differences between individuals. Further research is required to delineate the contribution of specific shoe features more clearly, and to better understand the interaction between footwear features and individual physiological attributes."

The main structures that can be found are the three popliteomeniscal fascicles (anterior, postero-inferior and postero-superior), the lateral and posterior meniscotibial ligaments, the popliteofibular ligament and the meniscofibular fascicle. These structures can be identified in most cases using magnetic resonance imaging, and their ‘static’ assessment can be performed. Arthroscopic assessment is useful in identifying and testing ‘dynamically’ the integrity of the structures around the popliteal hiatus. Injuries or abnormalities of the popliteal hiatus and its structures could result in meniscal hypermobility and subluxation; however, these injuries are often unrecognized. Possible abnormalities in this region, apart from the well-known bucket-handle meniscal tear, are the Wrisberg Type III discoid meniscus, and meniscal fascicles tears.

https://openalex.org/W3120567709,Youth sport injury research: a narrative review and the potential of interdisciplinarity,2021-01-01,2021,review,"To prevent sports injuries, researchers have aimed to understand injury aetiology from both the natural and social sciences and through applying different methodologies. This research has produced strong disciplinary knowledge and a number of injury prevention programmes. Yet, the injury rate continues to be high, especially in youth sport and youth football. A key reason for the continued high injury rate is the development of injury prevention programmes based on monodisciplinary knowledge that does not account for the complex nature of sport injury aetiology. The purpose of this paper is to consider and outline an interdisciplinary research process to research the complex nature of sport injury aetiology. To support our proposition, we first present a narrative review of existing youth football and youth sport injury research demonstrating an absence of paradigmatic integration across the research areas’ main disciplines of biomedicine, psychology and sociology. We then demonstrate how interdisciplinary research can address the complexity of youth sport injury aetiology. Finally, we introduce the interdisciplinary process we have recently followed in a youth football injury research project. While further research is necessary, particularly regarding the integration of qualitative and quantitative sport injury data, we propose that the pragmatic interdisciplinary research process can be useful for researchers who aim to work across disciplines and paradigms and aim to employ methodological pluralism in their research."

https://openalex.org/W3127067097,Under-exposure to official matches is associated with muscle injury incidence in professional footballers,2021-01-01,2021,article,"External workload from matches is considered one of the most important muscle injury risk factors for football teams. However, there is scarce published evidence to support this belief. This study examined whether a particular profile of external match workload existed prior to a muscle injury. A total of 144 professional football players belonging to 2 teams were monitored over three seasons. For each muscle injury, a profile of external workload variables was determined for 5 to 8 games and expressed as: time playing exposure, total distance (TD) covered and high-speed running (HSR) covered. In addition, acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) was calculated. Sixty players (41.6%) reported a total of 86 muscle injuries during the three seasons. Muscle injuries occurred principally in matches (79.1%), the hamstring being the most affected muscle (44.1%). Injured players displayed substantially lower accumulated exposure time (ES = 0.45), TD (ES = 0.45) and HSR (ES = 0.39) in comparison with uninjured players in the last 5 games prior to injury. Compared to the uninjured players, ACWR for exposure (ES = -0.29/0.02) and running load (ES = -0.24/0.00) did not differ between match 5 and 2 prior to the injury, although uninjured players displayed a substantially greater ACWR in all 3 variables (ES = 0.31/0.35) than injured players in match 1 prior to the injury. Lower playing exposure (minutes played) and associated reduced running distances (TD and HSR) were observed in injured football players. Being under-loaded in official games could be a mediator for muscle injury in this cohort of elite football players."

Based on the use of wireless sensor networks, this paper monitors the traditional national sports activities, provides real‐time feedback on the actual human body conditions in different sports, and finds out the pros and cons of traditional sports and makes improvements. The object proposes a national automated monitoring test, which uses several small sensors in the wireless sensor network to transmit information to monitor many real conditions in the human body during multisport, so as to find out that the national sports exercise is in real life. Experimental results show that in recent years, all ethnic groups have attached great importance to ethnic sports. The 11th Ethnic Minority Games held in 2019 will have 18 competitions, 17 individual events, 131 small events, and 55 ethnic minorities that participated in the joint participation of more than 7000 athletes participating in traditional sports of all nationalities and are the best inheritance and development of national sports."
https://openalex.org/W3216650841,Smart sensor tights: Movement tracking of the lower limbs in football,2021-01-01,2021,article,"Abstract This article presents a novel smart sensor garment with integrated miniaturized inertial measurements units (IMUs) that can be used to monitor lower body kinematics during daily training activities, without the need of extensive technical assistance throughout the measurements. The smart sensor tights enclose five ultra-light sensor modules that measure linear accelerations, angular velocities, and the earth magnetic field in three directions. The modules are located at the pelvis, thighs, and shanks. The garment enables continuous measurement in the field at high sample rates (250 Hz) and the sensors have a large measurement range (32 g, 4,000°/s). They are read out by a central processing unit through an SPI bus, and connected to a centralized battery in the waistband. A fully functioning prototype was built to perform validation studies in a lab setting and in a field setting. In the lab validation study, the IMU data (converted to limb orientation data) were compared with the kinematic data of an optoelectronic measurement system and good validity (CMCs &gt;0.8) was shown. In the field tests, participants experienced the tights as comfortable to wear and they did not feel restricted in their movements. These results show the potential of using the smart sensor tights on a regular base to derive lower limb kinematics in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3210682604,Clinical foot measurements as a proxy for plantar pressure testing in people with diabetes,2021-01-01,2021,article,"Abstract Background High plantar pressures are associated with increased foot ulcer risk in people with diabetes. Identification of high plantar pressures in people with diabetes is clinically challenging due to time and cost constraints of plantar pressure testing. Factors affecting foot biomechanics, including reduced joint range of motion and foot deformity, are implicated in the development of high plantar pressures and may provide a method to clinically identify those at risk of pressure related complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of joint range of motion and foot deformity measures on plantar pressures in a community dwelling group with diabetes. Methods Barefoot (Tekscan HR Mat™) and in‐shoe (Novel Pedar‐X®) plantar pressure variables, weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion, hallux range of motion, lesser toe deformities and hallux abductus (HAV) scale were assessed in 136 adults with diabetes (52.2% male; mean age 68.4 years). Multivariate multiple linear regression was used to assess the effect of the four biomechanical factors plus neuropathy and body mass index on plantar pressure variables. Non‐parametric bootstrapping was employed to determine the difference in plantar pressure variables for participants with two or more foot biomechanical pathologies compared to those with less than two pathologies. Results Almost one third (32%) of the cohort had two or more foot biomechanical pathologies. Participants with two or more foot biomechanical pathologies displayed significant increases in all barefoot plantar pressure regions (except forefoot), compared to those with less than two pathologies. No significant changes were found for the in‐shoe plantar pressure variables. The regression model explains between 9.9% (95%CI: 8.4 to 11.4%) and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.2 to 31%), and between 2.5% (1.0 to 4.0%) and 43.8% (95% CI: 42.5–44.9%), of the variance in the barefoot and in‐shoe plantar pressure variables respectively. Conclusions Participants presenting with two or more factors affecting foot biomechanics displayed higher peak pressures and pressure time integrals in all foot regions compared to those with less than two factors. The tests used in this study could help clinicians detect elevated plantar pressures in people with diabetes and present an opportunity for early preventative interventions."

This scenario hinders not only the scientific studies on some unique SSTs but also the development of novel coaching methods for learning these SSTs. The current paper aims to bridge the gap by establishing a SST terminology system. The system is built based on goal repeatability, selected anatomical &amp; biomechanical parameters, and analyses of 579 attractive goals from international professional tournaments. The results have revealed that there are 43 SSTs existed in current soccer practice. Some SSTs can be identified by preliminary parameters (i.e. anatomical parameters, the ball vertical position at the shot and the hit-point on the ball), but most of them need additional biomechanical examination on the movement control in frontal &amp; transverse planes, jumping control, and trunk orientation at shots in order to identify uniquely. Further, the new SST terminology has disclosed that soccer attractiveness is linked to the diversity, ingenuity and artistry of shots. The most attractive type of scoring awaited by millions of spectators is aerial shots. Lastly, the most important contribution of the new SST terminology system is to help researchers and practitioners launch target-orientated studies that would provide a practical and convincing scientific coach-method, clear definitions, and means to reevaluate and improve SSTs in practice."
https://openalex.org/W3217282039,The activity demands and physiological responses observed in professional ballet: A systematic review,2021-01-01,2021,review,"The aim of this study was to systematically review research into the activity demands and physiological responses observed in professional ballet. PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and ProQuest were searched for original research relating to 1) the session-specific activity demands of professional ballet, 2) the general activity demands of professional ballet, 3) the immediate physiological responses to professional ballet, or 4) the delayed physiological responses to professional ballet. From an initial 7672 studies, 22 met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and a modified Downs and Black Index. Professional ballet is intermittent; however, activity characteristics and intensity vary by session type and company rank. Performances involve high volumes of jumps (5.0 ± 4.9 jumps·min-1), plies (11.7 ± 8.4 plies·min-1), and lifts (men-1.9 ± 3.3 lifts·min-1), which may result in near-maximal metabolic responses. Ballet classes are less metabolically intense than performance during both barre and centre ( 5 h·day-1), but half is spent at intensities below 3 METs. Evidence is mixed regarding the delayed physiological responses to professional ballet; however, metabolic and musculoskeletal adaptations are unlikely to occur from ballet alone. The mean Downs and Black score was 62%. Appraisal tools revealed that a lack of clarity regarding sampling procedures, no power calculation, and a poor quality of statistical analysis were common limitations of the included studies. Given the large working durations and high rates of jumps, plies, and lifts, managing training loads and recovery may be a focus for strategies seeking to optimize dancer health and wellbeing. Ballet companies should provide dancers with opportunities and resources to engage in supplementary physical training. Further research is required into the physical demands of rehearsals and the longitudinal training loads undertaken by professional ballet dancers."

Twenty male athletes (age 20.1±1.6 years) were randomly divided into two groups that completed a volume-equated training program differing only in exercises distribution: a group that completed three weeks of strength followed by three weeks of plyometric training (TT; n=10) and a group that completed six weeks of combined strength and plyometric drills (S+P; n=10). Athletes completed a triple hop test with the dominant (HOPd) and non-dominant leg (HOPnd), a 15 meters sprint, a change of direction speed (CODS) test (i.e. T test), and a 6×30 meters repeated sprint with change of direction for the best (RSCODb) and mean velocity (RSCODm), and the percentage of decrement (%Dec) in sprint time. Moreover, athletes performed a squat test for maximal power. Both strength and jumping training programs were performed two times per week, equated for exercises, frequency, volume, and intensity per session. The TT group completed the strength training volume during the first three weeks, and the plyometric training volume in the last three weeks, while the S+P combined strength and plyometric training during the six weeks. A 2 (group) × 2 (time: pre, post) ANOVA with repeated measures was used for statistical analysis. Analyses revealed significant improvements for the TT and S+P (HOPd: ES=0.91, 10.28 and 16.69%, respectively; HOPnd: ES=0.86, 11.49 and 14.71%, respectively; RSCODb: ES=0.84, 9.23 and 8.34%, respectively; RSCODm: ES=0.89, 8.56 and 7.51%, respectively). In the post-test there were no significant differences between the groups in any variable analyzed. In conclusion, both training approaches were equally effective at improving jumping and repeated sprinting ability. However, only after the S+P training approach a significant improvement in CODS was observed, with more substantial changes in maximal sprinting speed."

There was no loss of consciousness (LOC), and he continued to play initially until a severe headache forced him out of the game. By the end of the game, he had developed new-onset stuttering, as well as more classic concussion symptoms, like fogginess, dizziness, and headache. Unfortunately, since this was an away game, he was not able to be evaluated by his athletic trainer, so he presented to the emergency room that evening. A head CT was negative for acute intracranial pathology. Examination was unremarkable other than the stuttering speech and mildly slowed cognition with noted slowed processing speed and difficulty with word finding. Coordination, gait, reflexes, and sensation were all normal, and cranial nerves were noted to be intact. He presented to the clinic for follow-up the next day and continued to complain of stuttering, as well as frontal headache and other classic concussion symptoms. Detailed neurologic examination was unremarkable except for stuttering and trouble with word finding. Vestibular/ocular-motor screening was attempted but aborted prior to completion because of increased headache and dizziness. He scored a 17/22 on the Postconcussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) and 69/132 for severity, with increased score for dizziness, feeling mentally ""foggy,"" and difficulty concentrating. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was normal. He was instructed to use Tylenol for pain control and to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because of potential risk of bleeding. He was prescribed relative brain and physical rest. Follow-up was arranged in the sports medicine clinic in 4 d. At follow-up, he reported persistent, but mildly improved stuttering. His headache had improved some, but he continued to complain of photophobia and phonophobia. At this time, he also began to endorse depressed mood. His symptom score had increased from 17/22 to 21/22, and severity increased to 90/132, noting new symptoms of depressed mood and photophobia. Examination was notable for improvement in stuttering since the last encounter, but still present, otherwise unchanged from previous examination. He was discharged with instructions to follow-up in the sports medicine clinic in 1 wk and was referred for vestibular physical therapy, behavioral health for anxiety, and depressed mood, a neurosurgeon who also was a member of the concussion treatment team for thoroughness and a second opinion for the patient's family, and speech therapy for further evaluation and treatment of the stuttering. At follow-up, he had noted significant improvement in all symptoms. He was able to speak without stuttering when calm, but stuttering returned when excited or anxious. He continued to endorse photophobia and phonophobia which still induced headaches. He was able to complete one full session of vestibular PT since his previous visit but required numerous breaks because of recurrent headache. PCSS remained at 21/22, but he stated that he felt more like himself and severity improved to 85/132. He was instructed to continue with vestibular PT, behavioral health, speech therapy, and to increase his physical activity in a subsymptom threshold manner. Subsequent follow-up, 6 wk after injury, he noted complete resolution of his stuttering, and all symptoms except headache. He reported that the stuttering had resolved approximately 2 wk prior (approximately 1 month after initial injury). He was seen and evaluated by our concussion colleague in neurosurgery with recommendations to continue with our current treatment regimen. He also had completed one session of speech therapy and was given a prescription for home speech exercises. He also had a brief counseling session with our behavioral therapist and was given some techniques to help cope with anxiety and stress related to his injury. He was discharged with instructions to continue with prescribed therapies and to follow-up in the sports medicine clinic in 2 wk, but was lost to follow-up at this point. Discussion Kutcher and Giza (1) describe concussion as a complex pathophysiologic response to biomechanical forces on the brain. They further describe concussion as a transient constellation of neurologic symptoms that reflect a functional rather than structural injury. They separate signs and symptoms of concussion into four main categories: cognitive/mental status, physical, affect, and sleep. Cognitive changes typically seen are slowed mentation, confusion, difficulty with attention, and many others. Physical symptoms commonly seen include headache, nausea/vomiting, photophobia/phonophobia, dizziness, slurred speech, blurry vision, and incoordination. Depression, anxiety, and emotional lability are common affective disturbances. Sleep disturbances are widely varied. Stuttering, however, is not a commonly described symptom of concussion. Stuttering may be caused by neurogenic factors, psychogenic factors, or a combination of the two, and delineating causative factors is often difficult. Acute onset stuttering has been linked to psychological factors since the early 1900s when Bleumel described ""hysterical"" stuttering (2). A 1997 article from Mayo Clinic looked at psychogenic stuttering in patients with and without neurologic disease and found no significant distinguishing features to differentiate stuttering attributable to neurogenic factors from purely psychogenic factors (3). Some studies have attempted to establish a link between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acute onset stuttering, but most were unable to discern psychogenic from neurogenic causes (2–5). Acute onset stuttering following concussion has not been frequently described. However, a 2017 study describes the ease of finding unofficial reports, mainly forum posts, made by individuals, lending to the idea that postconcussive stuttering may be more common than reported (6). The article suggests that most report onset of stuttering within 24 h, with about half of those reporting onset within 1 h of injury (6). Yeoh et al. (7) claim to be the first to describe acute stuttering following a head injury in the case of a 12-year old boy who developed stuttering after a skateboarding injury with brief LOC. They also noted other cerebellar dysfunctions, including truncal ataxia with a positive Rhomberg and an intention tremor. Brain imaging was normal in this case and the boy had complete resolution of symptoms by the next morning. Fumeya and Hideshima (8) described multiple cases of cerebellar concussion that resulted in speech disturbances. One of their cases reported dysarthric speech that resolved within 48 h, but MRI demonstrated a high intensity signal within the right superior cerebellar peduncle. Another of their cases described explosive and slurred speech that resolved within 1 month, and MRI findings of an abnormal signal intensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere. This patient also was noted to have a skull fracture with a 5-min LOC at the time of injury. Strasberg et al. (9) reported expressive aphasia described as stuttering after an assault associated with LOC and a 14.8-mm subdural hematoma with associated midline shift noted on CT. Stuttering was the only abnormal physical examination finding in this case, and at 4-month follow-up, the patient continued to endorse mild stuttering. Ludlow and Loucks (10) describe speech as a dynamic motor function that incorporates many areas of the brain, including the cerebellum. They continue to explain that neural timing is different in persons who stutter when compared with those with normal speech. They then describe multiple cases of imaging that confirmed brain lesions of various forms associated with acquired stuttering, concluding that there is no particular area of the brain where a lesion is more likely to produce stuttering. However, a high percentage of lesions that produce stuttering are not located within the primary speech and language regions. A 2018 article on acquired stuttering in war veterans found that the risk for developing acquired stuttering was much greater in those with concomitant TBI and posttraumatic stress disorder than either alone (4). Thus, suggesting that the combination of both psychological and physical injuries may contribute significantly to development of acquired stuttering (4). In a systematic review on acquired stuttering comparing neurogenic to psychogenic stuttering they concluded that secondary to the overlap in symptoms, it was unreliable to make the diagnosis based solely on speech pattern characteristics (5). Instead, they suggest that a rapid, favorable response to psychologic treatment, often with resolution after only one to two treatment sessions, may more accurately differentiate psychogenic from neurogenic stuttering (5). Conclusions Stuttering is often multifactorial without clear etiologies. Many cases of reported acute-onset stuttering cannot be fully differentiated from psychological or physical etiology, and likely are a combination of both. Our patient has some similarities to all of the above described cases. However, his MRI was negative for any lesions within the brain. His stuttering was persistent with gradual improvement over approximately 1 month, which is in contrast to many described cases that report abrupt resolution within 24 h to 48 h. Our patient also did not exhibit any ataxia or other problems with coordination that appear to coincide with cerebellar injuries that have been described with imaging suggestive of actual neurological injury. As with most described cases, we feel that there was a significant psychological component involved (and was likely more prominent in our patient than the other cases) and differentiating between the psychogenic and neurogenic contributing causes is extremely difficult if not impossible. However, given the rarity of reported stuttering after concussion or minor TBI, further investigation and utilization of ancillary services is warranted. We feel that our multidisciplinary approach to treatment, enlisting the help of speech therapy, vestibular PT, and behavioral health, may be crucial to facilitating full recovery as promptly as possible. The prompt return to baseline functioning further limits the missed school and athletic time which is imperative for our student athletes."

Methods: The study sample included 26 elite goalball players. The players were randomized into the two groups of experimental (n=13) and control (n=13). Besides, FMS was used to evaluate the study variables in both groups, before and after the eight weeks of training. After the pretest, the experimental group performed the core stability training using a Swiss ball, three days a week for eight weeks; the control group did the usual training. Then, the analysis of covariance at the significant level of 0.05 was used to analyze the obtained data. Results: The results showed a significant difference in the adjusted mean scores of the FMS test between the experimental and control groups (P=0.021). Conclusion: The positive effect of core stability training on the FMS test scores of the motor function in goalball players emphasizes the effectiveness of this training in core stability muscles. Therefore, it is suggested to use core stability training combined with exercises as an effective way to improve movement patterns and prevent injury in goalball players."
https://openalex.org/W3160189377,A cadaveric study on the rate of strain-dependent behavior of human anterior cruciate ligament,2021-01-01,2021,article,"Purpose: Failure of anterior cruciate ligament often occurs in young sports personnel hampering their career. Such ACL ruptures are quite prevalent in sports such as soccer during dynamic loading which occurs at more than one rate of loading. In this work, a structural constitutive equation has been used to predict the forces acting on ACL for different rates of loading. Methods: Ligaments with distal femur and proximal tibia were subjected to tensile loading to avoid crushing of tissue ends and slipping at higher rates of strain. Custom designed cylindrical grippers were fabricated to clamp the distal femur and proximal tibial bony sections. To estimate parameters for the model, eighteen fresh cadaveric femur-ACL-tibia complex (FATC) samples were experimented on by pure tensile loading at three orders of rates of strain viz., 0.003, 0.03, and 0.3 s –1 . The experimental force-elongation data was used to obtain parameters for De-Vita and Slaughter’s equation. The model was validated with additional tensile experiments. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated failure stress, Young’s modulus and volumetric strain energy to vary significantly as a function of rate of strain. Midsection failure was observed only in samples tested at 0.03 s–1. Femoral or tibial insertion failure were observed in all other experiments irrespective of rate of strain. Conclusion: Human FATC samples were tensile tested to failure at three rates of strain using custom-designed cylindrical grippers. A structural model was used to model the data for the ACL behaviour in the linear region of loading to predict ligament behaviour during dynamic activities in live subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3125178387,Biomechanical Differences between Successful and Unsuccessful Kicking Pullovers by 10-year-old Children,2021-01-01,2021,article,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the differences between successful and unsuccessful kicking pullovers in elementary school children. Successful (n = 12) and unsuccessful (n = 13) kicking pullovers by elementary school children having an approximate age of 10 years using 1 m high horizontal bars were captured, and sagittal plane analyses at 60 Hz were performed using a rigid body link model. The shoulder joint angles were kept constant in the successful movements, whereas those were steadily flexed in the unsuccessful movements after the take-off. The successful movements had smaller forward velocity of the center of mass (CoM) at takeoff, because of the larger decrease in the forward velocity during the takeoff phase. The angle of the swing leg thigh during the takeoff phase was highly correlated with this change in velocity. In successful movements, the thigh was more downward at touchdown, with the trunk upright and the hip joint of the swing leg largely extended. These results suggest that the downward swing leg in the successful movements allowed for larger and faster swinging during the takeoff phase, resulting in a larger backward reaction force impulse from the ground and decrease in the forward velocity of the CoM. This decreased velocity helps to pull the body towards the bar with upper limb joint torques after the takeoff. Therefore, guiding children to touch down in a posture with the trunk upright and the hip joint of the swing leg fully extended would be effective."

[Participants and Methods] Twenty-three female high school soccer athletes provided concussion history and reported pre-season subjective complaints. K-D testing was performed pre and postseason. During the 10-week season, all injuries, preventing participation in practice or game, were recorded. [Results] Six reported a history of concussion. Of those six, three injuries were reported, including two concussions and a hamstring strain. Baseline K-D scores were worse in athletes that had two or more pre-season subjective factors compared to those that did not have any. Moderate positive correlations were found between a history of concussion and the number of injuries and a history of concussion and K-D post-test scores. [Conclusion] Findings indicate that pre-season subjective factors of neck pain, dizziness and headache, history of concussion, and K-D potentially increased injury risk. Combining pre-season metrics both at baseline and during the course of the season may assist in better injury risk screening in-season or indicate suboptimal function due to cumulative effects."

Optimal management for this type of cyst has not been determined because of its rarity. Here, we report successful treatment of a discal cyst and lumbar disc herniation using full endoscopic surgery in a professional baseball player with a chief complaint of weakness in his left lower leg. He had been treated conservatively but symptoms did not improve. Discography helped us to differentially diagnose discal cyst from other cystic lesions. Conventional surgical treatment would have resulted in considerable loss of baseball playing time for the patient. We opted to perform minimally invasive transforaminal full endoscopic surgery under local anesthesia to treat the discal cyst and lumbar disc herniation simultaneously without resection of bone and ligament handling. We removed the discal cyst and disc herniation, which released tension on the left nerve root at the L5 level, and then performed thermal annuloplasty to avoid recurrence. Postoperative course was good and he returned to play baseball at his original competitive level 3 months later. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of successful full endoscopic surgery for discal cyst and lumbar disc herniation performed simultaneously in a professional baseball player. It can be difficult to decide on the proper treatment for discal cysts, but full endoscopic surgery for symptomatic discal cyst might be one good option especially for elite athletes."

A male team athlete (age 36 years, stature 1.75 m, mass 80.0 kg) performed multiple linear decelerations, following 20 m runs at 50%, 75% and 100% self-perceived effort. Inertial measurement unit sensors were strapped to lower-limb segments and retroreflective markers were adhered to the lower-limbs for 3D optical motion analysis. Ground contact time, foot to centre of mass displacement (foot-COM), peak and minimum angle, mean angular velocity and range of motion at the ankle, knee and hip during the contact phases of each deceleration were determined. Measures were valid if a very large correlation (r ≥ 0.7) and small bias (effect size < 0.6) were evident. Following 50% effort, ground contact time, foot-COM and most hip and knee kinematics were valid. Ground contact time, foot-COM and knee flexion velocity and range of motion were valid following 75% efforts. Ground contact time and knee flexion velocity were valid following 100% effort. Therefore, the inertial measurement unit system tested can be used to assess temporal-spatial parameters during a deceleration regardless of the preceding effort, and hip and knee kinematics following low intensity running."

https://openalex.org/W3202796892,Measurement Space Partitioning for Estimation and Prediction,2021-01-01,2021,article,An important and challenging problem in the evaluation of baseball players is the quantification of batted-ball talent. This problem has traditionally been addressed using linear regression or machine learning methods. We use large sets of trajectory measurements acquired by in-game sensors to show that the predictive value of a batted ball depends on its physical properties. This knowledge is exploited to estimate batted-ball distributions defined over a multidimensional measurement space from observed distributions by using regression parameters that adapt to batted ball properties. This process is central to a new method for estimating batted-ball talent. The domain of the batted-ball distributions is defined by a partition of measurement space that is selected to optimize the accuracy of the estimates. We present examples illustrating facets of the new approach and use a set of experiments to show that the new method generates estimates that are significantly more accurate than those generated using current methods. The new methodology supports the use of fine-grained contextual adjustments and we show that this process further improves the accuracy of the technique.

This study took ten tennis players as an example. The hitting process of the top spinning ball was captured by two PULNIX high-speed cameras. The images were processed by APAS motion analysis system. The results showed that the top spinning ball moved forward while rotating in the hitting process and showed a large attack force after rebounding from the land. In biomechanics, A and B had larger angles of upper limb joints and larger joint speed. The center of gravity was on the right. The knee joint flexed, obtained the reactive force through pedaling and stretching, and transferred the power to the racket. At the moment of hitting, the racket head speed of A and B was the largest, 18.3 m/s and 18.5 m/s, respectively. At the end of the follow-through, the shoulder and elbow angle angles of A and B were small. Larger power was provided to the racket by the rapid internal rotation. The power of hitting the ball should be increased to improve the hitting effect and speed. Corresponding guidance can be provided to players to improve their technical level."

[Participants and Methods] Seven healthy males performed cuttings under four tasks by changing the foot contact position and cutting angle. A three-dimensional motion analysis system and force plates were used for taking measurements. The peak vertical ground reaction force and loading rate were calculated. The pelvic, hip, and knee joint angles were measured at the peak vertical ground reaction force. [Results] The loading rate was significantly higher in the lateral foot contact than in the anterior foot contact when the cutting angle was large. The knee flexion angle at the peak vertical ground reaction force was significantly smaller in the lateral foot contact than in the anterior foot contact when the cutting angle was large, similar to the pelvic forward inclination angle, regardless of the foot contact position. [Conclusion] As the cutting angle increased, the knee flexion and pelvic forward inclination angles decreased, resulting in an increase in the loading rate during cutting with the lateral foot contact. Therefore, an increase in the cutting angle can increase the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury."

https://openalex.org/W3135043372,ACUTE EFFECT OF SPEED TEST ON THE SKIN TEMPERATURE OF ELITE SOCCER PLAYERS,2021-01-01,2021,article,"ABSTRACT Introduction Infrared thermography has been used in several areas, mainly in sports training, and specifically in soccer. Objectives The objectives of the study were to verify the acute effect of a displacement speed test on the skin temperature of elite female soccer players, to observe pre- and post-test thermal asymmetries, and to compare responses in the anterior and posterior regions of lower limbs. Methods Cross-sectional study that evaluated 17 soccer players of the 2018 Brazilian Championship. They were submitted to thermography before and 10 minutes after performing the displacement speed test. Thermographic images were collected using a FLIR® model 8 thermal imager and changes in skin temperature in the anterior and posterior regions of the lower limbs were analyzed, according to the areas of interest. Descriptive statistics were performed and mean and standard deviation of the temperatures of the areas of interest were analyzed. The normality of the data was verified, and then the Student’s t test for normal paired and independent samples and the Mann-Whitney test for non-normal samples were conducted, with p &lt;0.05 being adopted for significance level. Results It was possible to observe that after the test there was an increase in skin temperature in all the regions analyzed, both on the dominant and non-dominant sides (p &lt;0.05). Regarding the analysis of the anterior region, it was possible to observe a higher temperature (p &lt;0.05) in the region of the tibial muscles than in the region of the quadriceps muscles. Conclusion It is concluded that thermography helps to understand the thermal responses of lower limbs after applying the displacement speed test. The study shows that thermographic evaluation can guide the organization of the training session when motor tests have previously been applied, and in the detection of abnormal overloads, helping to prevent injuries.

https://openalex.org/W3187069422,Chronic lateral ankle instability: a current concepts review,2021-01-01,2021,article,"ABSTRACT Injuries to the lateral ankle ligaments are quite common, with a reported incidence of up to 22% of all sports injuries, and 85% of all ankle sprains. Most of these are effectively managed using nonoperative measures in the acute setting. Approximately 20% of patients will, however, develop chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI). Although the anatomy and biomechanics are well documented, more recently, the concepts of the lateral talofibular calcaneal ligament (LTFCL) and microinstability have been described. For those who develop CLAI, a full assessment is mandatory to not only search for correctable risk factors (malalignment), but also to differentiate between functional and mechanical instability. Associated injuries need to be excluded, such as osteochondral lesions of the talus. Rotational ankle instability is a new concept that needs to be considered. Patients who present with CLAI are initially managed conservatively in the form of functional rehabilitation. This management is especially effective in patients with functional instability. Surgery is generally indicated after failed conservative management in patients with objective mechanical instability. The elite athlete is a relative indication to performing surgery early. The choice of surgical procedure is made on an individualised basis, although open anatomical procedures remain the gold standard. Non-anatomical procedures are no longer recommended. Newer minimally invasive and endoscopic techniques show promise in experienced hands but there is only limited evidence to support its use at present. The use of a suture tape as an augment is reserved for specific indications and should not be used routinely.

https://openalex.org/W3212843481,[Retracted] 3D Kinematic Analysis of Intelligent Vision Sensor Image in Football Training,2021-01-01,2021,article,"With its advantages of high precision, noncontact, and high intelligence, intelligent visual sensor detection technology meets the requirements for online detection of motion status and intelligent recognition of motion images during sports activities, and its applications are becoming more and more extensive. In order to deeply explore the feasibility of using intelligent vision sensor technology to analyze the three‐dimensional action of football, this article uses algorithm analysis method, technology summary method, and physical assembly method, collects samples, analyzes the motion model, streamlines the algorithm, and then creates a model based on intelligent visual sensor technology that can analyze the three‐dimensional movement in football training. After the experimental objects are selected, the model is established in the ADM environment. All athletes do a uniform motion, the standard input motion speed is 5 m/s, they all move in the opposite direction relative to their respective coordinate axes, and the motion time is 6 seconds. The results show that the movement curves of the athletes in the three coordinate axis directions are basically the same. When the exercise time is 6 seconds, the coordinate values of the athletes on the three coordinate axes are all 0.992 m. We set six intensities in the experiment: 5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, and 55%. It can be found that as the noise intensity increases from 5% to 45%, the estimation error gradually increases, but as a whole, it is still at a relatively small level. It shows that the algorithm in this paper still has practical significance. It is basically realized that under the guidance of intelligent vision sensor technology, a model can be designed to successfully and efficiently analyze the three‐dimensional movement pattern in training."

Badminton training has received extensive attention in the field of sports. However, there is currently no effective and accurate method for effective analysis of badminton training. In order to solve this problem, this paper combines the training teaching theory and the representation training theory and applies the fuzzy algorithm to construct the fuzzy evaluation model based on the analytic hierarchy process. After the experiment, the test scores of the sports quality of the two groups of badminton special students were improved. Through the screening of the seven functional modes of action, it was found that the special students’ left and right symmetry differences were obvious, the lower limbs were not stable, the core area was weak, and the muscle control ability on both sides of the spine needed to be strengthened."

Methods: Seventeen female basketball players completed the study, 13 to 16 years of age (average of 14 years). Isometric force production of knee extensors, hip abductors, and hip extensors was measured with the hand-held MicroFet3 dynamometer. Reactive strength index was measured with the MuscleLab Ergotest infrared contact grid using depth jumps. The intervention consisted of 6 exercises performed prior to normal basketball practice twice per week for 6 weeks. Results: statistically significant improvements were observed between pre-test and post-test for all force measurements with the exception of right leg hip abduction. Reactive strength index did not significantly change. Conclusions: findings suggest the proposed plyometric training program offers sufficient stimulus to improve lower extremity force production, but not reactive strength in adolescent female athletes. More research is needed comparing the intervention to a control group and to determine an exercise dose necessary to produce changes in reactive strength index.

Adaptation to the environment was the main goal of man in the early stages of civilization. Subsequently, the roles have changed. Society is now actively attacking and changing nature, solving two main tasks - creating a comfortable living environment and ensuring its social status by means of composition and artistic expression. The decoupling of these tasks led to the ramification of the work on the environment into trivial and expositional architecture; this is especially noticeable today. In search of the expressiveness of the image, artistic and tectonic sources have already been exhausted, and architecture is now plot-immanent to itself, ignoring the usual external stimuli of creative ideas. The first violation of traditions made the freedom of form-making legitimate, opened the doors to teratogenesis (implantation of ugliness), and architecture finally turned into an object of plastic experiments that frighten the townspeople with strange structures of mysterious functional purpose. This, of course, is about an expositional architecture, the expressiveness of which sometimes reaches a state that is far from common sense, insulting the existing buildings with a super-scale and absurdity of forms. The architects played too much, not suspecting that the figurative eccentricity of their works testifies not to the triumph of a new aesthetics, but to the twilight of the general culture revealed by architecture."

Current trends in speed training have included the application of non-curved, manual treadmills, as they may enhance peak speeds with less biomechanical stress. A lack of data currently exists in regards to the effectiveness of different settings and peak speed response. Therefore, we proposed to compare peak speeds during different settings of non-curved, manual treadmills. It was hypothesized that as resistance/incline increased, peak sprinting speeds would decrease and vice versa. Methods: Fourteen male professional football players (27.14 ± 3.11 yrs., 183.93 ± 8.52 cm, 100.36 ± 15.60 kg) sprinted at peak speeds during four different incline/resistance bouts. Paired samples T-tests examined differences between bouts, and significance was set at p ≤ 0.008. Results: A significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) existed for peak speeds between each incline/resistance bout (i.e. INC15R8, INC15R5, INC20R3, INC20R1). Conclusions: The observed data differences existed between all bouts, indicating that as resistance and/or incline increased, peak speed decreased. This also indicated that as resistance and/or incline decreased, peak speed increased during sprint bouts in professional football players."
