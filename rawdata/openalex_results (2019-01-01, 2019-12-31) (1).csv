https://openalex.org/W2997687173,Groin Injuries in Soccer: Investigating the Effect of Age on Adductor Muscle Forces,2019-12-31,2019,article,"ABSTRACT Purpose The sudden rise in the injury incidence during adolescence is also evident in soccer-related injuries to the groin. Submaximal passing applies high stress on the adductor muscles and pubic symphysis and is therefore likely to be connected to the occurrence of groin injuries. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to compare hip joint kinematics and adductor muscle forces of different adolescent age groups during submaximal soccer passing. Methods Sixty participants, in four groups, younger than 12, 15, 16. and 23 yr (U12, U15, U16, U23), were analyzed. A Footbonaut, equipped with a 3D motion capture system consisting of 16 cameras, was used to capture kinematic data of short passes. Inverse dynamic analysis was performed to calculate muscle forces of 10 passes of each subject. Results The U15 group showed reduced angular velocities. A rise in hip adductor muscle forces was evident from the youngest group up to the oldest groups. The largest increase (49%) was found between U12 and U15. Lower-limb mass was identified as the best predictor for the increasing adductor force. Conclusions The reduced angular velocities of the U15 and the increase in muscle forces between all age groups were attributed to the increasing segment masses and length. This increases the moments of inertia of the leg segments thereby demanding higher forces to accelerate the segments. Most likely, the stress put upon the adductors apophyses increases during adolescence, as tendons are known to adapt slower than muscles, increasing the risk for overuse injuries. Coaches could use lower-limb mass as an indicator for fast increases in the force demand to identify players who would benefit from a reduced training volume."

The associated high sensitivity of the result on the constraints leads to fundamental problems of a system description based on variables selected in the reductionist tradition. The attempt to compensate the problems by averaging data leads to the neglect of the individual and the moment. However, both is of enormous importance for effective therapy, training, and learning. The theory of differential learning suggests an alternative approach to dealing with these problems. With constantly changing complex whole-body movements, extensive decisions are demanded from the learner, which lead to brain states through an overstraining of the working memory, as it were, as they are also known after mindfulness meditation."

https://openalex.org/W4250116631,Disordered Eating in Collegiate Athletes,2019-12-30,2019,dissertation,"Performance pressures and emphasis on body weight and shape put collegiate athletes at risk for disordered eating. If not identified early, disordered eating behaviors could develop into a clinical eating disorder. While such behaviors are a known problem, prevalence rates are not well established in collegiate athletes. Disordered eating may also relate to physiological changes in athletes, such as body composition and performance, although this relationship is not well understood. The aims of this research were to 1) determine the prevalence of disordered eating risk in NCAA Division I student-athletes and 2) determine if such behaviors are related to baseline and changes in body composition over a competitive season. Athletes (n=58) competing in eight different sports (football, men’s and women’s soccer, women’s basketball, gymnastics, men’s and women’s track and field, and women’s diving), from an urban university, completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) questionnaire and two dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body composition scans, one at preseason and another at postseason. While no risk for disordered eating was found in this sample, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was positively correlated with EAT-26 scores (r=0.661, p=0.038) among female gymnasts. Reasons for these findings are unclear; however, it is thought that the ethnic diversity of the sample played a role in the absence of disordered eating risk in this study. Further research is needed to better understand if ethnicity plays a role in disordered eating risk."
https://openalex.org/W3004918562,Ultrasound elastography as a potential method to evaluate entrapment neuropathies in elite athletes: a mini-review,2019-12-28,2019,review,"Entrapment neuropathies constitute a significant albeit still neglected problem in athletes. Currently available diagnostic options in patients with suspected neuropathies, nerve conduction studies, and magnetic resonance imaging have some drawbacks, mostly related to their invasive character, high cost, and limited availability. This paper reviews published articles documenting the use of ultrasound elastography, a novel technique to determine tissue strain, in the evaluation of nerve stiffness in entrapment neuropathy, and it discusses potential pros and cons of this method in the examination of elite athletes. Based on the review of literature, ultrasound elastography – especially shear wave elastography – seems suitable for the evaluation of entrapment neuropathies in elite athletes. Published evidence from the general population suggests that most common entrapment neuropathies (carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy of the elbow, ulnar tunnel syndrome) are associated with a significant increase in the stiffness of affected nerves, which can be accurately detected with ultrasound elastography. Before adding ultrasound elastography to the armamentarium of diagnostic tests used routinely in athletes, its accuracy in the detection of entrapment neuropathies needs to be verified in this specific group, and the reference values for peripheral nerve strain in sportspersons need to be determined."

Recent studies suggest that changes in brain activity (i.e., functional neuroplasticity) may be related to ACL injury. The purpose of this article is to summarize the available evidence of functional brain plasticity after an ACL injury. A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The terms “brain,” “activity,” “neuroplasticity,” “ACL,” “injury,” and “reconstruction” were used in an electronic search of articles in PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases. Eligible studies included the following criteria: (a) population with ACL injury, (b) a measure of brain activity, and (c) a comparison to the ACL-injured limb (contralateral leg or healthy controls). The search yielded 184 articles from which 24 were included in this review. The effect size of differences in brain activity ranged from small (0.05, ACL-injured vs. noninjured limbs) to large (4.07, ACL-injured vs. healthy control). Moreover, heterogeneity was observed in the methods used to measure brain activity and in the characteristics of the participants included. In conclusion, the evidence summarized in this scoping review supports the notion of functional neuroplastic changes in people with ACL injury. The techniques used to measure brain activity and the presence of possible confounders, as identified and reported in this review, should be considered in future research to increase the level of evidence for functional neuroplasticity following ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W2997630109,Risk accepters and problem solvers: managing risk in the masters Highland Games,2019-12-27,2019,article,"Narratives of ageing are often negative, focussing on later life as a period defined by biological decline. A growing population of older adults (Masters athletes) participating in sport challenge these assumptions. Existing research demonstrates how Masters athletes transcend and challenge dominant discourses of ageing and resist enfeeblement. To do so requires a negotiation with risk, pain and injury. Examining these processes in younger athletes developed within the sociology of sport during the 1990s. This literature explored risk-taking sub-cultures across different sports and between genders. Yet an analysis of how older athletes manage risk has hitherto not taken place. In order to expand this corpus of work to Masters athletes, this article provides a case study of the Masters Highland Games. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 19 athletes aged between 40 and 75, two ideal types that describe approaches to risk taking are proposed. Informed by the ideas of Giddens, these ideal types will demonstrate the variety of ways that resistance relates to risk, pain and injury. This case study demonstrates that some Masters athletes share traits identified in research with younger athletes, such as the acceptance of their practice being inherently risky and the act of normalising pain. However, most Masters athletes exhibit a more problem solving approach that adopts various strategies that manage the risks of ageing."

https://openalex.org/W2995999385,Biomechanical Determinants of the Modified and Traditional 505 Change of Direction Speed Test,2019-12-20,2019,article,"Abstract Dos'Santos, T, McBurnie, A, Thomas, C, Comfort, P, and Jones, PA. Biomechanical determinants of the modified and traditional 505 change of direction speed test. J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1285–1296, 2020—The aim of this study was to investigate the whole-body biomechanical determinants of 180° change of direction (COD) performance. Sixty-one male athletes (age: 20.7 ± 3.8 years, height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m, mass: 74.7 ± 10.0 kg) from multiple sports (soccer, rugby, and cricket) completed 6 trials of the modified and traditional 505 on their right leg, whereby 3D motion and ground reaction force data were collected during the COD. Pearson's and Spearman's correlations were used to explore the relationships between biomechanical variables and COD completion time. Independent t -tests and Hedges' g effect sizes were conducted between faster (top 20) and slower (bottom 20) performers to explore differences in biomechanical variables. Key kinetic and kinematic differences were demonstrated between faster and slower performers with statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.05) and meaningful differences ( g = 0.56–2.70) observed. Faster COD performers displayed greater peak and mean horizontal propulsive forces (PF) in shorter ground contact times, more horizontally orientated peak resultant braking and PFs, greater horizontal to vertical mean and peak braking and PF ratios, greater approach velocities, and displayed greater reductions in velocity over key instances of the COD. In addition, faster performers displayed greater penultimate foot contact (PFC) hip, knee, and ankle dorsi-flexion angles, greater medial trunk lean, and greater internal pelvic and foot rotation. These aforementioned variables were also moderately to very largely ( r or ρ = 0.317–0.795, p ≤ 0.013) associated with faster COD performance. Consequently, practitioners should focus not only on developing their athletes' ability to express force rapidly, but also develop their technical ability to apply force horizontally. In addition, practitioners should consider coaching a 180° turning strategy that emphasizes high PFC triple flexion for center of mass lowering while also encouraging whole-body rotation to effectively align the body toward the exit for faster performance."

A judo expert threw an anthropomorphic test device (the POLAR dummy) five times. Kinematics data were obtained with a high-speed digital video camera. Linear and angular accelerations of the head were measured by accelerometers mounted at the center of gravity of the dummy's head. When Seoi-nage was performed, the dummy fell forward accompanied by contacting the anterior parietal regions of the head to the tatami, and the linear and angular accelerations of most axes reached peak values when the head contacted the tatami. Peak resultant linear and angular accelerations were 20.3 ± 9.8 G and 1890.1 ± 1151.9 rad/s2, respectively (means ± standard deviation). Peak values in linear and angular acceleration did not significantly differ between the three directional axes. Absolute angular accelerations in all axes observed in Seoi-nage were high and the resultant value was approximately equal to the already reported in Ouchi-gari, one of the predominant techniques causing judo-related acute subdural hematoma. However, the remarkable increase of linear acceleration in the longitudinal direction and/or angular acceleration in the sagittal plane, as previously reported in techniques being thrown backward (i.e., Ouchi-gari and Osoto-gari), was not detected. The likely mechanism of acute subdural hematoma caused by Seoi-nage is that a large angular acceleration causes large strains and deformations of the brain surface and subsequent rupture of cortical vessels."

Standardised measurement methods of physical capacity of relevance to young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain are currently not established. The aim of this consensus paper was to provide recommendations for clinical practice and research on standardised measurement methods of physical capacity in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain. Four areas of importance were identified: (1) clinical measures (range of motion, muscle strength, functional impairments), (2) laboratory-based measures (biomechanics and muscle function (muscle activity, size and adiposity)), (3) physical activity, and (4) return to sport/performance. The literature was reviewed, and a summary circulated to the working group to inform discussion at the consensus meeting. The working group developed clinical and research recommendations from the literature review, which were further discussed and modified within the working group at the consensus meeting. These recommendations were then presented to all 38 International Hip-related Pain Research Network (IHiPRN) participants for further discussion, refinement and consensus voting. Therefore, the recommendations voted on were based on a combination of current evidence and expert opinion. The consensus meeting voted on 13 recommendations, six of which were clinically orientated, and seven more research specific. We recommended that clinicians working with young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain assess strength using objective methods of measurement, and clinically assess performance of functional tasks, including walking and running. Physical activity should be quantified using both self-reported and objective measures, and patient expectations of recovery should be quantified prior to treatment. It was recommended that return to physical activity (including sport and occupation) be quantified, and sport-specific activities should be assessed prior to return to sport. The IHiPRN participants were uncertain regarding recommendations for range of motion assessment. Research recommendations were that the measurement properties of range of motion, strength and functional performance tests be investigated, reported and improved in both clinical and research settings. Reporting of movement-related parameters (biomechanics and muscle function) should be standardised and the relationship among movement-related parameters, symptoms, function, quality of life, and intra-articular and imaging findings should be investigated. Quantification of return to physical activity (including sport and occupational demands) is required in future research, and the return to sport continuum should be used. Future research is required to determine the best criteria for rehabilitation progression and return to physical activity following hip-related pain management."

It was hypothesized that participants with chronic repeated incidences of concussions would attempt more approaches to treatment not advocated for by mainstream sports medicine organizations and that perceived efficacy of some under-researched treatments would be comparable to highly supported, evidence-based approaches.Design: Observational, cross-sectional, online survey using Qualtrics XM.Participants: 977 college students (18+) were recruited at a central Illinois university. Outcome Measures: Concussion history, duration of postconcussive symptoms, treatment experience (types, duration, and perceived effectiveness), and subjective cognitive functioning were assessed. Results: Among respondents, 219 (22.4%) reported a history of at least one concussion with 59 (26.7%) reporting concussive symptoms lasting &amp;gt;1 month. The most common treatment sought was mild physical activity (57.1%) followed by cryotherapy (42.9%) and moderate physical activity (42.9%). The same three treatments (in ranked-order) were perceived to be at least somewhat effective for reducing symptoms (94.7%, 92.9%, and 91.9%, respectively). Results also supported hypothesized patterns reflecting less favorable perceptions of memory and mindful attention among those with one or more concussions (relative to those with none). Total treatments sought was associated with higher anxiety, depression, and memory ability.Conclusion: These findings support prior research on the cognitive effects of concussion and offer insight into the potential efficacy of various treatments for improving concussion-related symptoms."

The purpose of this study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on studies that examined the test-retest reliability of isokinetic knee strength measurements in children. This study is important because isokinetic dynamometry is the gold standard for evaluating muscle strength and it allows comparing muscle performance in children. The databases used were PubMed, Web of Science Scopus, and Embase (up to July 26, 2019). Only studies published in English were included in this review. All studies focused on the reliability of isokinetic knees in healthy children or those with cerebral palsy applied to dynamic contractions (concentric or eccentric) and provided measures of strength, reproducibility, ICC, peak torque, or SEM. We found a total of 143 abstracts and examined 94 articles to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. Finally, 10 articles were included in the systematic review and five studies (96 subjects) formed the meta-analysis sample, all of which focused on the reliability of isokinetic knees in the concentric mode. The CAT and QAREL scales were used to assess the quality of the included studies. The meta-analysis revealed high intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) (0.84; p < 0.001; n = 96 subjects) in the flexion and excellent intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC 0.90; p < 0.001; n = 96 subjects) in the extension. Isokinetic dynamometry could be indicated as a method for measuring muscle strength training in children. However, the reviewed studies suggest some methodological issues in isokinetic tests, such as the rest days between testing and retesting, using the same speeds, protocols, and evaluators, and the performance of the subjects, so more research is required."
https://openalex.org/W2996406943,"Place, Ecological Dynamics and Football",2019-12-17,2019,article,"In this review article, I will use the phenomenology of place and read it alongside ecological dynamics theories (EDT) in sport. I will show the many congruences between these two areas of research and use place to support, supplement and show the phenomenological and ontological foundations of ecological dynamics analysis in sports. I show that the findings and principles used in ecological dynamics can be better understood through the work of Australian place phenomenologist Jeff Malpas. Through this relationship between phenomenological philosophy and ecological dynamics theory, I hope to establish a stronger connection between these two diverging fields of research (phenomenological ontology and sport science). Throughout this article, I demonstrate that an understanding of place can provide a widened and phenomenological basis for the understanding of EDT of sport including affordances, constraints, expertise and learning. Specifically, I use the first-person perspective of the phenomenology of place to illustrate a perspective that ecological dynamics theories do not have access due to the nature of their method. As a result, this article augments both the philosophy of place and ecological dynamics theories of sport by orientating them to different views on the same phenomena. Place benefits by being practically applied to sport sciences whereas ecological dynamics benefits by unveiling a new phenomenological perspective, description and ontological grounding to their object of study."

Methods: A total of 2013 athletes (1301 males, 712 females) who had regularly participated in sports for a minimum of three years were included in the study. Screening of the sole was performed using a podoscope as it is a reliable and practical device. The structure of the sole was evaluated with the highly valid Staheli index. Results: A significant relationship was detected between the ages of the athletes, years in sport, branch of sports variables and the prevalence of flat foot. However, no significant relationship was found between the athletes’ gender and the prevalence of flat foot. Conclusion: It is thought that the training regimes, the floor on which the sports is performed and the shoes used in sports had effects on flat foot deformity. Based on our results, we assert that redesigning the competition shoes and using sports shoes with arch support during warm-ups, running and other sportive and educational drills outside the routine activities of the sports branch may be beneficial for foot health."

Pre- and postoperative quantitative measurement of validated survey instruments, symptoms, diagnostic findings and anonymous video descriptions of symptoms in a cohort of 16 patients with CFD and third window syndrome (TWS) symptoms were systematically studied. Study design: Observational analytic case-control study. Setting: Quaternary referral center. Patients: Group 1 had 8 patients (5 children and 3 adults) with CFD and TWS who underwent surgical management using a previously described round window reinforcement technique. Group 2 had 8 patients (2 children and 6 adults) with CFD who did not have surgical intervention. Interventions: The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) were administered preoperatively and postoperatively. In addition, diagnostic findings of comprehensive audiometry, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) thresholds and electrocochleography (ECoG) were studied. Symptoms before and after surgical intervention were compared. Main outcome measures: Pre- vs postoperative DHI, HIT-6 and audiometric data were compared statistically. The thresholds and amplitudes for cVEMP in symptomatic ears, ears with cochlea-facial nerve dehiscence and ears without CFD were compared statistically. Results: There was a highly significant improvement in DHI and HIT-6 at pre- vs postoperative (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). The age range was 12.8 – 52.9 years at the time of surgery (mean=24.7 years). There were 6 females and 2 males. All 8 had a history of trauma before the onset of their symptoms. The mean cVEMP threshold was 75 dB nHL (SD 3.8) for the operated ear and 85.7 dB (SD 10.6) for the unoperated ear. In contrast to superior semicircular canal dehiscence, where most ears have abnormal ECoG findings suggestive of endolymphatic hydrops, only 1 of 8 operated CFD ears (1 of 16 ears) had an abnormal ECoG study. Conclusions: Overall there was a marked improvement in DHI, HIT-6 and symptoms postoperatively. Statistically significant reduction in cVEMP thresholds was observed in patients with radiographic evidence of CFD. Surgical management with round window reinforcement in patients with CFD was associated with improved symptoms and outcomes measures."

Although such devices provide the required computer power, the size or weight of some of them may become a barrier to user performance, mainly when the interaction is by the touch on the screen. Inserted in this context, this research consists of applying a set of subjective experiments in which volunteers use an application that runs on devices with different sizes and weights. These experiments aim to measure how much the type of handheld device influences the performance of the user in Augmented Reality applications. The main contributions of this study are (i) we concluded by subjective experiments that users with previous knowledge of how to interact with a similar AR application or a game are able to improve their performance when the device is larger and (ii) we demonstrated the age of the participant was also a good indicator of the user performance in AR applications."

We studied 312 players enrolled in the ongoing Einstein Soccer Study, a longitudinal study of amateur soccer player in New York City and surrounding areas. At enrollment and two years later, total heading in the prior 12 months (12-mo.) was estimated using an established self-report instrument and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) logistic regression models were employed to test effect modification by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on the association between 12-mo. heading exposure and DTI. We identified a significant interaction of 12-mo heading*BDNF Val66Met genotype on the presence of low Radial Diffusivity, a DTI marker associated with myelination. Only Met (+) players demonstrated significantly reduced odds of low RD (OR (95 % CI): -2.36 (-3.53, -1.19)) associated with the highest vs. lowest quartile of 12-mo heading exposure. BDNF Val66Met (+) soccer players with long-term exposure to high levels of heading exhibit less low Radial Diffusivity, suggesting impaired re-myelination may be a substrate of the previously reported association between heading and poor functional outcomes in soccer players."

Technique is analysed in order to understand the way in which sports skills are performed, thereby providing the basis for improving performance. Lees (2008) classified sport skills as event skills, major skills and minor skills. Event skills represent sporting events themselves. Examples are the long jump in athletics, the ski jump, the springboard dive and the vault in gymnastics. Major skills are most relevant for a sport and are performed repeatedly. Golf swings, rowing strokes, shots in biathlon races and badminton strokes are typical examples. Minor skills are also performed repeatedly, but have less relevance for success. Examples are different kicks in soccer, two-handed backhand shots in tennis, throws in handball and throwing techniques in martial arts. This chapter deals with the qualitative biomechanical analysis of technique, which is most frequently applied in teaching or coaching in order to provide the learners with detailed and appropriate feedback to improve performance."

Although the state-of-the-art fabric-based wearable devices have shown unique advantages in the field of e-textiles, further efforts should be made before achieving “electronic clothing” due to the hard challenge of optimally unifying both promising electrical performance and comfortability in single device. Here, we report an all-fiber tribo-ferroelectric synergistic e-textile with outstanding thermal-moisture comfortability. Owing to a tribo-ferroelectric synergistic effect introduced by ferroelectric polymer nanofibers, the maximum peak power density of the e-textile reaches 5.2 W m −2 under low frequency motion, which is 7 times that of the state-of-the-art breathable triboelectric textiles. Electronic nanofiber materials form hierarchical networks in the e-textile hence lead to moisture wicking, which contributes to outstanding thermal-moisture comfortability of the e-textile. The all-fiber electronics is reliable in complicated real-life situation. Therefore, it is an idea prototypical example for electronic clothing."

An overview of the effects of plyometric training on soccer-specific outcomes in adult male soccer players is not available yet.To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of plyometric training on soccer-specific outcome measures in adult male soccer players and to identify which programs are most effective.PubMed, Embase/Medline, Cochrane, PEDro, and Scopus were searched. Extensive quality and risk of bias assessments were performed using the Cochrane ROBINS 2.0 for randomized trials. A random effects meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3.Seventeen randomized trials were included in the meta-analysis. The impact of plyometric training on strength, jump height, sprint speed, agility, and endurance was assessed. Only jump height, 20-m sprint speed, and endurance were significantly improved by plyometric training in soccer players. Results of the risk of bias assessment of the included studies resulted in overall scores of some concerns for risk of bias and high risk of bias.This review and meta-analysis showed that plyometric training improved jump height, 20-m sprint speed, and endurance, but not strength, sprint speed over other distances, or agility in male adult soccer players. However, the low quality of the included studies and substantial heterogeneity means that results need to be interpreted with caution. Future high-quality research should indicate whether or not plyometric training can be used to improve soccer-specific outcomes and thereby enhance performance."

I differentiate between practical intentions and general intentions not in terms of their function or timing but in terms of their content. I also highlight a distinction between practical intentions and other control mechanisms that are required to explain skilled action. I’ll maintain that all intentions, general and practical, have the function specifying (and thus guiding according to those specifications), sustaining, and structuring action but that several functions that have been attributed to proximal intentions are actually implemented by other control mechanisms that are not themselves best identified as intentions. Specifically, I will claim that practical intentions do not initiate, monitor, specify or guide the fine-grained, online, kinematic aspects of action. Finally, I suggest that the way in which practical and general intentions should be differentiated is in terms of their content, where general intentions specify the overall goal, outcome, or end of an action as it is conceived of by the agent at a time, and practical intentions determine the means to that end. I conclude by providing empirical evidence to support this way of characterizing the intentions that “interface” with the mechanisms of motor control. Though this discussion has repercussions for action in general, I will limit my discussion to cases of skill."

Twenty-eight days of retrospective training data prior to non-contact injuries (n=264) were collated from 192 professional soccer players. Each injury tissue type (muscle, tendon and ligament) and severity (days missed) were categorised by medical staff. Training data were recorded using global positioning system (GPS) devices for total distance (TD), high speed distance (HSD,>5.5 m/s-1), and sprint distance (SPR,>7.0 m/s-1). Accumulated 1, 2, 3, 4-weekly loads and acute:chronic workload ratios (ACWR) (coupled, uncoupled and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) approaches) were calculated. Workload variables and injury tissue type were compared using a one-way ANOVA. The association between workload variables and injury severity were examined using a bivariate correlation. There were no differences in accumulated weekly loads and ACWR calculations between muscle, ligament, and tendon injuries (P>0.05). Correlations between each workload variable and injury severity highlighted no significant associations (P>0.05). The present findings suggest that the ability of accumulated weekly workload or ACWR methods to differentiate between injury type and injury severity are limited using the present variables."

At higher values ​​mean higher quality of execution. The lower limb functional asymmetry (FA) is monitored to control the athlete's injury risk. This study aims to examine the correlation between the FMS score and strength asymmetry in professional soccer players (PSP). Methods: n=31 PSP (age:22.2±4.6; weight:74.3±10,1kg; height:176.1±8.7cm), n=4 were excluded for joint or muscle injury in the last 18 months. The FMS protocol identifies athletes at risk of injury when the total score is≤14. The Hop Test (HT), Side Hop Test (SH) and Crossover Hop Test (CH) are considered a valid assessment of the single lower limb FA. Results: It revealed a significant inverse correlation between FMS score and HT (r = -0.56, p&lt;0.01), between FMS score and SH asymmetry percentage (r =-0.74, p&lt;0.01) and the CH asymmetry percentage (r=-0.60, p&lt;0.01). Significant correlation were found between HT asymmetry and SH asymmetry (r= -0.54, p&lt;0.01), CH asymmetry (r=-0.59, p&lt;0.01); significant correlation were found between SH asymmetry and CH asymmetry (r= -0.76, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Low scores in the FMS test are correlated with high levels lower limb strength asymmetry in the soccer player; it can be assumed that movement accuracy influences jump performance. In the soccer players, the lower limb strength asymmetries are observed on the jumps performed in different planes and in different tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2993270369,Rehabilitation of Lateral Ankle Sprains in Sports,2019-12-02,2019,book-chapter,"Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries in athletes. The rate of injury is as high as 70%. The most commonly involved ligament is the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), followed by the calcaneofibular (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL). The common mechanism of injury is inversion with excessive ankle supination in forced plantarflexion when the ankle joint is in its most unstable position. There are three grades of ankle sprains: Grade I, mild with an incomplete tear of ATFL; Grade II, moderate with a complete tear of ATFL with or without an incomplete tear of CFL; and Grade III, severe with complete tear of ATFL and CFL. Grades I and II respond well to functional treatment. Functional treatment includes RICE protocol, i.e., rest, ice, compression, and elevation. It also includes range of motion and strengthening exercises, proprioceptive training, and sports-specific exercises. Bracing and taping of the ankle joint help in preventing the sprains and also reduce the recurrence of the injury. Grade III ankle injury may be treated with surgery if the symptoms persist post functional treatment. The guidelines provided for the treatment of ankle sprains are of general validity, but each athlete is different with different needs. Hence, a personalized exercise protocol should be followed to achieve best results."
https://openalex.org/W2995710552,The Challenge of Applying and Undertaking Research in Female Sport,2019-12-01,2019,article,"In recent years there has been an exponential rise in the professionalism and success of female sports. Practitioners (e.g., sport science professionals) aim to apply evidence-informed approaches to optimise athlete performance and well-being. Evidence-informed practices should be derived from research literature. Given the lack of research on elite female athletes, this is challenging at present. This limits the ability to adopt an evidence-informed approach when working in female sports, and as such, we are likely failing to maximize the performance potential of female athletes. This article discusses the challenges of applying an evidence base derived from male athletes to female athletes. A conceptual framework is presented, which depicts the need to question the current (male) evidence base due to the differences of the ""female athlete"" and the ""female sporting environment,"" which pose a number of challenges for practitioners working in the field. Until a comparable applied sport science research evidence base is established in female athletes, evidence-informed approaches will remain a challenge for those working in female sport."
https://openalex.org/W2989584286,Joint pain and osteoarthritis in former recreational and elite cricketers,2019-12-01,2019,article,"Abstract Background Sport participants are at increased risk of joint pain and osteoarthritis. A better understanding of factors associated with joint pain and osteoarthritis in this population could inform the development of strategies to optimise their long-term joint health. The purpose of the study was to describe the prevalence of joint pain and osteoarthritis in former cricketers, and determine whether playing position, playing standard (i.e. elite or recreational standard) and length-of-play are associated with region-specific joint pain. Methods The data were from the Cricket Health and Wellbeing Study (CHWS), a cohort of 2294 current and former cricketers (played ≥1 season) in England and Wales. For this study, eligible individuals had to be aged ≥30 years and be a former cricket participant. Joint pain was defined as region-specific (hip/knee/ankle/shoulder/hand/back) pain on most days of the last month. Osteoarthritis was defined as joint-specific doctor-diagnosed osteoarthritis. Logistic regression was used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted (for history of joint injury resulting in &gt; 4 weeks of reduced activity +/− age) odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results 846 individuals from the CHWS were former cricketers aged ≥30 years (3% female, aged median 62(IQR 54–69) years, 62% played cricket recreationally, median 33(IQR 21–41) cricket seasons). One-in-two (48%) reported joint pain and 38% had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Joint pain and OA were most common in the knee (23% pain, 22% osteoarthritis), followed by the back (14% pain, 10% osteoarthritis) and hand (12% pain, 6% osteoarthritis). After adjusting for injury, bowlers had greater odds of shoulder pain (OR (95% CI) 3.1(1.3, 7.4)) and back pain (3.6(1.8, 7.4)), and all-rounders had greater odds of knee (1.7(1.0, 2.7)) and back pain (2.1(1.0, 4.2)), compared to batters. Former elite cricketers had greater odds of hand pain (1.6(1.0, 2.5)) than former recreational cricketers. Playing standard was not related to pain at other sites, and length-of-play was not associated with joint pain in former cricketers. Conclusions Every second former cricketer experienced joint pain on most days of the last month, and more than one in three had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Compared with batters, bowlers had higher odds of shoulder and back pain and all-rounders had higher odds of back and knee pain. Elite cricket participation was only related to higher odds of hand pain compared with recreational cricket participation."

This asymmetry is related to leg dominance, which has been associated with increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Therefore, potential biomechanical differences between legs are important. However, little attention has been paid to the biomechanical details of leg dominance. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the relationship between leg dominance and knee biomechanics in females with different activity level during dynamic athletic tasks. Methods A total of 23 female collegiate (mean age = 19.6 ± 1.4 years, mean body mass index = 21.5 ± 0.9) and 19 recreational athletes (mean age = 20.7 ± 1.1 years, mean body mass index = 20.5 ± 1.7) were enrolled. Tegner activity scores of the collegiate and recreational athletes were 9 and 7, respectively. Knee kinematic and kinetic asymmetries between the dominant (DL) and non-dominant (NDL) legs during the landing phase of drop vertical jump (DVJ) were assessed using three-dimensional motion analysis in collegiate and recreational athletes separately. Statistical comparison was done using two-tailed paired t test between DL and NDL in each athlete. Results The peak knee abduction angle was significantly larger on the DL than on the NDL in collegiate athletes. Knee abduction angle at initial contact (IC), peak knee abduction angle, knee internal rotation angle at IC, and peak knee internal rotation angle were significantly larger on the NDL than on the DL in recreational athletes. Moreover, peak knee abduction moment within 40 ms from IC was larger on the NDL than on the DL in recreational athletes, while the moment was not significantly different in collegiate athletes. Conclusions From the present study, the relationship between leg dominance and knee biomechanics was totally different in females with different activity level. Specifically, asymmetry of the knee abduction angle between limbs was opposite between female recreational and collegiate athletes. According to previous literatures, abduction and internal rotation angles as well as abduction moment were key issues for mechanism of non-contact ACL injury. Therefore, the NDL in female recreational athletes was associated with increased risk of ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W2997136131,A survey of mathematical models of human performance using power and energy,2019-12-01,2019,review,"Abstract The ability to predict the systematic decrease of power during physical exertion gives valuable insights into health, performance, and injury. This review surveys the research of power-based models of fatigue and recovery within the area of human performance. Upon a thorough review of available literature, it is observed that the two-parameter critical power model is most popular due to its simplicity. This two-parameter model is a hyperbolic relationship between power and time with critical power as the power-asymptote and the curvature constant denoted by W ′. Critical power (CP) is a theoretical power output that can be sustained indefinitely by an individual, and the curvature constant ( W ′) represents the amount of work that can be done above CP. Different methods and models have been validated to determine CP and W ′, most of which are algebraic manipulations of the two-parameter model. The models yield different CP and W ′ estimates for the same data depending on the regression fit and rounding off approximations. These estimates, at the subject level, have an inherent day-to-day variability called intra-individual variability (IIV) associated with them, which is not captured by any of the existing methods. This calls for a need for new methods to arrive at the IIV associated with CP and W ′. Furthermore, existing models focus on the expenditure of W ′ for efforts above CP and do not model its recovery in the sub-CP domain. Thus, there is a need for methods and models that account for (i) the IIV to measure the effectiveness of individual training prescriptions and (ii) the recovery of W ′ to aid human performance optimization."

The damage mainly occurs in ligament fibers, but MCL avulsion fracture is extremely rare and only a few reports have been published.Herein, we present a healthy 21-year-old man with an avulsion fracture of the MCL of the right knee sustained during snowboarding.Clinical and radiographic findings confirmed the presence of an avulsion fracture at the proximal attachment of the MCL, combined with complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture.The patient underwent single-stage ACL, PCL reconstruction, and MCL repair.Two weeks after the surgery, the patient developed heterotopic ossification (HO) at the medial side of the knee, HO tended to be stable and mature at the 3-month follow-up examination. One year after the operation, the patient's knee was fully functional, stable, and pain free.Femoral attachment avulsion fracture of the MCL is in contrast to common isolated MCL injuries. Early surgical repair is advocated for the greatest benefit. Orthopedic surgeons should keep the potential complication HO in mind and develop rational strategies for HO prevention and treatment."

Lesions to the hamstrings caused by indirect mechanisms represent the most common muscle lesion in football (its incidence increases each year) with a high rate of recurrence. The aim was to evaluate whether the application of percutaneous needle electrolysis and a program of functional exercise decreases the times for return to competition after an injury to the hamstrings in athletes, and to compare performance data of subjects during competition before and after the injury. Methods A case series. Two professional football players, belonging to a first league team in Spain with a grade 2 lesion in the semitendinosus muscle on the proximal level. The affected muscle structure was assessed using ultrasound (Logiq GE E9, probe ML6–12) and functionality was evaluated based on data of the Global Positioning System (GPS), comparing the data obtained during the process of re-adaptation with data prior to the lesion. Percutaneous needle electrolysis was performed under ultrasound guidance at 48 hours after the injury following the protocol defined by Valera &amp; Minaya (2:3:5). The indoor recovery of players began 24 hours after the percutaneous needle electrolysis. Initially, the exercise program included activities of mobility and controlled loading. Thereafter, the players completed their readaptation program in the training field with exercises of progressive complexity and intensity (biomechanical patterns and neuromuscular control of the central zone and the lower limbs, sprint). Results Player A returned to competition in 16 days, player B returned in 14 days. No adverse effects were identified during or after the percutaneous needle electrolysis technique. The players only missed one competition game and the process of readaptation allowed them to return to play registering parameters which were similar to the values prior to the lesion, and maintaining the performance during the four matches following the intervention protocol. The players were followed up to eight months after the injury and neither player suffered a relapse during this period, which indicates the complete recovery of the injured muscle both on a structural and functional level. Conclusions The combined treatment using percutaneous needle electrolysis and a functional exercise program reduces the time for return to competition after a grade 2 muscle lesion in the hamstrings, with a level of performance that is similar to prior to the lesion, without relapses, in an 8 month follow up period. The criteria we use to determine when a player can return to train with the team and compete after an acute muscle injury are: the time that has passed since the lesion, structural changes and the ability to perform tasks."

The particles are maintained in levitation and a stationary rotation regime is observed. The model particles used are composed of a sphere and a helical tail. The rotating performance of the particles is investigated as a function of the length and the twisting of their tails. In addition, the flow field around a spherical particle trapped in the jet is characterized by a 3D-particle tracking velocimetry technique. This flow characterization is used to compute the near-field velocity around a captured particle and to predict the rotation reported for the different geometries tested."

The aim of this study was to examine women participating in fitness activities regarding their level of disability in daily activities and lumbar lordosis. Material and methods. Data were collected from 68 females between the ages of 25-70 participating in fitness exercises. The Oswestry Disability Index was applied to measure the level of disability due to the low back pain in everyday life. The angle of lumbar lordosis was measured using a Saunders’ digital inclinometer. Results. The results of the study confirmed the existence of problems related to low back pain in people performing sedentary work. There were no correlations between lumbar lordosis angle and the level of disability in daily activities of the groups. The low back pain increases especially among people performing sedentary work. Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that work in a sitting position is not associated with a decrease in the angle of lordosis in relation to another work than in a sitting position. Sitting work can be an indirect cause of back pain and slight disability in everyday life by weakening postural muscles.

Yet women appear to be more prone to sport-related concussion than men, and may manifest with more concussion-like symptoms both at both baseline and post-concussion. There may be both endocrinologic and biomechanical reasons why women’s concussive symptoms are different from men’s, but this remains incompletely understood. There may also be sex-based and gender-based differences in how men and women experience and describe concussion. It is important to understand these distinctions when managing concussion in women."
https://openalex.org/W3006590815,Biomechanical Study of Jumping &amp; Landing Techniques: Ballet vs Non-Ballet Athletes,2019-12-01,2019,dissertation,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of ACL injuries is increasing in previous years. One of the most common studied kinematic risk factors related to ACL injuries is a resultant weak, leg axis alignment known as the dynamic knee valgus angle presented during a vertical drop jump [8, 14, 15]. Hewett et. al. concluded that a knee valgus angle was a primary predictor of the mechanism that leads to an ACL rupture [8]. By increasing the excessive knee valgus angle during a two-legged DVJ, an athlete is in turn increasing the possibility of a high knee valgus moment, which can increase the anterior tibial translation as well as the load on the ACL several-fold and the chances for an ACL tear [4]."

Method: Nine healthy female professional soccer players (age: 24.0±2.5 yrs, height: 164.9±3.3 cm, weight: 55.7±6.6 kg, career: 11.2±1.4 yrs) were participated in this study. The subjects performed 10 times of double-leg and single-leg landing from the box of 30 cm height onto force plates respectively. The ground reaction force, angle, moment, angular velocity, and power of the ankle, knee, and hip joint on sagittal plane was calculated from initial contact to maximum knee flexion during landing phase. Statistical parametric mapping was used to compare the biomechanical variables of double-leg and single-leg landing of the dominant leg throughout the landing phase. Each mean difference of variables was analyzed using a paired t-test and alpha level was set to 0.05.
Results: For the biomechanical variables, significantly increased vertical ground reaction force, plantarflexion moment of the ankle joint, negative ankle joint power and extension moment of the hip joint were found in single-leg landing compared to double-leg landing (p<.05). In addition, the flexion angle and angular velocity of the knee and hip joint in double-leg landing were observed significantly greater than single-leg landing, respectively (p<.05).
Conclusion: These findings suggested that negative joint power and plantarflexion moment of the ankle joint can contribute to shock absorption during single-leg landing and may be the factors for preventing the musculoskeletal injuries of the lower extremity by an external force."

It is well known that RST effects may depend on several variables such as the duration of the protocol and repeated-sprint methodology. Few studies have evaluated very short-term protocols and compared different RST modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 2 week RST including straight sprints or changes of direction (CODs) on physical performance in a sample of soccer players. This study used a randomised pre-post parallel group trial design. The participants were assigned to either an RST group using straight sprints (RST-SS = 18 players) or an RST group using CODs (RST-COD = 18 players). The protocols were: 3 sets of 7 x 30 m sprints for the RST-SS and 7 x 20 + 20 m (one COD of 180°) for the RST-COD, with 20 s and 4 min recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. The following evaluations were performed: 10 and 20 m sprint, agility test, repeated sprint test (RSTbest and RSTmean), and Yo-Yo Recovery Level 1. After the training period, the RST-SS did not report any performance variation, while the RST-COD showed improvements in the 10 m sprint and RSTbest (effect size = 0.70 and 0.65, respectively). The between-group analysis did not report any statistical difference between the RST-SS and the RST-COD. In conclusion, this study did not support the utilisation of a very short-term RST protocol with soccer players, however, the RST-COD presented some additional benefits in sprint performance compared to the RST-SS."

They perform in dynamical contexts and are highly submitted to time pressure. The purpose of this naturalistic case study, therefore, was to explore how a handball expert goalkeeper deals with the uncertainty of the competition settings to make successful decisions. An individual self-confrontation interview was held with a goalkeeper while he watched duels with potential throwers in an official competition. A mixed method was used combining the first-person and third-person point of view. Verbal data were supplemented by observational data (distance measures between the goalkeeper and the potential thrower) in 83 short accounts of decision-making situations. Qualitative analysis resulted in 419 units of salient features, in three types of processes related to the Recognition-Primed Decision model, and in four micro-decisions. Non-parametrical statistical analysis indicated that there was a significant effect of distances between the potential thrower and the goalkeeper, on the micro-decision categories, but not on the recognition processes. These results provide insights into cognitive contents and processes an expert goalkeeper can use under uncertainty and time pressure. The mixed method furnishes a meaningful description and a subsequent understanding of expert performances in sport."

The objective of this study was to assess the anthropometric parameters and physical capacities of Congolese elite footballers by position. Twenty-two (22) footballers aged 27.00 ± 4.58 years to 31.00 ± 1.3 years participated in the study. Anthropometric parameters (weight, height, calf and thigh circumference, lean mass and percentage fat mass) and physical capacities (maximum oxygen consumption, reaction rate and vertical expansion) were measured per shift during the championship. The results showed a significant difference (p ˂ 0.05), anthropometric parameters and physical capacities according to the position held. A positive correlation was observed between the two variables. In conclusion, Congolese footballers have a morphology and physique that differ by position in response to the practice of elite football. Football managers and coaches should place the training material at the footballer's development centre and integrate its evaluation into the annual activity planning."

Current literature on responses to eccentric exercise in youth has demonstrated that potential concerns, such as fatigue and muscle damage, compared to adults are not supported. Considering the importance of resistance training for youth athletes and the benefits of eccentric training in enhancing strength, power, speed, and resistance to injury, its inclusion throughout youth may be warranted. In this review we provide a brief overview of the physiological responses to exercise in youth with specific reference to the different responses to eccentric resistance training between children, adolescents, and adults. Thereafter, we discuss the importance of ensuring that force absorption qualities are trained throughout youth and how these may be influenced by growth and maturation. In particular, we propose practical methods on how eccentric resistance training methods can be implemented in youth via the inclusion of efficient landing mechanics, eccentric hamstrings strengthening and flywheel inertia training. This article proposes that the use of eccentric resistance training in youth should be considered a necessity to help develop both physical qualities that underpin sporting performance, as well as reducing injury risk. However, as with any other training modality implemented within youth, careful consideration should be given in accordance with an individual's maturity status, training history and technical competency as well as being underpinned by current long-term physical development guidelines."

https://openalex.org/W2985686898,Differences in the Cortical Structure of the Whole Fibula and Tibia Between Long-Distance Runners and Untrained Controls. Toward a Wider Conception of the Biomechanical Regulation of Cortical Bone Structure,2019-11-27,2019,article,"The cortical structure of human fibula varies widely throughout the bone suggesting a more selective adaptation to different mechanical environments with respect to the adjacent tibia. To test this hypothesis, serial-pQCT scans of the dominant fibulae and tibiae of 15/15 men/women chronically trained in long-distance running were compared with those of 15/15 untrained controls. When compared to controls, the fibulae of trained individuals had similar (distally) or lower (proximally) cortical area, similar moments of inertia (MI) for anterior-posterior bending (xMI) and lower for lateral bending (yMI) with a lower 'shape-index' (yMI/xMI ratio) throughout, and higher resistance to buckling distally. These group differences were more evident in men and independent of group differences in bone mass. These results contrast with those observed in the tibia, where, as expected, structural indicators of bone strength were greater in trained than untrained individuals. Proximally, the larger lateral flexibility of runners' fibulae could improve the ability to store energy, and thereby contribute to fast-running optimization. Distally, the greater lateral fibular flexibility would facilitate heel-joint expansion during movement but reduce bending strength. The latter appears to have been compensated by a higher buckling strength. Assuming that these differences could be ascribed to training effects, this suggests that usage-derived strains in some bones may modify their relative structural resistance to different kinds of deformation in different regions, not only regarding strength, but also concerning other physiological roles of the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W3004736971,Kinetic and Kinematic Analysis of the Phases of Kicking during Accurate and Maximal Effort Conditions in Female Soccer Players,2019-11-26,2019,dissertation,"Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world and the substantial increase in participation over the last decade adds significance to understanding kicking mechanics as kicking is a key skill during a game. The biomechanics of soccer kicking have been widely investigated and there is a conventional belief that a tradeoff exists between speed and accuracy during kicking performance. However, the kinetics and kinematics of the kicking leg during the approach to the ball remain unclear and whether or not instep soccer kicks can be performed without a speed-accuracy tradeoff. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinetic and kinematic differences between accurate and maximal effort soccer kicking in female soccer players.
Twenty female soccer players from the college club or varsity level performed three trials of an accurate kick and three trials of a maximal effort kick. Bilateral hip, knee and ankle joint angles and velocities and ground reaction forces (GRFs) of the kicking leg (KL) and plant leg (PL) were calculated. In addition, correlation coefficients were calculated between variables in each condition. During maximal effort kicking, players significantly increased peak hip, knee and ankle angles (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 0.034), angular velocities (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 0.004), and foot velocity (p = 0.000) in the KL. This was likely the result of the significant increase in peak horizontal GRF in the KL (p = 0.000) and PL (p = 0.000). Peak horizontal GRF in the KL had the strongest correlation with foot linear velocity in accurate kicking (R = 0.77*) compared to in maximal effort kicking (R = 60*), and had a stronger influence on foot velocity compared to peak horizontal GRF in the PL in both accurate (R = 0.31*) and maximal effort (0.23) conditions. This suggests that peak horizontal GRF in the KL, rather than in the PL, plays a more important role in kick velocity, especially when kicking accurately. Results indicate that increasing horizontal GRF in the KL in both conditions is key to improving velocity since that variable is highly correlated in each condition. In addition, less variation of horizontal GRFs in the KL in maximal effort kicking indicate faster kicks result in more consistent foot velocities and suggests that players reduce variability as they approach maximum velocity. These results provide evidence that accuracy may not have to be sacrificed when kicks are faster if players practice accurate performances when kicking with maximum velocity due to the less variability in the initial programmed pattern of movement during fast performances. Coaches and trainers may utilize these results to develop training protocols that involve increasing GRFs of the KL and practicing kicks that are both accurate and fast to increase overall accuracy during maximum velocity instep soccer kicks."

The evaluations include context, introduction, process, and result. CIPP model developed by Sufflebeam is used as a method. The results found that context related to the history and purpose of establishment creation has been in accordance with the need of training young athletes. Entrants were selected from East Kalimantan districts and cities indicating that athlete distribution in 10 districts is not yet uniform. In addition, infrastructures need more intensive improvement and modernisation. Process evaluation shows that the implementation of the educational process and the coaching of achievements met the current criteria. Evaluating the outcome of the study based on the degree of graduation indicates that it is good. However, for certain sports events, a wider refinement of certain aspects seems necessary. Therefore, it can be concluded that the success of the school, coaching, training and management of the International Sports School cannot be separated from its human resources (athletes, coaches, teachers and management staff), as well as from other supporting systems (funding and infrastructure). If all components are taken into account, this will contribute to the most effective coaching process and will lead to significant achievements of athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2991636774,Convolutional neural network for efficient estimation of regional brain strains,2019-11-22,2019,article,"Abstract Head injury models are important tools to study concussion biomechanics but are impractical for real-world use because they are too slow. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate regional brain strains instantly and accurately by conceptualizing head rotational velocity profiles as two-dimensional images for input. We use two impact datasets with augmentation to investigate the CNN prediction performances with a variety of training-testing configurations. Three strain measures are considered, including maximum principal strain (MPS) of the whole brain, MPS of the corpus callosum, and fiber strain of the corpus callosum. The CNN is further tested using an independent impact dataset (N = 314) measured in American football. Based on 2592 training samples, it achieves a testing R 2 of 0.916 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.014 for MPS of the whole brain. Combining all impact-strain response data available (N = 3069), the CNN achieves an R 2 of 0.966 and RMSE of 0.013 in a 10-fold cross-validation. This technique may enable a clinical diagnostic capability to a sophisticated head injury model, such as facilitating head impact sensors in concussion detection via a mobile device. In addition, it may transform current acceleration-based injury studies into focusing on regional brain strains. The trained CNN is publicly available along with associated code and examples at https://github.com/Jilab-biomechanics/CNN-brain-strains . They will be updated as needed in the future."

Subjects (n DL = n CI = 16) stood in front of a wall with six LED‐light targets that flashed on in a random order and subjects had to move their hand in front of it as fast as possible in order to extinguish the target. After the pre‐test subjects followed a DL or CI training session, followed immediately by a post‐test, followed by one hour of rest and a retention test. Performance and motor control were measured respectively by visuomotor response time (VMRT) and an Index of Motor Abundance (IMA; reflecting the strength of movement synergies) calculated with Uncontrolled Manifold analysis. A mixed‐effects Bayesian ANOVA model was used to evaluate differences in changes in both parameters between both training groups. Averaged over the six targets, the decrease in VMRT was stronger for DL than CI at the post‐test (interference effect) but not at retention. The IMA was on average increased at post‐ and retention test in both groups, indicating stronger synergies between the degrees‐of‐freedom. While the ANOVA for IMA was not conclusive, the changes were likely not different between both learning methods. Thus, while an interference effect was found for CI but not DL in terms of performance on the task, no such effect was observed on the behavioural level in terms of the strength of movement synergies."

The objective of this review is to integrate scientific and best practice literature regarding the training and development of elite sprint performance. Sprint performance is heavily dependent upon genetic traits, and the annual within-athlete performance differences are lower than the typical variation, the smallest worthwhile change, and the influence of external conditions such as wind, monitoring methodologies, etc. Still, key underlying determinants (e.g., power, technique, and sprint-specific endurance) are trainable. In this review, we describe how well-known training principles (progression, specificity, variation/periodization, and individualization) and varying training methods (e.g., sprinting/running, technical training, strength/power, plyometric training) are used in a sprint training context. Indeed, there is a considerable gap between science and best practice in how training principles and methods are applied. While the vast majority of sprint-related studies are performed on young team sport athletes and focus on brief sprints with maximal intensity and short recoveries, elite sprinters perform sprinting/running over a broad range of distances and with varying intensity and recovery periods. Within best practice, there is a stronger link between choice of training component (i.e., modality, duration, intensity, recovery, session rate) and the intended purpose of the training session compared with the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach in scientific literature. This review provides a point of departure for scientists and practitioners regarding the training and development of elite sprint performance and can serve as a position statement for outlining state-of-the-art sprint training recommendations and for generation of new hypotheses to be tested in future research."

Support for the next of kin is one of the cornerstones of palliative care, but the principles are not always adhered to as recommended when caring for the elderly, which can affect the quality of life of their next of kin. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of quality of life among the next of kin of older persons who live in nursing homes before an educational intervention of palliative care. Methods This is an explorative qualitative interview study with 40 next of kin using qualitative content analysis performed at baseline before the implementation of the principles of palliative care in nursing homes. Results The next of kin’s experiences of quality of life were expressed in three themes: Orientation to the new life situation, Challenges in their relationship and the Significance of the quality of care in the nursing home. The next of kin experienced a sense of relief, although the older person was constantly on their minds, and they could feel lonely. The difference in the couple’slife situations was experienced as burdensome by the next of kin. The challenges in the relationship were described as stressful, related to a guilty conscience and the older person’s vulnerability. The nursing home could be a context facilitating good relations. The perceptions of quality of care in terms of person-centredness affected the quality of life of the next of kin. Conclusions The findings show that four factors are decisive for the quality of life of next of kin: the relationships within the family, the degree of relief that nursing home care entails as compared to home care, the older person’s health status and whether the care is person-centred. Increased knowledge and education regarding palliative care in nursing homes are needed to better meet the needs of next of kin. Implementation of palliative care should take into account the need for support for next of kin. Trial registration NCT02708498 , 15 March 2016."

This has been explained as being due to their right-brain dominance which appears to have made it easier for left-handers to be more elastic in cognitive activities, allowing them to easily cope with challenges, perceive the bigger idea and be self-sustaining. Cross-sectional studies also show meaningfully enhanced left-hander incidences among top athletes exclusively in interactive sports and boxing occasioned by the surprise effect. Despite this, left-handers experience difficulties using everyday tools. Pre-school left-handers experience hitches primarily in writing left-to-right, expressing and responding to spatial discernments, which has contributed to them being the majority in remedial classes. Mismatches in the teaching/learning environment causes older children to fail to complete timed tasks which negatively affects their academic achievements. In sports, left-handers benefit more from long and intense training because of using training manuals meant for right-handers. The adjustments left-handers have to make in school and at the workplace in order to function comfortably usually causes hand, back, neck and shoulder pains which not only decreases their effectiveness but also compromises their physical and emotional wellbeing. An amalgamation of all these has made left-handedness appear as an obstruction to daily life generally and specifically in school. This review paper that sought to establish that the society’s failure to accommodate left-handedness needs addressing, recommended creating societal left-handedness awareness programs, paradigm shifting in initial and continuing teacher training programs and classroom pedagogical approaches, establishment of inclusive teaching/learning resources, and the provision of evenhanded daily use tools by manufacturers at no extra cost."

It is not only the physical make up of women that has been measured and categorised by sport scientists and therefore 'known' by everyone else; indeed, the psychological characteristics of females have also been identified as different to those of their male counterparts. Clearly the cumulative effect of the large body of sports research has significant implications for coaching women – namely that it reinforces and solidifies even, the general belief that female bodies cannot be exposed to and are simply not capable of completing the same training practices as male bodies. Established and contemporary research that has focused on the social context of women's sport has explored how the 'different nature of women' continues to be reinforced in sports settings."

Significant reduction in physical activity is a powerful indicator of cardiovascular (CV) disease; therefore, those with a history of ACL injury may be at increased risk for CV disease compared with noninjured individuals. Focused Clinical Question : Do individuals with a history of ACL injury demonstrate negative CV changes compared with those without a history of ACL injury? Summary of Key Findings : Three articles met the inclusion criteria and investigated CV changes after ACL injury. Both cross-sectional studies compared participants with ACL injury with matched controls. Bell et al compared time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity and step count, whereas Almeida et al compared maximum rate of oxygen consumption, ventilatory thresholds, isokinetic quadriceps strength, and body composition. Collectively, both quantitative studies found that individuals with a history of ACL injury had less efficient CV systems compared with matched controls and/or preoperative data. Finally, a qualitative study of 3506 retired National Football League athletes showed an increased rate of arthritis and knee replacement surgery after an ACL injury when compared with other retired National Football League members, in addition to a &gt;50% increased rate of myocardial infarction. Clinical Bottom Line : A history of ACL injury is a source of impaired physical activity. Preliminary data indicate that these physical activity limitations negatively impair the CV system, and individuals with a history of ACL injury demonstrate lower maximum oxygen consumption, self-reported disability, and daily step count compared with noninjured peers. These complications support the need for greater emphasis on CV wellness. Strength of Recommendation : Consistent findings from 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 survey study suggest level IIB evidence to support that ACL injury is associated with negative CV health."

The general public’s awareness of concussive injuries in sports may be at an all-time high. Recent coverage in the lay media [8, 13] has emphasized the risks and long-term sequelae of sports-related concussion in athletes. It is well-known that contact sports, like American football, with its frequent collisions between players, are associated with the highest incidence of concussive injuries [4, 5, 9]. One study found that in a convenience sample of 202 deceased players of American football from a brain donation program, the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players across all levels of play (87%), including 110 of 111 former National Football League players (99%) [10]. Although women athletes are less likely to incur a head injury caused by contact with another player than are men athletes, women athletes are more likely to incur a concussive injury from a playing surface or an apparatus than men [1]. In the current meta-analysis, Ling and colleagues [7] found that women athletes have a lower risk of player-contact-induced concussions in lacrosse, basketball, ice hockey, and soccer than do men, but are more likely to experience concussions because of ball or equipment contact in lacrosse and soccer compared to men playing those same sports. These results held true in spite of rules differences between the men’s and women’s lacrosse games. Injury is a part of sport, and participating athletes and the supporting public are willing to accept nominal risk. But the prospect of late dementia, accelerated by repetitive microtrauma to the brain, looms over all participants in contact sports, as well as the sports themselves. Where Do We Need To Go? The current study helps readers better understand the different ways in which men and women athletes get concussions across different sports. The key question is how do we translate the information provided by Ling and colleagues [7] into actual safety practices for athletes? Rules changes, equipment modification, or additional training could potentially curb some repetitive hits to the head. In 2015, the United States Soccer Federation announced the U.S. Soccer Concussion Initiative 2016, which bans heading for children 10 years of age or younger. This initiative limits headers for children aged 11 to 13 to 30 minutes per week [3]. Yet, the case can be made that rules changes and equipment modifications may not be enough to solve the problem in some sports [6]. Additionally, development costs will likely be high and concerns about product liability always arise. Future studies that examine the effects of equipment and player surfaces on injuries can help us to determine if these changes can actually reduce the rate and severity of injury and whether they are likely to be cost effective. Advances in materials science, helmet design and use of protective devices and padding are likely to incrementally improve the safety of athletes involved in rough play. But in sports in which the risk of concussion is high, it may not be ethical or desirable to experiment on the brains of another generation of young players knowing what we know now [6]. Educational programs exist for young athletes and common sense training for coaches and athletes could be effective as ACL injury prevention has gained some traction [2, 12, 15]. How Do We Get There? While randomized, multi-center studies with a high number of patients often are a mainstay of study, these can be hard to do, costly, and time consuming. It is likely that information gleaned from databases such as those maintained by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Athletic Trainers’ Association [11] will be helpful. Ongoing study of the epidemiology of concussive injury will be needed. Biomechanical studies of protective equipment and play surfaces will be helpful. Research into the effects of concussion-prevention training could be promising [14]. The time is right for studies to examine injury rates for women and girl athletes in soccer and lacrosse with and without concussion-prevention training."

In this way, this research aimed to identify, applying the OWAS method, the musculoskeletal disorders that affect these workers. The results obtained have made it possible to identify the risks and consequently actions to reduce or eliminate them. The most critical posture identified was the kneeling pose when he is brushing the sides of the swimming pool. To eliminate this posture, it is proposed to change a manual brush to a brush with telescopic stick, designed with an angle that allows the worker to stand upright without flexed his trunk while cleaning the pool. This change improves the working conditions, providing well-being and reducing as negative consequences."

This study tracked countermovement jump, knee isometric strength, and kinetics and kinematics in 8 female soccer players (experimental group) during an anticipated sidestep maneuver before and after two matches played over a 43-h period. Time points were: Before and after match 1 (T0 and T1), 12 h after the first match (T2), and immediately after the second match (T3). A control group participated only in practice sessions. Isometric knee extension strength decreased by 14.8% at T2 (p = 0.003), but knee flexion was not affected until T3, declining by 12.6% (p = 0.018). During the sidestep maneuver, knee joint degrees of flexion at initial contact was increased by 17.1% at T3, but maximum knee and hip angle at initial contact were unchanged. Peak resultant ground reaction force (GRF) increased by 12.6% (p = 0.047) at T3 (3.03 xBW) from 2.69 xBW at T0, while posterior GRF was significantly higher than T0 at all three subsequent time points (T1 = 0.82 ± 0.23 xBW, T2 = 0.87 ± 0.22 xBW, T3 = 0.89 ± 0.22 xBW). Anterior tibial shear force increased significantly (p = 0.020) at T3 (1.24 ± 0.12 xBW) compared to T1 (1.15 ± 0.13 xBW), an 8.8% increase. Lateral tibial shear force was significantly higher at both T1 (0.95 ± 0.20 xBW) and T3 (1.15 ± 0.38 xBW) compared to T0 (0.67 ± 0.25 xBW). These findings suggest that participation in a soccer match has significant effects on both physical performance parameters and kinetics/kinematics during a sidestep cut, but these can be more pronounced after a second match with short rest."

Twenty female court-sport athletes were randomly allocated to two groups, a control (n = 10) and an intervention group (n = 10). All participants performed pre-testing inclusive of a 20-m sprint, countermovement jump (CMJ), Illinois agility test, and the qualitative analysis of a single-leg squat (QASLS), which is an assessment of dynamic neuromuscular control. Subsequently the intervention group engaged in a modified version of the FIFA 11+ neuromuscular training program twice weekly for 8 weeks. At post-testing, there were between-group differences in CMJ (intervention; +3.96-cm vs control; −1.36-cm, P = .003) and QASLS for both legs (P < .001) (right leg, intervention; pre: 3.75, post: 1.91, and control; pre: 4.11, post: 4.08) (left leg, intervention; pre: 3.72, post: 0.98, and control; pre: 4.05, post: 4.23). There was a within-group improvement in 20-m sprint for the intervention group only post-training (pre: 3.69-seconds; post: 3.60-seconds, P = .043), while no differences occurred in Illinois agility test for either group. A modified FIFA 11+ protocol can be considered an effective neuromuscular training program for enhancing dynamic neuromuscular control and sport-specific physical performance in female court-sport athletes."

The purpose of this study was to identify the different pathways to Major League Baseball (MLB) and explore their influence on career success. Performance and developmental data of 2,291 American-born MLB players who debuted between 1990 and 2010 were collected using baseball-reference.com. Three performance indicators, career games played (GP), age of debut, and wins above replacement (WAR; player's total contributions in wins), were coupled with high school, post-secondary, and Minor League Baseball (MiLB) data. Analyses revealed 17 descriptively different pathways to MLB, which were grouped into three main streams based on the last institution attended before entrance into professional baseball. Overall, 63% of the athletes started their career directly after attending a 4 year higher education institution, 23% after high school, and 14% directly after attending a 2 year institution. Interestingly, 78% of the athletes did not sign or were not selected as high school draft picks. Position players drafted or signed from high school debuted in MLB younger (M = 23.99) and averaged significantly more MiLB GP (M = 909.13) than those drafted or signed from a 2 year (M = 25.67 and 834.41 GP) or 4 year institution (M = 25.95 and 752.33 GP). Pitchers signed or drafted from high school also debuted in MLB younger and played more MiLB games, as well as played in more MLB games than players from a 2 year or 4 year institution, F(8, 3,082) = 31.96, p ≤ 0.001. No significant differences of WAR were noted in position players or pitchers. Perhaps pitchers who are drafted from high school are afforded more opportunities to succeed, which may be indicative of sunk cost effects. This is conceivable as these players had the highest average GP but did not accrue a higher WAR. Future research may benefit from the consideration of post-secondary and/or high school statistics in combination with draft selection data, which may have important implications for improving talent identification accuracy."

An insole (TI) with increased static (35%) and dynamic (49%) coefficient of friction compared to a regular insole (SI) was tested. Change of direction performance was faster (p < .001) and perceived to be faster (p < .001) in TI compared to SI. Participants utilised greater coefficient of friction in TI compared to SI during a complete turn, but not during a 20 degree side-cut. In-shoe foot sliding reduced across the forefoot and midfoot during the braking phase of the turn and in the rearfoot during the side-cut in TI. Greater in-shoe foot sliding occurred in the turn than the side-cut across all foot regions. Results provide guidance for athletic footwear design to help limit in-shoe foot sliding and improve change of direction performance."

Here, we introduce Open-Sim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation but requires extensive technical expertise to implement. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves, allowing them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle the wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which are common in musculoskeletal models. To show Moco’s abilities, we first solve for muscle activity that produces an observed walking motion while minimizing muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Then, we predict a squat-to-stand motion and optimize the stiffness of a passive assistive knee device. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand human and animal movement."

A total of one hundred sixty-seven young promises futsal players participated in this study (84 U16 and 83 U19) and have been chosen to play Championship of Spain Selections. The Psychological Characteristics related to SP for soccer players Questionnaire was used, and one-way ANOVA test was performed based on the playing position (goalkeeper, defender and defender-wing, wing and wing-defender, pivot and wing-pivot, and universal). Results showed that goalkeepers had the best psychological profile and characteristics related to SP. Pivots and wing-pivots had less self-confidence, and universals players, less stress control in relation to the rest of the playing positions (p < 0.05). The main findings revealed that the psychological characteristics and profile related to SP in young promises futsal players are different according to the playing position, and this study suggest the inclusion of psychological-training programs in order to improve the psychological abilities of players, especially for players with offensive role who seek to score goals."

Ankle stability is due to a number of mechanisms, such as muscle control between agonists and antagonists, proprioception, balance, and muscle strength. If there are changes in any of these mechanisms, there is an increased risk of ankle injuries. Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze the ankle function of amateur and professional soccer players in the preseason, using Y Balance Test (YBT) and Dorsiflexion Lunge Test (DLT), observing possible functional deficits in this sample, and subsequently analyzing the relationship of results between the functional tests in this population. Methods A total of 107 soccer players were assessed, of whom 36 were amateur and 71 professional athletes. The volunteers initially underwent history taking, followed by a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle then the YBT and DLT functional tests. Results There was no significant difference in the DLT between dominant and non-dominant limbs in amateur and professional athletes. There was also no significant difference in the YBT between dominant and non-dominant limbs of amateur athletes, but there was a significant difference between dominant and non-dominant limbs in professional athletes. There was no correlation between the tests when the dominant and non-dominant limbs of the sample were analyzed. Conclusion The weak relationship between the functional tests indicates that both tests are recommended for athletes in clinical practice, since they serve as tools to assess different functional deficits.

Scientific and technological innovations are devised to increase performance, ensure greater accuracy of measurement and officiating, reduce risks of harm, enhance spectatorship and raise revenues. However, such innovations inevitably come up against epistemological and metaphysical problems related to the nature of sport and physical competition. This special issue identifies and explores key and contemporary philosophical issues in relation to the science of sport and exercise. The opening four chapters focus on the nature of scientific evidence, and causation in sport; the middle four chapters on the influence of science and technology and its relationship to sport officiating; whilst the final three chapters consider the way in which science affects the construction of sport. It brings together scholars working on philosophical problems in sport to examine issues related to the values and assumptions behind sport and exercise science, key problems that result, and provide recommendations for improving its practice."

Reliability studies on landing mechanics of such maneuvers are however lacking. This study investigated feasibility and within-session reliability of landing mechanics of a novel one-leg double-hop test, mimicking a land-and-cut maneuver, in individuals with ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Our test comprised a forward hop followed by a diagonal hop in either of two directions (medial/lateral) under anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Twenty individuals with a unilateral ACLR (aged 24.2 ± 4.2 years, 0.7-10.8 years post-surgery) performed three successful hops/direction per leg. We determined reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and agreement (standard error of measurement [SEM]) of 3-dimensional hip and knee angles and moments during the deceleration phase of the land-and-cut maneuver (vulnerable for non-contact ACL injuries). Mean success rate for unanticipated hops was 71-77% and for anticipated hops 91-95%. Both limbs demonstrated moderate-excellent reliability (ICC 95% confidence intervals: 0.50-0.99) for almost all hip and knee peak angles and moments in all planes and conditions, with a few exceptions: poor-good reliability for hip and knee frontal and/or transverse plane variables, especially for lateral diagonal hops. The SEMs were ≤5° and ≤0.23 N·m/kg·m for most peak angles and moments, respectively. Our test seems feasible and showed satisfactory reliability for most hip and knee angles and moments; however, low knee abduction and internal rotation angles and moments, and moderate reliability of these moments deserve consideration. The test appears to challenge dynamic knee control and may prove valuable in evaluation during knee rehabilitation."

There are many injury risk factors related to intrinsic (non-modifiable) and/or extrinsic (modifiable) factors of ACL injury.Research of the studies was conducted until September 2018 without publication data limitation or language restriction on the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, ISI, EXCERPTA.To date, evidence from the literature suggests that the risk of ACL injury is multifactorial and involves biomechanical, anatomical, hormonal, and neuromuscular factors. Despite this relative complexity, the mechanisms of injury are well known and rationally classified into two categories: mechanisms of injury based on contact or on non-contact with another player, with the non-contact injury mechanisms clearly prevailing over the mechanisms of contact injury. One of the most frequent biomechanical risk factors, associated with ACL non-contact injury, is represented by the valgus knee in the pivoting and cutting movements and in the landing phase after jumping. Gender-related risk factors show female populations to have a higher predisposition to ACL injury than males However, there are still some theoretical and practical aspects that need further investigation such as; genetic risks together with the role of estrogen and progesterone receptors in female populations, and the in-vivo interaction shoe-playing surface. In particular, the genetic risk factors of ACL lesion seem to be an interesting and promising field of investigation, where considerable progress has still to be made.This narrative review provides an insight into the risk factors of ACL injury that could be used by practitioners for preventing injury in football (soccer)."

The experimental group was treated with 2 pre-set programs 4 times a week with an adaptive neuro-stimulation (ANS) able to interact with cutaneous receptors through an ENF Physio® device with a range of electrical frequency of about 15-350 Hz; the placebo-controlled group received the treatment with the device switched off. Patients performed a myometric evaluation with the MyotonPRO® system and a postural one with the Rarog software at T0 before the treatment and at T1 after the four-week treatment.After our intervention, we identified an improvement in muscular tone, in particular in the hamstring muscles (17.69%, right P<0.01 / left P<0.05) and a rebalancing of the principal bone points in the postural system (shoulder 71%, P<0.05, hips 65.6%, P=0.056, sagittal AP and frontal LL center of gravity, respectively 40%, P<0.05 and 52.7%, P=0.01).In conclusion, we could hypothesize the usefulness of an ANS to act on these parameters. ANS could be used not only for treatment of injuries but also in the field of prevention."

In this idea, coordination is addressed in the football game of children aged 10-12 through specific tests. Experimental pedagogy took place within a sports club from Braşov city to the age group of 10-12 years, practicing the football game. Through the three tests specifically used in the research, a correlation between football co-ordination (component of proprioception) and the specific football-specific coordination skill (skill) was attempted. The pedagogical experiment included two initial and final tests, through which the subjects were evaluated at three specific control samples adapted to their age. The tasks pursued in the pedagogical experiment, through the three specific tests, focused on the registration of specific indicators of the fieldless ball movement on the one hand, and on the other hand specific aspects of the ball biomechanics, the basic condition of the manifestation of the specific technique of the subjects in the football game. At the end of the scientific research, we validated the experimental hypothesis through the conclusions formulated. This has demonstrated the existence of a direct correlation between the level of subject coordination and the specific skill gaming indices resulting from the applied tests."

However, time-consuming intervention models could be easily rejected by coaches. Therefore, alternative and efficient field training options are warranted. One such method could be heavy resisted sprint training. However, it is unknown whether such overload will be efficient in assisting increases in sprint performance in a professional setting, and whether violating kinematic specificity via heavy loading will lead to changes in unloaded sprinting kinematics. Thus, we investigated whether heavy resisted training affects sprint performance and sagittal plane kinematics. Training-induced changes in sprint FV-profiles were computed before and after the 9-week, 2 sessions x week protocol. Out of the two recruited teams (N = 32, age: 24.1 ± 5.0 years: height: 180 ± 10 cm; body-mass: 76.7 ± 7.7 kg), one was used as a control group continuing training as normal (CON, N = 13), while the experimental team was divided into two subgroups based on their initial sprint performance: 1) Heavy sled training with the 60% velocity drop (N = 10) and 2) 50% velocity drop load (N = 9). Both experimental groups improved significantly all 0-30-m split times (p &amp;lt; 0.05, d = -0.62 – -1.25), with post-hoc showing HS50% improving significantly compared to CON in 0-10-m split (d = 1.03) and Pmax (d = 1.16). No differences in sprinting kinematics were observed. With appropriate coaching, heavy sled training could be a pragmatic option to assist improvements in sprint performance without adverse changes in sprinting kinematics in professional soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W2982387630,Development of a Concussion Risk Function for a Youth Population Using Head Linear and Rotational Acceleration,2019-10-28,2019,article,"Physical differences between youth and adults, which include incomplete myelination, limited neck muscle development, and a higher head-body ratio in the youth population, likely contribute towards the increased susceptibility of youth to concussion. Previous research efforts have considered the biomechanics of concussion for adult populations, but these known age-related differences highlight the necessity of quantifying the risk of concussion for a youth population. This study adapted the previously developed Generalized Acceleration Model for Brian Injury Threshold (GAMBIT) that combines linear and rotational head acceleration to model the risk of concussion for a youth population with the Generalized Acceleration Model for Concussion in Youth (GAM-CY). Survival analysis was used in conjunction with head impact data collected during participation in youth football to model risk between individuals who sustained medically-diagnosed concussions (n = 15). Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated for peak linear acceleration, peak rotational acceleration, and GAM-CY, all of which were observed to be better injury predictors than random guessing. GAM-CY was associated with an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.95) when all head impacts experienced by the concussed players were considered. Concussion tolerance was observed to be lower for youth athletes, with average peak linear head acceleration of 62.4 ± 29.7 g compared to 102.5 ± 32.7 g for adults and average peak rotational head acceleration of 2609 ± 1591 rad/s2 compared to 4412 ± 2326 rad/s2. These data provide further evidence of age-related differences in concussion tolerance and may be used for the development of youth-specific protective designs."
https://openalex.org/W2988211041,Avoid or engage? Outcomes of graded exposure in youth with chronic pain using a sequential replicated single-case randomized design,2019-10-28,2019,article,"Abstract Pain-related fear is typically associated with avoidance behavior and pain-related disability in youth with chronic pain. Youth with elevated pain-related fear have attenuated treatment responses; thus, targeted treatment is highly warranted. Evidence supporting graded in vivo exposure treatment (GET) for adults with chronic pain is considerable, but just emerging for youth. The current investigation represents the first sequential replicated and randomized single-case experimental phase design with multiple measures evaluating GET for youth with chronic pain, entitled GET Living . A cohort of 27 youth (81% female) with mixed chronic pain completed GET Living. For each participant, a no-treatment randomized baseline period was compared with GET Living and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Daily changes in primary outcomes fear and avoidance and secondary outcomes pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and pain acceptance were assessed using electronic diaries and subjected to descriptive and model-based inference analyses. Based on individual effect size calculations, a third of participants significantly improved by the end of treatment on fear, avoidance, and pain acceptance. By follow-up, over 80% of participants had improved across all primary and secondary outcomes. Model-based inference analysis results to examine the series of replicated cases were generally consistent. Improvements during GET Living was superior to the no-treatment randomized baseline period for avoidance, pain acceptance, and pain intensity, whereas fear and pain catastrophizing did not improve. All 5 outcomes emerged as significantly improved at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The results of this replicated single-case experimental phase design support the effectiveness of graded exposure for youth with chronic pain and elevated pain-related fear avoidance."

A total of 20 elite male collegiate soccer players (mean age, 19.6±0.7 years; height, 173.4±4.4 cm; body weight, 66.9±7.3 kg; and body mass index, 22.0±2.0 kg/m2) participated in the present study. The subjects were divided into two groups: the high FMS (FMS total score ≥14 points, n=10) and low FMS (FMS total score <14 points, n=10). All participants completed 10-m and 30-m sprint tests, the arrowhead agility test (right and left), and a coordination test. The statistical methods used to verify the study results were the independent sample t-test and Kendall's Tau b correlation test. There were significant differences between the high and low FMS groups in the 10-m (P=0.014) and 30-m sprint (P=0.002) and arrowhead agility tests (right, P=0.039). Conversely, there were no significant differences in the arrowhead agility (left) and coordination tests between the two groups (P>0.05). Moreover, the FMS total score was found to have significant negative correlations with the 10-m sprint (r=-0.444, P=0.017), 30-m sprint (r=-0.425, P=0.016), and arrowhead agility tests (right, r=-0.389, P=0.023).

https://openalex.org/W2982159903,Kinematic analysis of soccer goalkeepers’ diving motion towards shots placed far away,2019-10-27,2019,article,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the biomechanical characteristics of soccer goalkeepers (GKs) diving for shots placed distantly from the GK. Fifteen collegiate male GKs and 13 collegiate male outfield players acting as strikers participated. The experimental situation involved shooting from inside the penalty area. The strikers were instructed to execute an instep kick placing the ball 16.5 m away from the GK after pushing the ball forward. The GKs were instructed to dive with a preparatory motion toward the shot ball. Three-dimensional coordinate data for the strikers and GKs were captured using 2 motion capture systems – one with 16 cameras for the GKs and the other with 8 cameras for the strikers (250Hz). The systems were synchronized with an analog signal via an A/D converter (1000 Hz) and input to a computer. The shooting areas were divided into 12 (i.e. 2 shooting directions to the right and left sides of the GKs, 2 shooting distances close to and far from the GKs, and 3 shot heights, close to the ground, and also at high and medium heights). The strikers were informed of the target shooting area randomly in each trial, and 213 trials in which the GKs dived toward shots placed in the far area were selected. We calculated the velocity of the center of gravity and the joint angles of the lower limbs. The major findings were as follows. 1) Regardless of shooting height, it appeared that the GKs performed almost the same motion until landing because they began to move after determining the diving direction. 2) In order to dive to lower-placed balls, leaning the trunk towards the diving direction was necessary to allow placement of the hand in the lower position. 3) Regardless of shooting height, the side contralateral (CS) to the leg in the diving direction had the same role of achieving movement of the center of gravity in the diving direction. 4) The GKs dived toward lower-placed shots by flexing the knee joint of their CS leg and the hip and knee joints of their ball side (BS) leg before the BS leg touched the ground. 5) The GKs dived towards individual shot heights by appropriately adjusting the posture of their BS leg before the BS leg touched the ground."

Recent evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin system impacts on skeletal muscle wasting. The aim of this study was to determine association between the AGT Met235Thr, ACE I/D and BDKRB2 -9/+9 polymorphisms with inflammation, myocardial and muscle injury induced by endurance exercise. Eighty-one Brazilian male runners participated in this study and completed the International Marathon of Sao Paulo. Muscle and myocardial damage markers (alanine transaminase, ALT, aspartate transaminase, AST, lactic dehydrogenase, LDH, creatine kinase, CK, Troponin, pro BNP, myoglobin, and CK-MB) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL12p70, IL1β, and TNF-α) were determined one day before, immediately after, one day after, and three days after the event. Muscle damage was also determined fifteen days after race and angiotensinogen (AGT) Met235Thr, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D, and Bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2) -9/+9 polymorphisms were determined. Marathon race participation induced an increase in all muscle damage and inflammatory markers evaluated (p < 0.0001). The muscle damage markers, troponin and pro BNP, CK and LDH and inflammatory markers, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and IL-10 were also higher in ACE II genotype immediately after race, compared to DD genotype. The percentage of runners higher responders (>500U/I) to CK levels was higher for II genotypes (69%) compared to DD and ID genotypes (38% and 40%, respectively) immediately after. Troponin, pro BNP and IL-1β, IL-8 levels were also elevated in AGT MM genotype compared to TT genotype athletes after and/or one day after race. BDKRB2 -9/-9 had pronounced response to LDH, CK, CK-MB and ALT and AST activities, myoglobin, troponin, IL-6, IL-8 levels immediately, one day and/or three days after race. The percentage of runners higher responders (>500U/I) to CK levels was greater for -9-9 and -9+9 genotypes (46 and 48%, respectively) compared to +9+9 genotypes (31%) immediately after. ACE II, AGT MM, and BDKRB2 -9-9 genotypes may increase the susceptibility to inflammation, muscle injury after endurance exercise and could be used to predict the development of clinical conditions associated with muscle damage and myocardial injury."

Assessment requires reliable functional tests that discriminate such outcomes from asymptomatic knees, while providing suitable loading for different populations. The One-leg rise (OLR) test is common in clinics and research but lacks scientific evidence for its implementation. Our cross-sectional study compared performance including knee kinematics of the OLR between ACL-injured persons in the very long term to controls and between legs within these groups, and assessed the within-session reliability of the kinematics.Seventy ACL-injured individuals (mean age 46.9 ± 5.4 years) treated with either reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy (ACLR; n = 33) or physiotherapy alone (ACLPT; n = 37), on average 23 years post-injury, and 33 age- and sex-matched controls (CTRL) attempted the OLR. Participants completed as many repetitions as possible to a maximum of 50 while recorded by motion capture. We compared between all groups and between legs within groups for total repetitions and decomposed the OLR into movement phases to compare phase completion times, maximum and range of knee abduction and adduction angles, and mediolateral knee control in up to 10 repetitions per participant.ACLPT performed significantly fewer OLR repetitions with their injured leg compared to the CTRL non-dominant leg (medians 15 and 32, respectively) and showed significantly greater knee abduction than ACLR and CTRL (average 2.56°-3.69° depending on phase and leg). Distribution of repetitions differed between groups, revealing 59% of ACLPT unable to complete more than 20 repetitions on their injured leg compared to 33% ACLR and 36% CTRL for their injured and non-dominant leg, respectively. Within-session reliability of all kinematic variables for all groups and legs was high (ICC 3,10 0.97-1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.00, SEM 0.93-1.95°).Negative outcomes of OLR performance, particularly among ACLPT, confirm the need to address aberrant knee function and stability even decades post-ACL injury. Knee kinematics derived from the OLR were reliable for asymptomatic and ACL-injured knees. Development of the OLR protocol and analysis methods may improve its discriminative ability in identifying reduced knee function and stability among a range of clinical populations."
https://openalex.org/W2982275074,The time course and mechanisms of change in biomarkers of joint metabolism in response to acute exercise and chronic training in physiologic and pathological conditions,2019-10-24,2019,review,"The benefits of exercise across the lifespan and for a wide spectrum of health and diseases are well known. However, there remains less clarity as to the effects of both acute and chronic exercise on joint health. Serum biomarkers of joint metabolism are sensitive to change and have the potential to differentiate between normal and adverse adaptations to acute and chronic load. Therefore, the primary objective of this review is to evaluate how serum biomarkers can inform our understanding of how exercise affects joint metabolism.A comprehensive literature search was completed to identify joint biomarkers previously used to investigate acute and chronic exercise training.Identified biomarkers included those related to joint cartilage, bone, synovium, synovial fluid, and inflammation. However, current research has largely focused on the response of serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) to acute loading in healthy young individuals. Studies demonstrate how acute loading transiently increases serum COMP (i.e., cartilage metabolism), which is mostly dependent on the duration of exercise. This response does not appear to be associated with any lasting deleterious changes, cartilage degradation, or osteoarthritis.Several promising biomarkers for assessing joint metabolism exist and may in future enhance our understanding of the physiological response to acute and chronic exercise. Defining 'normal' and 'abnormal' biomarker responses to exercise and methodological standardisation would greatly improve the potential of research in this area to understand mechanisms and inform practice."

Twenty youth Portuguese under-15 football players participated in this study. All players were exposed to two training approaches: i) traditional, in which the players performed a total of 36 kicks in a blocked and repetitive approach; and ii) differential learning, which consisted in the 36 kicks using differential variations in each kick. Football kicking impact and velocity were assessed using a Stalker radar gun, while the kicking accuracy was assessed by aggregating the total number of points achieved during 12 kicks into a goal, which was divided into quantifiable scoring zones. Lastly, leg power was measured using a countermovement jump. Measurements were performed at baseline, post-intervention, and following a 35-minute training match. The comparisons between the baseline and post-test revealed that the differential learning approach promoted a possibly ~5% increase in the countermovement jump (small effects) and a likely ~3% increase in the average velocity (small effects) when compared with the traditional training approach. From the accuracy perspective, there was a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-test and post-match in accurate kicks into zone 1 (centre of the goal) and a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-match in accurate kicks into zone 5 (lateral zones at short height) in the differential intervention. In turn, a small increase in the accurate kicks into zones 4 and 6 (lateral zones of the goal and nearest to the bar, respectively) was found from the baseline to the post-match in the differential intervention. Overall, the differential learning intervention was more beneficial than a traditional training protocol with respect to acute improvements in countermovement jump performance, football kicking velocity and higher scoring zones kicking accuracy."

College and university physical activity courses (PACs) are encouraged to incorporate technology for effective pedagogical practices. No qualitative research has specifically examined the culture of PACs instructors’ attitudes and experiences with technology as a pedagogical tool. A mini-ethnographic case study explored the use of technology among seven graduate teaching assistants who shared their pedagogical experiences, teaching practices, and perceptions of technology within PACs. Using an interpretive phenomenological analysis, composite narrative accounts were presented to highlight unique characteristics of PAC instructors and develop meaning from their lived experiences. The findings revealed that PAC instructors use varying forms of technology, but all instructors rely on learning management systems as a pedagogical tool, which can be influenced by campus environment, pedagogical experiences, and social support. This pilot study contributes to the current gap in research related to technology in PACs and addresses the need to properly prepare instructors to teach in the digital age."
https://openalex.org/W2980874172,Validity and reliability of an Australian football small-sided game to assess kicking proficiency,2019-10-19,2019,article,"In Australian Football (AF), small sided games have been used extensively as an alternative training method for technical and physical adaptations. Considering their application to AF, it is surprising a valid and reliable small-sided game kicking assessment remains absent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable 5v6 Australian football small-sided game kicking proficiency assessment. Youth male AF players (n = 145) from different stages within the AF talent pathway were recruited. Validity (i.e., logical and construct) and reliability (i.e., test re-test) were assessed. The largest kicking proficiency difference was between U13 and U16 players and between novice and sub-elite players. Between the ages of U16 and U18 kicking proficiency appears to stabilise. The Australian football small-sided kicking assessment was 97% successful in identifying players as either novice or sub-elite. Larger physical performance (i.e., odometer, m/min−1 and %HIR) outputs were noted between U14 and U18 players and novice and sub-elite players. Collectively, these findings suggest the Australian football small-sided kicking assessment is a valid and reliable AF kicking proficiency assessment tool and may provide worthwhile information to coaches regarding kicking performance along the AFL pathway, to profile player strengths whilst identifying specific areas of improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2980338970,Proposed injury thresholds for concussion in equestrian sports,2019-10-16,2019,article,"Equestrian helmets are designed to pass certification standards based on linear drop tests onto rigid steel surfaces. However, concussions in equestrian sports occur most commonly when a rider is thrown off a horse and obliquely impacts a compliant surface such as turf or sand. This paper seeks to elucidate the mechanics of such impacts and thereby propose corresponding thresholds for the occurrence of concussion that can improve equestrian helmet standards and designs.The present study examined the biomechanics of real-world equestrian accidents and developed thresholds for the occurrence of concussive injury.Twenty-five concussive and 25 non-concussive falls in equestrian sports were reconstructed using a combination of video analysis, computational and physical reconstruction methods. These represented male and female accidents from horse racing and the cross-country phase of eventing.The resulting thresholds for concussion [59g, 2700rad/s2, 28rad/s, 0.24 (MPS), 6.6kPa and 0.27 (CSMD10) for 50% risk] were consistent with those reported in the literature and represent a unique combination of head kinematic thresholds compared to other sports. Current equestrian helmet standards commonly use a threshold of 250g and a linear drop to a steel anvil resulting in less than 15ms impacts. This investigation found that concussive equestrian accidents occurred from oblique impacts to turf or sand with lower magnitude and longer duration impacts (<130g and >20ms). This suggests that current equestrian helmet standards may not adequately represent real-world concussive impact conditions and, consequently, there is an urgent need to assess the protective capacity of equestrian helmets under real-world conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2980742361,Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg: Using Systems Archetypes to Understand Common and Recurring Issues in Sports Coaching,2019-10-16,2019,review,"Systems thinking, a fundamental approach for understanding complexity is gaining traction in sport science. Systems archetypes (SAs) describe common recurring patterns of system behaviours and explain the systemic influences on behaviour. SAs look at the deeper levels of systemic structure by identifying what creates system behaviours, which supports the development of interventions to identify and resolve problem sources. Four commonly used SAs were used to explain the dynamics underpinning recurring issues for coaching in sport: Fixes that Fail, Shifting the burden, Drifting goals, and Success to the successful, using football specific examples. The SAs models were built, refined and validated by seven subject matter experts including experienced football researchers, systems thinking experts, an international football coach, a skill acquisition specialist, and an exercise scientist. The findings show that SAs fit well in the football coaching context, providing further evidence that a complex system thinking approach is required when considering football performance and its optimisation. The developed SAs identify the factors that play a role in recurring issues in football coaching and highlight the systemic structures that contribute to the issues. Systemic problems often arise in football when quick fixes are attempted. Whereas, improvements to system behaviour usually require a delay after the implementation of the appropriate corrective action. The SAs developed in the current study also provide practical templates of common problems in football that can be used to prompt discussions around how to avoid common, but ineffective interventions and instead make sustainable improvements across multiple aspects of football performance."

Articles published before August 2018 were considered in our review. The PubMed, SCOPUS, SportDiscus and Medline databases were searched. A combination of the following search terms was used: virtual reality, virtual environment, virtual system, athletes, sports, physical training, sport performance, physical exercises. Studies involved healthy competitive athletes. A total of 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. There were three areas of application of virtual reality to sport: performance analysis, simulation improvement and virtual training. Competitive athletes were mostly examined in a semi-immersive setting. In conclusion, virtual reality seems to play a marginal role in competitive athletes' training. Due to the fact that virtual reality interventions bring significant improvements in clinical research, well-designed randomized control trials with detailed virtual training programmes are required in the future. Practically, virtual reality is effectively and commonly used to analyse performance in competitive athletes. There is still a need of creating fully interactive VR, where athletes will be able to cooperate with a virtual partner and influence the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2981513353,"Practical Use of the Navigate Pain Application for the Assessment of the Area, Location, and Frequency of the Pain Location in Young Soccer Goalkeepers",2019-10-15,2019,article,"Next to winning, minimizing injuries during training and matches is one of the primary goals of professional team sports games. Soreness and pain can be early indicators and risk factors for acute or long‐term injuries. Monitoring pain intensity and duration, as well as potential sources, are useful for planning practices and can be effective means for preventing injury. The aim of this study was to assess the areas and locations of pain in young soccer goalkeepers during a training camp, and to differentiate the area and frequency between pain arising from the muscles (MP), joints (JP), or as a result of an impact (IP). Recordings of the MP, JP, and IP location along with the area were performed using digital body mapping software (Navigate Pain Android app, Aalborg University, Denmark) installed on a tablet personal computer at the end of each training day across a 5‐day training camp. There was a significant difference in the area between the three types of pain (p < 0.001). The post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the pixel areas of IP versus JP (p < 0.001), IP versus MP (p < 0.001), and JP versus MP (p < 0.001). There was no significant time‐effect for the IP area between 1‐5 days of training (p = 0.610), neither for MP (p = 0.118) or JP (p = 0.797) and no significant difference for all three pain areas between the front and the back side of the body. The body regions most often reported for MP were thighs, while for JP they were groin and hips, and for IP the hips, shoulders, and forearms were most frequently indicated. This is the first study to map and report the pain distribution associated with training across a 5‐day training camp in soccer goalkeepers, and these findings emphasize the value of using digital pain drawings clinically as well as for monitoring the health status of soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W2979723819,How to Evaluate and Improve Foot Strength in Athletes: An Update,2019-10-11,2019,review,"The foot is a complex system with multiple degrees of freedom that play an essential role in running or sprinting. The intrinsic foot muscles (IFM) are the main local stabilizers of the foot and are part of the active and neural subsystems that constitute the foot core. These muscles lengthen eccentrically during the stance phase of running before shortening at the propulsion phase, as the arch recoils in parallel to the plantar fascia. They play a key role in supporting the medial longitudinal arch, providing flexibility, stability and shock absorption to the foot, whilst partially controlling pronation. Much of the foot rigidity in late stance has been attributed to the windlass mechanism - the dorsiflexion of the toes building tension up in the plantar aponeurosis and stiffening the foot. In addition, recent studies have shown that the IFM provide a necessary active contribution in late stance, in order to develop sufficient impedance in the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. This in turn facilitates the propulsive forces at push-off. These factors support the critical role of the foot in providing rigidity and an efficient lever at push-off. During sprinting, athletes need to generate and maintain the highest (linear) running velocity during a single effort in a sprinting lane. Acceleration and sprinting performance requires forces to be transmitted efficiently to the ground. It may be of particular interest to strengthen foot muscles to maintain and improve an optimal capacity to generate and absorb these forces. The current evidence supports multiple exercises to achieve higher strength in the foot, such as the ""short foot exercise"", toes curl, toes extension or even minimalist running. Their real impact on foot muscle strength remains unclear and data related to its assessment remains scarce, despite a recognized need for this, especially before and after a strengthening intervention. It would be optimal to be able to assess it. In this article, we aim to provide the track and field community with an updated review on the current modalities available for foot strength assessment and training. We present recommendations for the incorporation of foot muscles training for performance and injury prevention."

Anterior circulate ligament is the most frequently injured knee ligament accounting for approximately 50% of all ligament injuries; however, post stroke anterior cruciate ligament injury is rarely reported. We present a case of a 58-year-old female admitted for inpatient stoke rehabilitation after a left middle cerebral artery stroke. After gaining considerable functional recovery, she was planned to be discharged in two weeks' time when she tripped resulting in a torn anterior cruciate ligament on the hemiperetic side. This resulted in increase in the length of stay and loss of functional gains. We discuss the possible mechanisms and the management plan. Patients with stroke should be monitored for musculoskeletal complications and preventive strategies should be devised to protect from possible ligamentous injuries of the knees."
https://openalex.org/W2980215369,An improved method for obtaining rotational accelerations from instrumented headforms,2019-10-10,2019,article,"Abstract The following compares the effect of differentiation methods used to acquire angular acceleration from three types of un-helmeted headform impact tests. The differentiation methods considered were the commonly used 5-point stencil method and a total variation regularization method. Both methods were used to obtain angular acceleration by differentiating angular velocity measured by three angular rate sensors (gyroscopes), and a reference angular acceleration signal was obtained from an array of nine linear accelerometers (that do not require differentiation to obtain angular acceleration). For each impact, three injury criteria that use angular acceleration as an input were calculated from the three angular acceleration signals. The effect of the differentiation methods were considered by comparing the criteria values obtained from gyroscope data to those obtained from the reference signal. Agreement with reference values was observed to be greater for the TV method when a user-defined tuning parameter was optimized for the impact test and cutoff frequency of each condition, particularly at higher cutoff frequencies. In this case, mean absolute error of the five-point stencil ranged from 1.0 (the same) to 11.4 times larger than that associated with the TV method. When a constant tuning parameter value was used across all impacts and cutoff frequencies considered in this study, the TV method still provided a significant improvement over the 5-point stencil method, achieving mean absolute errors as low as one-tenth that observed for the five-point stencil method."

However, these global measures do not provide direct information on the passive muscle mechanical properties of individual muscle. This characterization is crucial to better understand the effect of interventions as selective adaptations may occur among synergist muscles. Taking advantage of shear wave elastography, we aimed to determine whether elite sport athletes exhibit different passive shear modulus of hamstring heads compared to controls. Passive shear modulus was measured on semitendinosus (ST), semimembranosus (SM), and biceps femoris (BF) using shear wave elastography with the knee flexed at 60° and 90°, and 90° of hip flexion. A total of 97 elite athletes from various sports including running sprint, figure skating, fencing, field hockey, taekwondo, basketball, and soccer and 12 controls were evaluated. The shear modulus measured at 60° of knee flexion was lower in SM for figure skating ( P &lt; .001; d = 1.8), taekwondo ( P &lt; .001; d = 2.1), fencing ( P = .024; d = 1.0), and soccer ( P = .011; d = 0.9) compared to controls, while no difference was found for athletic sprinters, field hockey, and basketball players. Shear modulus of the BF and ST muscle was not significantly different between controls and elite athletes, regardless of the sport specialization (all P values = 1). We provide evidence that the shear modulus of the SM is altered in athletes involved in elite sport practice performed over large range of motion and/or including substantial stretching program in training content (taekwondo, figure skating, fencing, and soccer)."
https://openalex.org/W2980255914,Interspecies Sustainability to Ensure Animal Protection: Lessons from the Thoroughbred Racing Industry,2019-10-08,2019,article,"There is a disconnect between dominant conceptions of sustainability and the protection of animals arising from the anthropocentric orientation of most conceptualisations of sustainability, including sustainable development. Critiques of this disconnect are primarily based in the context of industrial animal agriculture and a general model of a species-inclusive conception of sustainability has yet to emerge. The original contribution of this article is two-fold: First, it develops a theoretical framework for interspecies sustainability. Second, it applies this to a case study of the thoroughbred racing industry. Interviews were conducted with thoroughbred industry and animal advocacy informants in the US, Australia and Great Britain. While industry informants claim thoroughbred welfare is seminal for industry sustainability, they adopt a market-oriented anthropocentric conception of sustainability and do not consider animal welfare a sustainability domain in its own right. Animal advocacy informants demonstrate a deeper understanding of welfare but some express discomfort about linking sustainability, welfare and racing. Eight analytical layers have been identified in the discourse in the interface of sustainability and animal protection, of which two have transformational potential to advance interspecies sustainability. Interspecies sustainability urgently needs to be advanced to ensure animal protection in the sustainability transition, and to not leave the defining of animal welfare and sustainability to animal industries."

However, it is unknown whether this type of app-based instruction facilitates similar acute neuromuscular and biomechanical characteristics of the preventive exercises as achieved when instructed on-site by an expert. Thus, the aim was to evaluate acute neuromuscular characteristics observed during a single bout of selected lower extremity injury preventive exercises instructed by an on-screen app versus on-site individual instruction provided by a physiotherapist. In a cross-sectional study design, 47 female football and handball players were randomly assigned to receive app instruction (APP group) or on-site instruction provided by a physiotherapist (PHY group) while performing five lower extremity injury preventive exercises. The exercises performed comprised (1) one-legged balance on Airex, (2) vertical drop jump, (3) one-legged horizontal jump onto floor, (4) one-legged horizontal jump onto Airex, and (5) two-hand Kettlebell Swing. Primary outcome was hamstring (biceps femoris and semitendinosus) muscle activity. Secondary outcomes were quadriceps (vastus lateralis and medialis) muscle activity, as well as hip and knee joint angles. Muscle activity was monitored by surface electromyography (EMG) and normalized to the peak amplitude obtained during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC). Hip and knee joint angles were recorded by a 3D motion analysis system. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the differences between experimental conditions for each outcome variable. Medial hamstring (semitendinosus) muscle activity was significantly higher during one-legged jump onto Airex (17 percentage points (95% CI 7 to 27)) and Kettlebell Swing (19 percentage points (95% CI 2 to 36)) in the PHY group than the APP group. Likewise, the PHY group demonstrated 18 percentage points (95% CI 1 to 35) and 19 percentage points (95% CI 0 to 38), greater lateral quadriceps muscle (vastus lateralis) activity during one-legged jump onto floor and one-legged jump onto Airex, respectively, compared with that of the APP group. Complex exercises, i.e., Kettlebell Swing and one-legged jump onto Airex, are characterized by lower neuromuscular activity when using app-based instructions compared with on-site instruction provided by a physiotherapist. However, the effectiveness of app-based instruction versus on-site individual instruction in injury prevention interventions remains to be investigated in future longitudinally studies."

Methods A total of 27 recreationally active males were recruited across two separate studies. For study 1, 13 participants (mean ± SD = 84.1 ± 9.4 kg, 22 ± 3 yr) completed two 4-min treadmill running bouts (2 min at 12 and 15 km·h −1 ) under two conditions: a no-compression control (CON 1 ) and compression (COMP). For study 2, 14 participants (77.8 ± 8.4 kg, 27 ± 5 yr) completed four 9-min treadmill running bouts (3 min at 8, 10, and 12 km·h −1 ) under four conditions: a no-compression control (CON 2 ) and three different commercially available compression tights (2XU, Nike, and Under Armor). Using Vicon 3D motion capture technology, lower limb muscle displacement was investigated in both study 1 (thigh and calf) and study 2 (vastus lateralis + medialis [VAS]; lateral + medial gastrocnemius [GAS]). In addition, study 2 investigated the effects of compression on soft tissue vibrations (root-mean-square of resultant acceleration, RMS A r ), muscle activation (iEMG), and running economy (oxygen consumption, V˙O 2 ) during treadmill running. Results Wearing compression during treadmill running reduced thigh and calf muscle displacement as compared with no compression (both studies), which was evident across all running speeds. Compression also reduced RMS A r and iEMG during treadmill running, but it had no effect on running economy (study 2). Conclusion Lower limb compression garments are effective in reducing muscle displacement, soft tissue vibrations, and muscle activation associated with the impact forces experienced during running."

However, current interventions remain poorly guided by evidence. Our objective was to quantify heading exposure in youth football, assessing the effects of sex and age. Football matches played during an international youth football tournament with no heading restrictions were directly observed, including players from both sexes (11‐19 years). The elite senior level was included for comparison, using video analysis. All heading events were registered, classified, and assigned to individual players. Heading rates were calculated for each sex and age group. We observed a total of 267 matches, corresponding to 4011 player hours (1927 player hours for females, 2083 player hours for males). Males headed more frequently than females (2.7 vs 1.8 headers/player hour; P &lt; .001). Heading rates increased with age (ANOVA, P &lt; .001), approaching the elite senior level for players 16 years and older. There was substantial variation within teams for all age and sex groups, with the widest range (1‐18 headers) observed for girls aged 19. Girls younger than 12 years had the lowest exposure, with an average of &lt;2 players per team heading the ball, each with 1‐2 headers. In conclusion, age and sex influence head impact exposure in youth football, and warrants careful consideration when introducing injury prevention measures. Males are more frequently exposed than females, heading rates increase with age, and there is substantial variation between players. Heading is a rare event in the youngest age groups, especially among females."

Studies were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) The studies were written in or translated to English; (2) The term bicep tendon rupture must be present in the title; (3) The abstract must include the name of the surgical repair technique used; and (4) Bicep tendon pain or dysfunction must be the chief complaint. Exclusion criteria consisted of any study that included a surgical repair to a rotator cuff muscle. Data extraction . All the studies that met the inclusion criteria were collected and evaluated using the Coleman Method scale. First each study was read completely without the use of the Coleman Method scoring checklist. Next, each article was read a second time using the Coleman Method scoring checklist by both evaluators. Based on the check list the studies were awarded points on whether the scored information was included. Finally when all of the studies were scored the two evaluators come together and compared their scores for each study and discrepancies were discussed until an agreement was reached. Data synthesis. The ten studies that were collected varied in subject population, type of surgical procedure performed was either a tenotomy or tenodesis, and whether the study conducted was a prospective or retrospective design and level of methodological quality. The subject population of the studies varied from 12 to 307. The Methodological quality of the studies according to the Coleman Method score ranged from 12 to 76, with the average mean score of 63.9. Conclusion. There is a lack of high quality methodological studies in the current literature, although some quality studies do exist. However, the number of quality studies is small making it difficult to draw strong conclusions as to which surgical technique provides the best outcome for the patient."
https://openalex.org/W2981452501,Health Consequences of Youth Sport Specialization,2019-10-01,2019,review,"Sport specialization is a training method now commonly used by young athletes who hope to achieve elite-level success. This may be defined as (1) choosing a main sport, (2) quitting all other sports to focus on 1 sport, and (3) year-round training (greater than 8 months per year). A number of sports medicine organizations have published recommendations based on the limited evidence available on this topic. The objective of this article was to perform a narrative review of the currently available evidence and sports medicine organizational recommendations regarding sport specialization and its effects on health to guide athletic trainers and sports medicine providers. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a narrative review of articles and position statements on sport specialization published from 1990 through 2018. Injury, overuse injury, serious overuse injury, and lower extremity injury were likely associated with higher degrees of sport specialization in various populations. Sports medicine organizations in general recommended against sport specialization in young athletes and instead promoted multisport participation for physical and psychological benefits. Few long-term data suggest that sport specialization has negative health-related quality-of-life consequences. Higher degrees of sport specialization likely pose risks of overuse injury; however, the age of specialization at which this risk occurs is not known. Because different populations and sports activities may put children at risk for certain injuries, future researchers should monitor large populations with sport-specific prospective active surveillance."

Objective To compare jump-landing biomechanics between adult recreational athletes who previously participated in 0, 1, or 2 or more select high school varsity sports (VSs; basketball, lacrosse, soccer, volleyball) that feature landing and cutting tasks. Design Descriptive laboratory study. Setting University community setting. Patients or Other Participants Fifty adult recreational athletes (22 women, 28 men; age = 23.8 ± 2.5 years) with no high school VS experience or with high school VS experience in basketball, lacrosse, soccer, or volleyball. Athletes were grouped into those who participated in 0 (0VS, n = 11), 1 (1VS, n = 21), or 2 or more (2VSs, n = 18) of these sports at the high school level. Main Outcome Measure(s) The average Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) total score from 3 individual jump landings was determined. A 1-way analysis of covariance using sex as the covariate was calculated to compare groups. The Pearson R was used to test for the correlation between the LESS score and number of sports played, and a linear regression analysis was performed using the number of sports played to predict the LESS score. The α level was set a priori at .05. Results The 0VS athletes produced similar LESS scores as the 1VS athletes (5.89 ± 1.2 versus 5.38 ± 1.93 points, respectively, P = .463), whereas the 2VSs athletes demonstrated lower LESS scores (3.56 ± 1.97 points) than the 0VS (P = .002) and 1VS (P = .004) athletes. The LESS scores were moderately negatively correlated with the number of high school VSs played (R2 = −0.491, P &amp;lt; .001). The linear regression analysis was significant (F1,37 = 9.416, P = .004) with R2 = 0.203. For every additional VS played at the high school level, the LESS score decreased by 1.28 points. Conclusions Landing Error Scoring System scores were lower in athletes who had a history of multisport high school varsity participation in basketball, lacrosse, soccer, or volleyball compared with those who had a history of single-sport or no participation in these sports at this level. Multisport high school varsity participation in these sports may result in improved neuromuscular performance and potentially reduced injury risks as adults."
https://openalex.org/W2979160488,Biomechanical mechanisms of jumping performance in youth elite female soccer players,2019-10-01,2019,article,"We aimed to determine key biomechanical parameters explaining age-related jumping performance differences in youth elite female soccer players. Multiple biomechanical parameters from countermovement (CMJ) squat (SJ) and drop (DJ) jump testing of elite female soccer players (n = 60) within the same national training centre were analysed across ages 9-11y, 12-14y and 15-19y. Effects of age group and jump type on jump height were found, with the older jumping higher than the younger groups in all jumps (P < 0.05). For DJ, higher reactive strength index was found for older, compared to each younger group (P < 0.001). For CMJ and SJ, peak power was the most decisive characteristic, with significant differences between each group for absolute peak power (P < 0.0001) and body-weight-normalised peak power in CMJ (57 ± 7W/kg, 50 ± 7W/kg, 44.7 ± 5.5W/kg; P < 0.05) and between the older and each younger group in SJ (56.7 ± 7.1W/kg, 48.9 ± 7.1W/kg, 44.6 ± 6W/kg; P < 0.01). Age-related differences in jumping performance in youth elite female soccer players appear to be due to power production during standing jumps and by the ability to jump with shorter ground contact times during reactive jumps."

Traumatic brain injury impacts cerebral metabolism and a number of research groups have successfully used this technique as a biomarker of injury and/or outcome in both pediatric and adult TBI populations. However, this technique is underutilized, with studies being performed primarily at centers with access to MR research support. In this paper we present a technical introduction to the acquisition and analysis of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy and review magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in different injury populations. In addition, we propose a basic data acquisition scheme that can be added to any imaging protocol, regardless of clinical magnetic resonance platform. We outline a number of considerations for study design as a way of encouraging the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the study of traumatic brain injury, as well as recommendations to improve data harmonization across groups already using this technique."

Identifying quantitative measures of recovery has become a point of interest in treatment. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), the average fluctuation in the interval between heartbeats, shows promise as a noninvasive biomarker. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Case report following cardiovascular recovery of a 15 year old cross country runner 4 months post-injury. Average heart rate and maximum heart rate per training session were collected from the patient9s smart device. <h3>Results</h3> A 15-year-old Caucasian male cross-country runner hit the back of his head during a soccer game suffering an MTBI. The patient rested from the activity for 1 week then returned to training. Two months after the injury the patient complained of persistent shortness of breath, fatigue, and increased heart rate while running. According to the patient, his average BPM while running prior to the injury was in the 160s. The patient9s smart device post-concussion reports a spike into the 180s. 3 months post-concussion the patient was instructed to keep his heart rate below 170 during training.

Objective To conduct a kinesiological analysis of specific exercises for the pelvic floor muscles (PFM), proposing correspondences of these postures through resistance exercises. Methods This research project is of a descriptive nature with level of evidence V. Videos and photos were taken to obtain an image for the collection of data based on the accomplishment of the specific postures. Results The kinesiological study revealed that the muscles involved in the postures of exercises targeting the prevention of urinary incontinence beyond those specific to the pelvic floor were: trunk flexors; spinal erector; adductors and hip extensors. The resistance exercises corresponding to these positions in bodybuilding apparatus were the machine hack squat; sitting adductor exercises; sitting abductor exercises; the smith machine squat and the free squat or machine squat. Conclusion This study showed that it is possible to construct correspondence between exercises for the pelvic floor muscles and resistance exercises with bodybuilding equipment and free weights.

However, limited information exists on the relationship between these biomarkers at short time points post-injury, and detectability in saliva of mTBI patients. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Biomarker analysis of serum from a total of 120 participants, derived from two independent sample groups consisting of 60 concussion/mTBI patients each, with blood collected within 1-4 hr and 8-16 hr post-injury, respectively, was compared with 30 healthy control sera. Saliva samples were collected after 8-16 hr post-injury from a n = 30 subset of the same patients. Quanterix Simoa 4-plex immunoassay was used for highly sensitive measurements of these biomarkers. <h3>Results</h3> Median levels of NF-L, GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher in independent sets of patient serum samples (n = 60 each), both at early (1–4 hr) and later (8–16 hr) time points post-mTBI/concussion, relative to control samples (n = 30) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001, = 0.0001, &lt;0.0001, respectively). Low levels of t-Tau are detected, but are significantly elevated post-concussion relative to controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0001). Significant correlations were observed between levels of t-Tau and UCH-L1, NF-L and GFAP, and t-Tau and GFAP in both post-injury time-point groups, and between NF-L and UCH-L1 levels in the 8-16 hr group. The four biomarkers were detected in saliva from concussion/mTBI patients (n = 30). <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study supports the utility of ultra-sensitive multiplex immunoassays to detect increases in CNS proteins at high sensitivity in serum and saliva within 1-4 and 8-16 hr of concussion/mTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2977931199,Symptom Provocation Patterns During Supervised Exercise in Adolescent Athletes with Concussion,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To understand which exercises provoke symptoms, as well as the type and frequency of symptoms, during supervised exercise (SE) following concussion, and to better understand how to interpret and utilize findings during SE. <h3>Background</h3> Exercise is increasingly used in the management of sport-related concussion, and SE has been shown to be associated with faster clearance to return to sport. However, the optimal use of exercise following concussion is not known, and findings during SE have not been studied. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> This study is a retrospective review of patients seen at a sport concussion clinic. Participants were concussed athletes under age 18 who underwent SE within 30 days of concussion. A typical SE session began with a basic cardiovascular exercise followed by dynamic exercise challenges. Data recorded included exercise type, pre-exercise symptoms, symptom exacerbation scores, and maximum heart rate during exercise. A symptom was considered provoked if a new symptom developed or if an existing symptom increased by ≥3 points on a 10 point scale. Outcome measures were referral to vestibular physical therapy and the number of days from concussion until clearance for return to sport. Data were analyzed using two-sample t tests, linear and logistic regression models. <h3>Results</h3> 66.2% of patients experienced symptom provocation during SE. Symptom provocation did not occur until the dynamic challenge portion of the workout in 55.6% of those symptomatic. Dizziness was the most common symptom (48.5%), and medicine ball exercises (50.0%) the most common provoking exercise. Dizziness provoked during SE predicted referral to vestibular physical therapy (OR 5.90, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Provocation of symptoms during basic cardiovascular exercises predicted a greater number of days until clearance for return to sport (<i>p</i> = 0.015). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Symptom provocation during SE provides useful information in return to play decision making, guidance for physical thearpy treatments, and prognostication of recovery time following concussion."

However, no one has longitudinally assessed recovery following concussion in male athletes with fhNDD. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Data from the NCAA-DOD Grand Alliance: Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) Consortium were used to compared male athletes with (n = 51) and without (n = 102) a family history of neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Non-Alzheimer's Dementia, and Mild Cognitive Impairment). All athletes completed baseline ImPACT assessments prior to the beginning of their sporting season. Athletes that sustained a concussion were then re-evaluated 24-48 hours post-injury, prior to un-restricted return to play (RTP), and again 6 months post-injury. Athletes without fhNDD were double matched based on age, body mass index, sport category, and concussion history. <h3>Results</h3> Repeated measures ANCOVA models were used to evaluate performance at each post-injury timepoint, while controlling for baseline performance. A group × time interaction was observed for visual memory performance. Post-hoc univariate analyses revealed that male athletes with fhNDD demonstrated significantly poorer visual memory performance 24–48 hours post-injury compared to controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.005). Additionally, we found a main effect of group for impulse control, indicating that male athletes with fhNDD demonstrated an increase number of impulse errors at all three post-injury evaluations (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.004). We did not to observe any other group differences (<i>p's</i> &gt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results suggest that male athletes with a family history of neurodegenerative disease may exhibit greater post-injury cognitive deficits compared to controls. Additionally, some deficits may persist for at least 6 months post-injury. Further research is warranted to investigate the interaction between family history of neurodegenerative disease and concussion."
https://openalex.org/W2979045676,The Influence of Hormonal Contraceptives on Cognitive Recovery in Concussed Collegiate Athletes: Data from the NCAA-DoD CARE Consortium,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To longitudinally examine the relation between hormonal contraceptives and concussion recovery. We hypothesized that female athletes using hormonal contraceptives would exhibit faster recovery times and smaller post-injury alterations in neurological status, cognition, and clinical symptoms than female athletes not using hormonal contraceptives. <h3>Background</h3> Research indicates sex may moderate concussion outcomes, with some females experiencing protracted recovery relative to males. It is hypothesized that fluctuations of sex hormones lead to poorer outcomes in these females. Thus, female athletes taking hormonal contraceptives may exhibit better recovery than their un-medicated counterparts, as their hormone levels are artificially stabilized. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Data from the NCAA-DOD Grand Alliance: Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) Consortium were used to evaluate female athletes who were (n = 50) and were not (n = 50) taking hormonal contraceptives. Baseline assessments were completed prior to athletes' sport season. Athletes were re-assessed 24–48 hours post-concussion, and again at the unrestricted return-to-play. Length of recovery was defined as days between injury and the unrestricted return-to-play. Neurological status was measured using the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC). Cognitive function and clinical symptoms were measured using the ImPACT test. Participants were matched on age, sex, body mass index, sport, and concussion history. <h3>Results</h3> No group differences in length of recovery were observed (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Across all timepoints, analyses revealed main effects of group for concentration (SAC; <i>p</i> = 0.04), verbal memory (ImPACT; <i>p</i> = 0.03), and cognitive efficiency (ImPACT; <i>p</i> = 0.01). No differences in change scores (relative to baseline) were observed between groups. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The current results suggest that hormonal contraceptives do not influence concussion recovery. However, irrespective of injury status, our findings indicate that females on hormonal contraceptives may exhibit better concentration, working memory, and cognitive efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2979168937,Association between Concussion Profiles and Neurocognitive Functioning,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the relationship between concussion profiles and neurocognitive functioning, as measured by CNS Vital Signs (CNSVS). <h3>Background</h3> The heterogeneity of clinical presentation following concussion poses a challenge for treating clinicians. Kontos and Collins proposed a model in which initial global symptoms delineate into specific clinical trajectories, termed concussion profiles. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> The study was a retrospective, blind review of patient data from a concussion specialty clinic. Clinicians determined if patients met criterion for a profile, and identified the primary profile. One-way ANOVA's were used to determine the overall effect of concussion profile on CNSVS multi-test domains. Omega-squared (ω2) was used as an estimate of the overall effect size: 0.01 (small), 0.06 (medium), 0.14 (large). Hedge's g was used post-hoc to determine the effect size of mean differences between profiles on each domain: 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), 0.8 (large). <h3>Results</h3> Data consisted of 88 participants obtained from the UF Concussion and Sports program (median age = 26.5; IQR, 18.0–51.8; 90% Caucasian; Median days since injury = 71, IQR, 38–155). Headache/migraine was the most prevalent primary profile (23%), while cognitive was the least prevalent (8%). The cognitive profile was associated with worse scores on the neurocognitive index (ω2 = 0.008; g = 0.71–1.04), reaction time (ω2 = 0.081; g = 0.60–1.21), memory (ω2 = 0.016; g = 0.50–0.96), psychomotor speed (ω2 = 0.023; g = 0.34–0.62), complex attention (ω2 = 0.026; g = 0.30–0.72), and cognitive flexibility (ω2 = 0.029; g = 0.36–0.65) domains relative to other profiles. The vestibular (g = 0.39–0.83) and anxiety/mood profiles (g = 0.33–0.76) were associated with worse reaction time relative to all other profiles except cognitive. Lastly, the headache/migraine profile was associated with worse complex attention (g = 0.26–0.53) and cognitive flexibility (g = 0.29–0.65) relative to other profiles except cognitive. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The cognitive profile is characterized by global cognitive deficits, while deficits in other profiles are domain-specific. Clinicians should consider the role of non-cognitive profiles when interpreting neurocognitive scores."
https://openalex.org/W2977370974,Thalamic and thalamic projection abnormalities on DTI and NODDI analysis following acute concussion,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To compare preseason and post-concussive MRI in a cohort of collegiate football players utilizing Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) post processing. <h3>Background</h3> Acute post-concussive symptoms can vary in clinical characteristics and severity. However, vestibular and ocular dysfunction in particular, has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. The vestibular system comprises a complex network of projections from peripheral vestibular organs to thalamic relay systems and numerous cortical regions. The visual/oculomotor system is also complex, involving brainstem, subcortical-cortical and thalamo-cortical connections. Oculomotor deficits are thought to involve the midbrain and the visual and parietal association cortices, both of which have thalamic projections. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We gathered pre-season MR diffusion weighted imaging on a cohort of 30 collegiate football players. We performed repeat imaging within 36 hours of any diagnosed concussion in the same subject cohort. DTI metrics: mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) along with NODDI metric: orientation dispersion index (ODI), were analyzed for statistical comparisons between groups. <h3>Results</h3> 4 subjects with pre-season MRI underwent repeat MRI within 36 hours of concussive injury. A paired t-test between these two groups using DTI and NODDI metrics showed significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) decreases in: AD and MD in the left posterior thalamic radiations, FA in the column and body of the fornix, and MD in the right anterior corona radiata and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and a significant decrease in ODI in the anterior thalamus. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Disruptions in the thalamus and its white matter projections may play a role in the vestibular/ocular dysfunction associated with acute concussive injury. While our numbers are small, the findings suggest that DTI and NODDI processing techniques have the capability to locate and measure grey and white matter injury patterns after concussive injury."

The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) suggests using the Modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS) or Timed Tandem Gait (TTG) to evaluate balance function. TTG instructions indicate that times &gt;14 seconds are abnormal as established in individuals between 16-37 years of age (Schneiders et al., 2010). Currently, there is a lack of normative data for the pediatric population. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Pre-season TTG data were collected from 363 male and 20 female athletes with no active concussion complaints. The best TTG time out of 4 trials without errors was recorded. In addition, post-season data were collected for 107 male athletes. <h3>Results</h3> Results demonstrated a significant decrease in TTG time with age. Given this improvement, separate expected values were constructed: 7–8 years (21.4 +/− 7 s), 9–10 years (18.56 +/− 6 s), 11–12 years (18 +/− 5 s), 13–14 years (15.8 +/− 4 s), and 15–16 years (14.0 +/− 3 s). Analysis showed a significant improvement in TTG time over the season. Preliminary analysis shows no difference between baseline and post-concussion scores. <h3>Conclusions</h3> These results suggest that TTG time should be established annually. Future research will need to explore the expected amount of change in individuals with post-concussion imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W2977466065,Visual Evoked Potential and Voltage Changes Associated with Acute Concussion and Frequency Specific Photophobia,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> In this paper we present a case series of concussion patients9 VEP as well as a single concussion patient with a VEP baseline and post concussion VEP data. <h3>Background</h3> Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) are a means of measuring the electrical behavior of the brain following a visual stimuli. The use of VEP for diagnostics following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is emerging with additional data concerning sports related concussion coming. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> During the 2016 spring football season there was 1 concussion of a subject who had a VEP baseline and a VEP performed during the acute phase of the concussion. Concurrently we have been using VEP for concussion patients who have not had a baseline. Fifteen subjects in the post acute phase; while symptomatic, had VEP performed using White, Red, Blue and Green for the evoked potentials. <h3>Results</h3> The patient with a VEP baseline had increased voltages with subtle slowing of N75 and P100. N75 increased from 67.5 msec at baseline to 75.1 msec post concussion. Voltages went from 19.3 mVolts to 24.6 mVolts post concussion. Also, the colored flashes associated with the lowest voltages were consistent with mitigation of frequency specific photophobia; 20.9 mVolts for mitigation color compared (red) to 24.6 for white. In the concussion population studied (N = 15) the voltages where the color corresponded to symptom relief were: 10.9 ± 5.7 mVolts compared to symptom evoking voltages 12.7 ± 6.3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0031) mVolts. <h3>Conclusions</h3> In this paper we present evidence of VEP changes in one acute concussion patient as well as a population of concussion patients where voltages are increased post concussion. The increased voltages associated with color VEP may be a useful technique to assess frequency specific photophobia as well as helping manage post concussion photophobia. Futures studies to assess the utility of VEP as a concussion management tool are needed."

A total of five articles resulted and were reviewed. <h3>Results</h3> A 14yo female with a concussion from volleyball had a protracted course of recovery due to anxiety. Months later, she was struck by a tennis ball without a second concussion. She developed a non-physiologic stutter and atasia-abasia. She recovered with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A 16yo female with history of depression sustained a concussion playing soccer with an associated slurred speech. Two weeks later, her initial concussion symptoms resolved however she began stuttering. She was treated by adjusting her psychiatric medications. Two years later she sustained another concussion which caused a reoccurrence of stuttering. Symptoms improved after a partial day program with psychiatry and intensive speech therapy. An 18yo male wrestler with no psychiatric history suffered a concussion. He developed catatonia with echolalia. He was unable to participate in CBT, however symptoms have partially improved with diazepam. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This series highlights pediatric athletes presenting with functional speech disorders after concussion or an event triggering anxiety of concussion. The development of conversion disorder of speech was independent of any pre-disposing psychiatric history. Psychological treatment with CBT or medication successfully improved conditions in all cases. Providers should counsel patients and families of potential stress-response symptoms that can occur with concussion. Ongoing research is needed to establish patterns of these conditions and provide evidenced based guidelines to best direct treatment of these young athletes."

Clinicians often treat PTH with drugs approved for primary headache disorders, and many patients self-treat with over-the-counter agents but have inadequate pain relief. There has been little study of therapies for PTH, and safe, effective treatments are needed. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> This randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group pilot study is enrolling adults who present 1–4 weeks after a head injury, meet International Classification of Headache Disorders 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (ICHD-3) criteria for acute headache attributed to mild TBI, and have ≥2 headaches/week with a migraine or probable migraine phenotype. After a 2-week run-in period, subjects are randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to receive daily preventive therapy and as-needed acute treatment with nVNS or a sham device. Preventive therapy consists of two 120-second stimulations 3 times daily. Acute treatment comprises 2 stimulations at headache onset and 2 stimulations 20 minutes after the start of initial treatment. Subjects are not to use acute rescue medication for 120 minutes post-treatment. One North American site will enroll ≤80 subjects. The expected duration is 12 months (enrollment, 9 months; participation, 14 weeks). <h3>Results</h3> The primary effectiveness end point is decrease in pain (on a 7-point scale) 60 minutes post-treatment for all treated headache attacks. Secondary end points include decrease in the frequency of headache days between the run-in period and the last 2 weeks of the double-blind period and responder rates (ie, percentages of subjects with ≥50% decrease in attack frequency). The primary safety end point is the incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study will assess the efficacy and safety of nVNS as a novel therapy for PTH."
https://openalex.org/W2977775979,A video review of cognitive factors contributing to concussive impacts in sport,2019-10-01,2019,review,"<h3>Objective</h3> To explore cognitive factors contributing to concussive impacts in athletes. <h3>Background</h3> Cognitive training programs are becoming an increasingly popular strategy for improving athletic performance. Such programs may have potential to decrease athletes' concussion risk by improving athletes' ability to avoid and appropriately react to imminent impacts in the athletic environment. Understanding what cognitive factors contribute to concussive impacts may provide insight into the most appropriate cognitive training regimens for concussion risk reduction. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> YouTube videos depicting 100 concussive impacts in athletes were identified via Google video search. Two reviewers independently classified the primary cognitive factor contributing to each impact as one of the following: useful field of view (UFOV, unanticipated/unrecognized impacts coming from outside the athlete's field of view), field dependence (FD, unanticipated/unrecognized impacts resulting from the athlete's attention being so focused on an athletic task that the pending impact was not recognized), processing speed (PS, anticipated/recognized impacts occurring too quickly for the athlete to complete an evasive or protective maneuver), or motion perception (MP, anticipated/recognized impacts occurring with sufficient time to respond but associated with a poorly planned or implemented motor response). Descriptive statistics were calculated. <h3>Results</h3> 98 videos were reviewed to yield 100 concussive impacts. 98% of the concussed athletes were males. Concussions occurred during American football (53%), ice hockey (29%), soccer (3%), basketball (3%), as well as 9 other sports (12%). The most commonly contributing cognitive factor was MP (32%), followed by FD (30%), UFOV (23%), and PS (15%). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Multiple cognitive factors contribute to concussive impacts in athletes, with MP and FD being the most common in our sample. Cognitive training programs intending to reduce concussion risk in athletes should not focus only on one cognitive factor. Future work should also explore differences between sports and positions."
https://openalex.org/W2977833207,Use of a Questionnaire to Measure Concussion Knowledge in Brazilian adults,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> We aimed to evaluate the self-reported concussion knowledge of the general population, to observe and describe any gaps in the knowledge and misconceptions, and to identify the variables that influence the concussion knowledge. <h3>Background</h3> Concussion represents 80–90% of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) causes and its higher incidence is related to sports. The United States Centers for Disease Control estimates a TBI annual incidence ranging from 1.6 to 3.8 million cases, including concussions related to sport. Thus, it is seen as a public health priority. Adequate general population knowledge is a critical issue to correct diagnosis and management of concussion. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive survey. A Concussion knowledge Questionnaire (CKQ) was created to capture data on concussion identification and causes, concussion consequences, recovery and management, and sport-related concussion The number of the sample correct and incorrect answers was calculated to measure the percent of concussion knowledge by CKQ domain. <h3>Results</h3> The sample was formed by 1247 Brazilian adults with a mean age of 41.7 (±11.8) years and high level of schooling. The total score in the CKQ was a mean of 20 (±10) points, which corresponds to a rate of 41.6% of correct answers. Thus, there is poor knowledge in all domains of the CKQ. Only 35.5% of correct answers were registered regarding the main symptoms of a concussion. Similarly, the higher number of incorrect answers was related to questions about recovery and management of a concussion. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our study is the first to examine the concussion knowledge in a sample of Brazilian adults and provide useful information for development of concussion education programs. Our findings suggest very poor concussion knowledge in sample studied. More larger and meaningful research is needed to investigate the concussion knowledge and the variables that may interfere in the knowledge of the Brazilian general."
https://openalex.org/W2977935979,Head Impact Kinematics do not Predict In-Season Concussion or Lower Extremity Injury in Ice Hockey,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine if head impact kinematics (HIK) predict in-season concussion or acute lower extremity injury (LEI) in collegiate ice hockey. <h3>Background</h3> Sustaining head impacts in sport regularly may be damaging to long-term neurological health. Individuals who sustain higher head impact loads may be at increased risk for concussion, and furthermore, individuals who sustain a concussion are more likely to sustain a subsequent LEI than those without a history of concussion. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Twenty-nine collegiate club male ice hockey players (age: 20.2 ± 1.4) over the 2015-2018 seasons completed a survey at the conclusion of their season of LEI and concussion in-season. HIK (number of impacts, and mean, peak, and cumulative linear acceleration) were recorded via tri-axial accelerometers (Triax, Nowalk, CT) that each player wore for games/practices with a 10g impact threshold. Two binary logistic regressions were performed to determine if either sustaining a concussion or LEI was predicted by HIK. <h3>Results</h3> There was no relationship between LEI or concussion with number of impacts (β:-0.018, <i>p</i> = 0.711, 95% CI:-0.12-0.84; β:-0.039, <i>p</i> = 0.55, 95% CI: -0.21-0.08, respectively), or mean (β:0.041, <i>p</i> = 0.79, 95% CI: -0.26-0.38; β:-0.040, <i>p</i> = 0.81, 95% CI: -0.37-0.32), peak (β:-0.065, <i>p</i> = 0.14, 95% CI: -0.16-0.01; β:0.0007, <i>p</i> = 0.99, 95% CI: -0.09-0.09), or cumulative acceleration (β:0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.42, 95% CI: -0.001-0.004; β:0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.55, 95% CI:-0.002-0.005). 7/29 players sustained a LEI and 6/29 sustained a concussion. Mean value for number of impacts was 59.7 ± 49.1 (range:3-171); mean acceleration: 33.9 ± 5.3g (range:22.0-42.22), peak: 71.8 ± 19.0g (range: 30.8-108.4); cumulative: 2,108.5 ± 1,793.8g (range 71.8-6517.2). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The main finding of this study is that greater HIK do not predict whether individuals sustained either an acute LEI or concussion during the season, albeit from a small sample. As HIK load is related to concussion incidence, it is possible HIK load may also be related to LEI, however, these results suggest HIK alone is not related to either in an ice hockey cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2978314678,Factors Influencing Coaches’ Decisions about Concussion on the Sidelines of Youth Sports,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> Identify coach reported factors influencing decisions about potential concussion in youth sports. <h3>Background</h3> Youth concussion in sport is an established public health concern. Coaches are the primary stakeholders deciding about removal from play for suspected concussion on the sidelines of competition and practice in most youth sports organizations. Estimates indicate over 2 million adults coach youth sports. Legislation across the U.S. and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and the Concussion in Sport Group recommend players with suspected concussion be removed from play and not return prior to medical clearance and a graduated return to play protocol be followed. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Qualitative semi-structured 1:1 interviews with coaches of youth community or school sponsored athletic programs in Illinois. Interview data was analyzed according to a constructivist grounded theory methodology employing constant comparative methods with an inductive approach to theme emergence. <h3>Results</h3> Sixteen coaches of recreational, competitive and scholastic athletic teams participated. Coaches were primarily white (94%) males (81%) with an average age of 47. Ten were volunteer coaches. Analytic themes related to decision making include: 1) personal experience drives decisions more than concussion training, 2) coaches fear the legal liability of missing a concussive event on the field, and 3) discomfort with the ambiguity of making decisions on the field. Coach perceived factors for improving comfort with decision making were: 1) availability of checklists or tools for use on the sidelines, 2) improve shared decision making with all stakeholders, and 3) access to medical professionals on the sidelines. <h3>Conclusions</h3> There is a possible misalignment between coaches' actual practices on the field and best practice guidelines. Coaches report behaviors on the sidelines that are distinct from practice guidelines and public health initiatives related to removal from play and return to play when events on the field present the potential for concussion."
https://openalex.org/W2978444314,Transient perturbation in neuro-ophthalmologic function after repetitive subconcussive head impacts: a randomized controlled trial,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the effect of subconcussive head impacts on neuro-ophthalmologic function tested by the King-Devick test (KDT). <h3>Background</h3> Subconcussive head impacts can lead to insidious neurological impairment if sustained repetitively. The oculomotor system is sensitive to brain trauma; however, neuro-ophthalmologic response to subconcussive head impacts remain unclear. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Sixty-eight healthy adult soccer players with at least 5 years of soccer heading experience were randomized into either a soccer heading group (n = 36) or soccer kicking-control group (n = 32). The independent variables were group (heading vs. kicking control) and assessment time points (pre-, 0 hr-, 2 hr-, and 24 hr-post-heading/kicking). At each time point, KDT performance was assessed. Between the pre and 0hr post time points, heading subjects then performed 10 soccer headers, with the ball traveled at 25 mph, over the course of 10 minutes. The control subjects kicked the soccer ball 10 times. <h3>Results</h3> The heading group experienced a median linear head acceleration of 31.8<i>g</i> per head impact (IQR: 31.1–34.5<i>g</i>) and a median rotational head acceleration of 3.56 krad/sec<sup>2</sup> per head impact (IQR: 2.93–4.04 krad/sec<sup>2</sup>). Conversely, soccer kicks did not result in a detectable level of head acceleration. The kicking control group showed a significant improvement in KDT performance over time, indicating the neuro-ophthalmologic adaptability and learning effect (pre, 42.5 ± 5.7 sec; 0 hr-post, 39.3 ± 5.9 sec; 2 h-post, 38.5 ± 5.8 sec; 24 h-post, 37.3 ± 6.1 sec). However, such improvement was blunted by repetitive soccer headings in the heading group (pre, 43.6 ± 7.8 sec; 0 hr-post, 42.7 ± 7.9 sec; 2 h-post, 42.6 ± 7.8 sec; 24 h-post, 40.7 ± 7.3 sec), as illustrated by significant time × group interactions at 0 hr (<i>p</i> = 0.012) and 2 hr (<i>p</i> = 0.002) post-heading/kicking time points in the mixed-effect regression model. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our data suggest that the neural circuit encompassing the brain and oculomotor system has tremendous abilities to adapt and improve its function if administered repeatedly, but subconcussive head impacts induced by soccer heading can transiently impair neuro-ophthalmologic function and its adaptive property."

The retired athletes and controls were submitted to neurological evaluation, neuropsychological evaluation and EEG. <h3>Results</h3> In general, the soccer players performed well in tests, within the normal range. 15 soccer players had a history of previous TBI/concussion. In the retired group the average age was 60.4 years (55.7 in the CG), average of 11.7 schooling years (13.7 in the CG). The average results in MMSE was 26.6 (29 in the CG), the average digit span in backwards was 3.1 (3.8 in the CG), the average verbal fluency for animals was 15.6 (24 in the CG) and the average clock-drawing test was 8.96 (9 in the CG). Visual EEG analysis showed a predominance of posterior alpha activity between 9.0 and 12.0 Hz (mean 10.3 Hz) in the soccer participants and 11 Hz in the control group (CG). The analysis wiht low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed that 11 soccer players had hippocampal asymmetry (5 had less activity in the right hippocampus and 6 had less activity in the left hippocampus). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Although the performance of the athletes in the tests was within the normal range, the means were always inferior to those of the controls. Almost half of the players presented asymmetry in the analysis by LORETA, although visual EEG analysis was normal. This may indicate that EEG changes may be earlier and more sensitive than clinical changes. These data are preliminary and further analysis are needed."

This includes both the vestibular-ocular and vestibulospinal reflexes which mediate dynamic vision and postural stability. However, few studies have determined if vestibular function is recovered in athletes at the time of RTP from SRC. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Twenty-six NCAA Division-I athletes (1.77 ± 0.14 m, 92.81 ± 31.30 kg, 10 females, 16 males) performed the Concussion Balance Test (COBALT), the Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT), and Gaze Stability Test (GST). Thirteen athletes were tested within 14 days of RTP following SRC. Thirteen athletes with no history of SRC were matched to the RTP group based on age, sex, and sport to serve as healthy controls (HC). Paired t-tests with corresponding effect sizes compared COBALT, DVAT, and GST scores between groups (SRC, HC). For all tests, the alpha level was set a priori at 0.10. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-six NCAA Division-I athletes (1.77 ± 0.14 m, 92.81 ± 31.30 kg, 10 females, 16 males) performed the Concussion Balance Test (COBALT), the Dynamic Visual Acuity Test (DVAT), and Gaze Stability Test (GST). Thirteen athletes were tested within 14 days of RTP following SRC. Thirteen athletes with no history of SRC were matched to the RTP group based on age, sex, and sport to serve as healthy controls (HC). Paired t-tests with corresponding effect sizes compared COBALT, DVAT, and GST scores between groups (SRC, HC). For all tests, the alpha level was set a priori at 0.10. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our preliminary findings suggest that collegiate athletes who return to participation from SRC may experience residual deficits in postural control and visual acuity with dynamic head movements that challenge the vestibular system. Therefore, objective measures of vestibular function may be beneficial to ensure postural control and visual acuity are restored at RTP following SRC."
https://openalex.org/W2979028540,A Comparison of Football and Rugby Tackling During Spring Ball,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The study examined the effects tackling style has on forces translated to the brain in football and rugby. <h3>Background</h3> Tackling is linked to concussion due to high or repetitive impact forces. A small number of NFL teams are incorporating the rugby tackle mechanics due to keeping the head out of the way. Rugby style tackle use is increasing in football. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A convenient sample of 30 male football and rugby participants from two universities participated in this observational study. 20 football participants (20 ± 1.61 YO, 71.63 ± 2.71 in, 210.84 ± 45.52 lbs.) had impact sensors placed in the helmet (CUE™ Sports Sensor, Athlete Intelligence, Kirkland, WA) and 10 rugby participants (20.22 ± 3.31 YO, 70.78 ± 2.11 in, 211.78 ± 40.62 lbs.) were fitted with an instrumented mouthguard (VECTOR™ Sports Sensor, Athlete Intelligence, Kirkland, WA) during their respective spring seasons. Participants practiced without intervention. Devices were returned to researchers after activity, and the data was uploaded. Welch's ANOVA with a Games-Howell post-hoc analyzed the data with significance set at 0.05. <h3>Results</h3> Football participants tallied 3921 impacts over the course of 12 practices, compared to 1868 impacts over 9 practices received by rugby participants. Welch's ANOVA determined that there is a difference in the frequency of impacts between football and rugby participants (<i>Welch's F</i> (1, 4119.84) = 29.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Football participants encountered linear impacts at 62.95 ± 36.57g. Rugby participants sustained impacts 20.59 ± 15.79g. The Welch's ANOVA determined a difference in impact force between the football and rugby participants exists (<i>Welch's F</i> (1, 5741.884) = 3780.385, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Impact frequency appears to be lower in rugby athletes than football athletes during spring ball. Also, the average impact force appears to be less in rugby athletes. The use of a rugby-style tackle generated lower impact forces in athletes when contact occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2979067133,The association between a history of self-reported concussion and response inhibition: a population-based study,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> We investigated the long-term cognitive effects of concussion in almost 20,000 members of the general population, using tests that are known to be sensitive to small changes in performance. <h3>Background</h3> Concussions are the most common type of mild traumatic brain injury, with clinical symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea, persisting for months post-injury. Despite a growing understanding of the severity and duration of these symptoms, very little is known about the long-term effects of concussion on higher level cognitive functioning and emotional lability. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We asked 19,261 participants to complete a demographic questionnaire as well as the Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS) cognitive battery. We divided our sample into two groups: those reporting at least one concussion in their lifetime (post-concussion) and those reporting no concussions in their lifetime (non-concussed). We compared the performance of the two groups on the 12 CBS tasks, as well as on four non-cognitive variables measuring levels of social contact, anxiety, depression, and concentration difficulties. <h3>Results</h3> We found that post-concussion individuals performed significantly worse on a modified Stroop task that measures aspects of response inhibition, but were no worse on any other cognitive measure, including short-term memory, reasoning, and verbal abilities. Crucially, performance profiles of the post-concussion individuals indicated that they made more errors on trials that involved an incongruent colour/word pair. Beyond measures of cognition, we found that post-concussion participants also reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and trouble concentrating when compared to the non-concussed group. The number of reported concussions also predicted task scores on this task only. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results suggest that sustaining a concussion is not associated with long-term global effects on cognition. Those who report at least one concussion appear to have a modest, but statistically significant deficit of response inhibition. This impairment seems to be related to the number of concussions reported."
https://openalex.org/W2977386427,Influence of Learning Disabilities on the Neurophysiological and Neuropsychological Health in Athletes with a History of Concussion,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The aim of present study was to investigate the role of LD on neuropsychiatric and neurophysiological recovery following concussion. <h3>Background</h3> It is estimated that roughly 20% of athletes suffer from a neurodevelopmental disorder (ND). Although concussion research has primarily focused on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the influence of other NDS, such as learning disorder (LD) on concussion outcomes remains relatively unknown. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Seventy-five athletes (24 healthy control, 24 concussed, and 27 concussed-LD) completed a neuropsychiatric and neurophysiological test battery; including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), profile of mood states (POMS), and modified CogState Brain Injury Test battery. Additionally, event-related potentials were recorded during an experimental odd ball task. All athletes were matched based on age, education, BMI, and sport played. Athletes with a history of concussion were further matched on time since injury and number of previous injuries. <h3>Results</h3> Concussion-LD athletes reported significantly greater depressive symptoms compared to matched concussed and healthy control athletes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). When decomposed, the group differences in depressive symptoms were driven by cognitive and affective depression sub-scales (<i>p's</i> &lt; 0.05), not somatic depression (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Additionally, concussion-LD athletes demonstrated greater cognitive deficits characterized by increased learning errors and decreased working memory (<i>p's</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, neurophysiological analyses revealed that Concussed-LD athletes exhibited significantly delayed P3b latency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Finally, irrespective of LD status, athletes with a history of concussion reported increased overall mood disturbances, as well as ratings of anger and hostility compared to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results suggest that athletes with concussed athletes with LD may exhibit chronic neuropsychiatric and neurophysiological deficits beyond that of their concussed counterparts (without LD). Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between LD and concussion outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2977427681,Multidisciplinary Therapy for Persistent Post-Concussion Symptoms: A Case Series from the UCLA Steve Tisch BrainSPORT Clinic,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the effectiveness of a six-session multidisciplinary intervention of coordinated cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and programmed aerobic exercise for patients suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) as measured via a battery of validated patient-reported assessments. <h3>Background</h3> Between 10–30% of patients who suffer a concussion continue to experience elevated symptoms for a period lasting three months or longer post-injury. PPCS presentations are heterogeneous with respect to symptom domain, and while there are currently no clear evidence-based guidelines for treatment, emerging evidence suggests that multidisciplinary care incorporating medical management of symptoms, CBT, and aerobic exercise may be more effective than medical management alone. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Patients in this case series (n = 7, female = 6, age = 26.9 ± 13.0) were referred to therapy from a concussion outpatient clinic. Patients completed a course of CBT and programmed aerobic exercise comprising six in-person sessions and prescribed CBT and aerobic exercise homework to be completed between sessions. Adherence was tracked and outcomes were measured via change in self-reported scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Pediatric/Adult Quality of Life (PedsQL), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI). <h3>Results</h3> All patients completed a full course of therapy and prescribed homework. Significance was defined as <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. Patients showed significant improvement in PSCI total score (<i>p</i> = 0.026; d = −1.115) and improvement trending toward significance in BDI-II (<i>p</i> = 0.075; d = −0.842), PCS (<i>p</i> = 0.087; d = −0.484), and PedsQL (<i>p</i> = 0.089, d = 0.593). <h3>Conclusions</h3> A relatively short multidisciplinary intervention may alleviate symptom burden and improve quality of life in PPCS patients and deserves more systematic study."

In particular, emerging evidence points to anomalies in autonomic functioning as a key player in PPCS. Autonomic functioning is best measured under conditions of stress; however, there are no current studies that examine autonomic functioning in response to cognitive/emotional stressors in youth with PPCS. Therefore, the present study sought to examine the autonomic response to a cognitive/emotional stressor as measured by a cardiorespiratory outcome (end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> fraction [ETCO<sub>2</sub>]) as well as cognitive performance metrics in youth with PPCS. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Participants included 7 patients diagnosed with concussion and 7 non-injured controls between the ages of 13–25. Participants were administered a modified version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), a neuropsychological task that is known to induce autonomic arousal. ETCO<sub>2</sub> data were collected via continuous capnometry recording throughout the task and for 10 minutes after. <h3>Results</h3> After the PASAT, PPCS patients' ETCO<sub>2</sub> concentration remained stable over the 10' post-stress period compared to controls who demonstrated a significant increase in ETCO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) after the cognitive/emotional stressor. In general, patients with PPCS performed more poorly on the middle trials of the PASAT compared to controls but comparisons were not significant. <h3>Conclusions</h3> PPCS patients demonstrate abnormal cardiorespiratory functioning following a cognitive/emotional stressor in that their ETCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations remain chronically low after stress. Results suggest autonomic dysregulation is a promising avenue for future research into the etiology of PPCS."

We analyzed time-synchronized video and data collected during n = 445 player-games of American football resulting in 2851video-verified impacts. Cases where a player sustained impacts and on video was demonstrably witnessed to meet the NFL's ""No-go"" criteria were analyzed in-depth. <h3>Background</h3> In 2011, after reviewing scalar on-field kinematics data leading concussion clinicians concluded <i>""Recent studies suggest that a concussive injury threshold is elusive, and may, in fact, be irrelevant when predicting the clinical outcome</i>"".<sup>1</sup> It is likely that higher fidelity estimates of spatial and temporal impact parameters will clarify the currently unclear impact dose-response relationship. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A total of 2851 video-verified head impacts were identified from 445 player-games. Each event was time-synchronized to video. Any events collected when the athlete was not being impacted in the head were discarded. The remaining true positive events were scrutinized based on published methods to confirm a head impact occurred in the video and the computed motion was physically realistic and matched the video. <h3>Results</h3> We found a median of 5 video-verified head impacts per player-game, which is far fewer than published studies without video verification.<sup>11</sup> For the four players with ""No-go"" impacts, all were to the side/rear. Coronal plane impact sensitivity has been a hypothesized clinical injury mechanism<sup>12</sup> and our results support that hypothesis. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We did not see high PLA/PAA impacts without obvious player ""No-go"" observations. This finding disagrees with other studies that have reported high PLA/PAA impacts without any demonstrable ""No-go"" observations<sup>13</sup>. High energy impacts to the side and rear of the head are more damaging than similar magnitude impacts to the forehead. Armed with this knowledge, clinicians should have more fidelity in their understanding of real-time impact location and severity, and how it relates to athlete concussion risk."
https://openalex.org/W2977636807,Regaining memory after a second hit and other misconceptions about concussion in college athletes and non-athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To understand misconceptions aout concussion in college athletes and non-athletes. <h3>Background</h3> Formal education in concussion appears to be limited to individuals who participate in organized sports at the NCAA level. Overall, there is limitedresearch comparing athletes and non-athletes. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A minimally modified version of the ROCKAS-ST and modified demographics/symptom knowledge questions were administered to 312 college students during the 2018-19 academic year. Participants included college athletes, individuals who participated in high school sports, and individuals with no formal athletic experience. <h3>Results</h3> Current collegiate athletes demonstrated better knowledge than non-athletes, F(2,308) = 3.17, <i>p</i> = .043, but the difference was only 1 question out of 21 and the effect size was small. Misconceptions were evident across groups and included believing that a second injury allows the individual to remember information forgotten as a result of the first concussion (30.1%) and that a concussion can cause an individual to forget who they are and not recognize others but be healthy in every other way (63%). While 97% recognized headache as a symptom of concussion there were also misunderstandings such as 28% of participants identifying breathing problems as a central symptom of concussion. In identifying which demographic factors other than collegiate athletics were related to improved knowledge, individuals who experienced a concussion demonstrated better knowledge (<i>t(309)</i> = −2.165, <i>p</i> = 0.04) as did participants who received education from multiple sources (F(1,309) = 4.712, <i>p</i> = .03, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.015). <h3>Conclusions</h3> While collegiate athletes demonstrate better concussion knowledge than college students who have never been athletes, there continues to be much work to be done. Misconceptions abound and it appears that other than sustaining a concussion, having more sources of education may result in better knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2977661952,Data from an emerging UK sports concussion clinic; should athlete assessment be sports-specific?,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To provide an overview of the Cambridge Sports Concussion Clinic; to investigate trends in patients' neurocognition utilising assessment with the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) as stratified by sport. <h3>Background</h3> Professional sporting litigation in the USA has brought to the fore the issue of sports concussion. Despite this, UK outpatient management remains in its infancy, with less than five centres offering specialised post-injury review. This poster presents data from the Cambridge Sports Concussion Clinic (CSCC), comparing ImPACT assessments across motorsport and rugby. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> The data is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database cohort, in which demographic, clinical and neurocognitive data are archived. The submission includes CSCC patients who attended Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge for clinical review June 2017-March 2019, who were diagnosed with concussion and completed an ImPACT assessment. <h3>Results</h3> 36 post-injury reviews were completed across 19 clinical encounters with patients aged 15yrs+. 47% of athletes were injured during motorsport (saloon car, rally, motocross and single seater racing), 47% in rugby and 5% during equestrian activity. The majority were professional (47%) or competed in collegiate (21%) or high school (21%) competition with 1–13 years at their current sporting level (mean4.2 +/−SD 4.2 years). Only 22% of 18 patients were concussion-naïve prior to their current injury, with a range of 0–4 physician-confirmed diagnoses (1.7 +/− 1.3). Comparison of motorsport drivers versus rugby athletes reveals trends towards lower scores in ImPACT memory composite values (verbal F 0.57, t −1.4, <i>p</i> 0.15; memory F 2.1, t −0.9, <i>p</i> 0.37) and improved reaction time (F 3.3, t 1.8, <i>p</i> 0.08) with significant differences in visual motor speed (F 0.90, t−4.1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Preliminary cross-sport analyses indicate that motorsport competitors have worse composite memory scores, better reaction times and significantly altered visual motor speed. These early data provide support for sports-specific approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2977687107,Concussion prevention strategies: A Survey of division I and division II female soccer teams,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this study is to evaluate concussion prevention strategies being used in NCAA Division I and Division II women9s soccer and characterize the beliefs of Certified Athletic Trainers (ATs) on concussion prevention methods. <h3>Background</h3> While much attention has been paid to decreasing concussion rates in collegiate woman9s soccer, it is unknown what prevention strategies are currently being performed. Additionally, ATs' beliefs on the efficacy of concussion prevention practices for these athletes is unknown. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Participants included ATs employed at any of the 334 Division I or 273 Division II universities working with woman9s soccer. A survey instrument of structured questions followed by open-ended follow up questions was developed to identify if teams utilized cervical strengthening programs, headgear, or other techniques for concussion prevention. Questions also address ATs9 beliefs on the effectiveness of cervical strengthening, headgear and mouthguards in concussion prevention. Data were collected via questionnaire e-mailed through Qualtrics survey software. Responses were received from 222 ATs (37.8% response rate). Data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. <h3>Results</h3> Some form of cervical strengthening or stability for concussion prevention was performed by 38 teams (17.12%) and seven (3.15%) were unsure. The majority (69.86%) believe such programs will aid in concussion prevention. Equipment for concussion prevention was report by 36 (16.59%). Text responses included mouthpieces (n = 3) and headgear (n = 31). Seventy-eight (35.49%) reported players on their team wear headgear. Nineteen (8.76%) believe headgear prevents concussions. Forty-five (20.74%) believe mouthguards prevent concussions. Proper soccer technique is implemented by 151 (69.59%) and 14 (0.06%) cite nutritional strategies for concussion prevention. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Although most ATs believe that cervical strengthening aids concussion prevention, few programs are implementing this strategy. Disconnect exists between available evidence and the perceptions held by ATs regarding mouthguards and headgear for concussion prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2977696374,Predictors of Post-Concussion Depressive Symptoms in Patients without an Underlying Mood Disorder,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To identify predictors of post-concussion depressive symptoms (PCDS) in patients without baseline depressive symptoms. <h3>Background</h3> Depression is common after concussion and affects quality of life and recovery. To date, the most reliable predictor for development of PCDS is existence of an underlying mood disorder. However, few predictors for PCDS in patients without an underlying mood disorder have been found. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A systematic search was conducted using PubMed for all original articles on post-concussion syndrome in subjects older than 18 years and depression published up to May 2, 2019. Studies that described baseline characteristics for those with and without post-concussion depression were included. Two independent authors reviewed all titles/abstracts to identify studies that met selection criteria. Studies describing pediatric presentation were excluded. <h3>Results</h3> Post-concussion depressive symptoms appear to be associated with symptoms of the concussion itself and with increased number of symptoms reported. Repeat concussions may also increase the risk of developing depressive symptoms. In those with persistent post-concussive symptoms, symptoms seem to appear in a predictable sequence, such that symptoms later in the sequence are more likely to be present if symptoms earlier in the sequence were already present. As such, patients reporting persistent depressive symptoms were more likely to also report existence of correlated cognitive (difficulty concentrating or remembering, feeling dazed) and somatic (headache, fatigue, sensitivity to noise and/or light) symptoms that appear earlier in sequence (OR 2.2). No association between age and gender and experience of new-onset depressive symptoms following concussion was found. <h3>Conclusions</h3> In patients without underlying depressive symptoms, predictors such as quantity and characterization of post-concussive symptoms may help elucidate patient profiles vulnerable to development of PCDS. Multiple concussions, presence of multiple post-concussive symptoms, and presence of correlated symptoms appear to be predictive. Familiarization with these predictors may lead to earlier detection and optimal treatment of PCDS."
https://openalex.org/W2977701968,Correlations between qEEG volumetric analysis and computerized cognitive testing shortly after sport concussion injury in high school athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate correlations between sLORETA quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) analysis and a computerized symptom and neurocognitive performance assessment. <h3>Background</h3> We previously reported results of sLORETA qEEG deregulation in recently concussed high school athletes. Correlations between this deregulation and concussion symptoms and neurocognitive performance have not been described in this population. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> EEGs were analyzed in 61 high school athletes shortly after concussion injury using sLORETA imaging compared to a normative database (NYU/BrainDx). Concussion related symptoms and neurocognitive performance were assessed (XLNTbrain). Peak Z-score variation (PZV), and %volume of grey matter activity falling outside Z = −2.5 to 2.5 were calculated for 5 EEG frequency bands. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the qEEG findings and the cognitive performance testing. Statistical comparisons were made between athletes endorsing high symptom scores vs. low scores. <h3>Results</h3> Statistically significant positive correlations were observed between performance on verbal go/nogo, emotional recognition of happy and angry faces and volume and severity of sLORETA deregulation suggesting a pathological relationship. This deregulation consisted primarily of deficient activity in the delta, theta, beta, and beta-gamma bands. Significant negative correlations were observed between performance on nonverbal go/nogo, emotional recognition of angry faces, motor tapping, sentence completion, facial recognition, and word recognition and volume and severity of sLORETA deregulation suggesting compensatory mechanisms. This deregulation consisted primarily of excess activity in the alpha and theta bands. Elevated scores for migraine, worry, and mood were associated with increased severity and volume of increased activity in the beta and beta-gamma bands. Athletes with elevated vestibular symptoms had lower theta band deregulation. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study demonstrates correlations between performance on computerized neurocognitive tasks and changes in sLORETA qEEG analysis shortly after concussion injury in high school athletes. The data suggest some of these changes are pathological, while others are compensatory."
https://openalex.org/W2977776994,The utility of Matrix Reasoning as an embedded performance validity indicatory in youth athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The present study assessed Matrix Reasoning (MR) as an embedded validity indicator (EVI) in youth athletes vulnerable to sport-related concussion, using performance on the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) to operationalize effort. <h3>Background</h3> Matrices tasks have been examined as EVI for pediatric neropsychological assessment (NA; McKinsey, Prieler, &amp; Raven, 2003), and recent literature suggests a cutoff T-score of 43 for MR in the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II) may demonstrate utility within youth athletes completing baseline NA. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> 103 youth athletes (76% male, M<sub>age</sub> = 12.14) completed a NA, including MR (cutoff T = 43) and TOMM (cut-offs = 45 and 49). Sensitivity and specificity for MR were calclated. Reciever operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis determined whether MR performance accurately categorized participants9 effort (represented by TOMM performance). <h3>Results</h3> MR (cut-off T = 43; Sussman et al., 2019) produced sensitivity of 9.09% and specificity of 91.36% in predicting TOMM Trial 1 performance (TOMM1; AUC = 0.449) and 0.00% and 91.18% in predicting TOMM Trial 2 (TOMM2; AUC = 0.074). As a TOMM2 cut-off of 49 offers greater sensitivity to inadequate effort, a further analysis showed MR yielded sensitivity of 0.00% and specificity of 91.00% (AUC = 0.330) in predicting TOMM2 performance with the more conservative cutoff. <h3>Conclusions</h3> MR is an adequate EVI in predicting sufficient effort on TOMM, detecting true effortful performance; however, it was inadequate in detecting true non-effortful performance. A more stringent TOMMM cutoff did not improve sensitivity; thus, MR exhibited poor detection of inadequate effort. Overall, MR has utility as an EVI to support adequate effort in youth athlete populations but should not be used independently. This finding is clinically important because adequate effort at baseline is imperative in determining recovery from concussion."
https://openalex.org/W2977786462,Male Sex Predicts Higher Depression Scores Among Healthy Collegiate Athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To 1) investigate differences in baseline scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) between male and female athletes and 2) examine the influence of concussion history on baseline HADS scores. <h3>Background</h3> Although post-concussion differences between sexes have been documented, whether male and female athletes differ in reporting mental health outcomes and how concussion history may influence scores remains to be fully investigated. Since athletes may experience anxiety and depression after a concussion, screening prior to the beginning of an athletic season (baseline) may identify those who are prone to post-concussion mental health disturbances. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> One hundred fifty-two collegiate athletes (86 males, 66 females) completed a HADS assessment during baseline testing. Each participant also reported the number of diagnosed concussions he or she previously sustained. We used independent samples t-tests to compare baseline HADS scores between male and female athletes, and a multiple linear regression to examine the relationship between baseline HADS scores, sex, and concussion history. <h3>Results</h3> Female athletes reported significantly lower HADS depression scores at baseline compared to males (Females: 0.92 ± 1.49, Males: 1.77 ± 2.22, F = 2.78, <i>p</i> = 0.01). There were no significant sex differences in HADS anxiety scores (Females: 4.53 ± 2.80, Males: 4.51 ± 2.84, F = 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.97), but both sexes had higher anxiety outcomes than depression. There was an independent association between higher HADS depression scores and male sex (β = −0.84, <i>p</i> = 0.01; 95% CI = −1.47, −0.21), but not concussion history (β = −0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.66, 95% CI = −0.51, 0.33). Neither sex nor concussion history were significantly associated with HADS anxiety scores. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Female athletes reported lower levels of depression at baseline than males. Concussion history did not appear to influence anxiety or depression baseline scores. Psychological measures could be evaluated, both at baseline and prior to post-concussion return to play, to help identify those who may need more focused monitoring of mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2977796619,EEG Markers of Cognitive Engagement,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this study was to use portable electroencephalography and qualitative assessments to characterize cognitive changes associated with perceived increase in mental load and to identify markers of mental fatigue in these individuals. <h3>Background</h3> The ability to focus on cognitive tasks impacts everything from our social interactions to our success in the classroom or workplace. Concussion negatively impacts the ability to focus and causes patients to experience signs of mental fatigue more quickly than those without concussion. The mechanisms behind these changes are still not well understood. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Fifteen concussion patients and fifteen age-matched controls were recruited to participate in this study. Participants performed two, thirty-minute testing sessions spaced 1 month apart. In each session, participants performed 8 cognitive tasks eliciting varying levels of cognitive activity. Cognitive activity was quantitatively assessed using a MUSE non-invasive EEG headset. These data were compared to a perceived level of cognitive activity determined by the individual using the Klepsh et al (2017) cognitive engagement scale and mental fatigue assessed by the Mental Fatigue Scale (Johansson2014). <h3>Results</h3> The results demonstrate that frequency based EEG changes correlated with decreased ability to focus on the cognitive task and with perceived cognitive fatigue in both concussion patients and healthy controls. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Future studies should utilize the same methods to monitor cognitive activity differences during daily functional living."
https://openalex.org/W2977806503,Association between Autonomic Nervous System Function and Outcome Following Pediatric Concussion,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the association between heart rate variability (HRV) and pediatric concussion outcomes. We hypothesized that HRV would be related to both clinical symptoms and cognition and that HRV parameters at 2-weeks post-injury would predict outcomes at 5 weeks. <h3>Background</h3> Despite the growing prevalence of concussion among children, research focusing on an objective measure of recovery is lacking. Evidence suggests that dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system may be present following concussion. HRV, an objective measure of autonomic function, could prognosticate persistent symptoms following pediatric concussion. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Forty-five concussed children were evaluated 2 weeks and 5 weeks post-injury. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). Cognition was assessed using a modified CogState Brain Injury Test Battery. Time-domain (SDNN, RMSSD, NN50) and frequency-domain (log-transformed values of low- and high-frequency power) variables of HRV were measured during a resting 5-minute recording. Key demographic and injury characteristics, as well as mean heart rate were factored as covariates. <h3>Results</h3> At 2 weeks post-injury, low-frequency measures showed a positive association with overall RPQ symptoms and Groton Maze Learning and Recall errors (<i>p's</i> &lt; 0.05). At 5 weeks post-injury, NN50 and low-frequency measures showed a positive association with Groton Maze Learning errors (<i>p's</i> &lt; 0.05). At both timepoints, time-domain and high-frequency measures showed a negative association with One-Back task accuracy (<i>p's</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, time-domain and high-frequency measures at 2 weeks post-injury predicted One-Back task accuracy at 5 weeks post-injury (<i>p's</i> &lt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our findings support our hypothesis and indicate that HRV is associated with clinical symptoms and cognitive function post-injury. Importantly, our results also suggest that metrics of HRV collected in the acute phase may serve as a prognostic tool. Additional longitudinal research is warranted in order to replicate the current findings."
https://openalex.org/W2977907781,Concussion and Court: The Role Litigation Plays in Time to Recovery,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate whether there is a difference in time to recovery (TTR) between concussion patients who have and have not pursued litigation post injury, and determine what factors might influence someone's decision to litigate. <h3>Background</h3> An investigation on how litigation influenced TTR in all types of recovery. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A retrospective study of 851 adult and pediatric patients, ages 1–78 (333men and 518 women) in a concussion clinic. Injuries included, motor vehicle accidents MVA (n = 181), falls (n = 140), assaults (n = 36), sporting injuries (n = 378) and other (n = 116). Full and matched samples were studied by symptom endorsement, (headache, dizziness, sleep disturbance, attention/concentration dysfunction and moodiness), litigation/non-litigation and TTR (survival-curve). Secondary analysis reviewed abuse/depression, mechanism-of-injury and symptom type as it related to litigation/non-litigation. <h3>Results</h3> 1) The odds ratio (OR) in the logistic regression model for the unmatched sample shows increasing age, fewer total symptoms (&lt;3 symptoms vs. ≥3), history of abuse/depression, and mechanism-of-injury as significant predictors of litigation status. MVA, compared to sports/other injuries, showed the greatest rates of litigation (OR = 98.121). Higher total symptoms showed increased litigation (OR = 0.238), where abuse/depression patients are less likely to pursue litigation (OR = 0.063/OR = 0.214). 2) A survival analysis of unmatched patients suggested that patients engaging in litigation have a longer TTR (Litigation TTR M = 293 days vs. non-litigation TTR M = 130 days). However, a matched analysis, which grouped patients by age, #of symptoms, abuse/depression history, and mechanism-of-injury, showed no significant difference in survival time between patients based on litigation status. (Litigation TTR M = 269 days vs. non-litigation TTR M = 223 days). <h3>Conclusions</h3> While litigation patients are often stereotyped to malinger and exaggerate symptoms, this data showed that with appropriate matched analysis, there was no difference between litigation/non-litigation patients with TTR. The desire to pursue litigation may be influenced by several factors; athletes were less likely to litigate. These findings are important for physicians and attorneys to consider when tasked with focusing on recovery time in litigation cases."
https://openalex.org/W2977946427,Preliminary Concussion and Lower Extremity Injury Risk Among R.O.T.C. Cadets,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the association between concussions and lower extremity musculoskeletal injury (LE-MSI) rates in Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets. <h3>Background</h3> Concussions have been associated with an increased risk for LE-MSI among high school, collegiate, and professional athletes as well as U.S. Army Soldiers. However, there is a paucity evidence on this relationship among U.S. Army ROTC cadets, future U.S. Army Officers, and a group similar to student-athletes in regards to physical activity levels. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A modified reliable injury questionnaire (ICC = 0.92) was used to identify the total number of reported concussions, intentionally unreported concussions, and potentially unrecognized concussions (e.g., memory loss not diagnosed as a concussion) as well as LE-MSI (e.g., muscle strains, ACL rupture) a cadet had suffered. A chi-square analysis was performed to identify the association between concussion and LE-MSI and any concussive injury and LE-MSI. <h3>Results</h3> 47 cadets (19.9 ± 1.3 years) were recruited from one Army ROTC program. There was not a significant association between reported concussions and LE-MSI (Χ(1) = 3.122, <i>p</i> = 0.077). There was not a significant association between any concussive injury (reported, unreported, or potentially unrecognized) and LE-MSI (Χ(1) = 3.590, <i>p</i> = 0.058). The reported concussion history was 38.3% (18/47), any concussive history was 46.8% (22/47), and 68.1% (32/47) reported history of LE-MSI. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Preliminary results showed that there was no statistically significant association between concussion and LE-MSI among ROTC cadets at this university. Future research is warranted on a larger cohort of cadets to determine if this relationship exists since cadets will soon commission, potentially risking injury while serving on active duty, causing limited duty days, reduced Department of Defense readiness, and increased healthcare costs. Cadets showed a high incidence of concussion and LE-MSK injury, and future research should target reducing these injuries among ROTC cadets prior to commissioning."
https://openalex.org/W2978017534,The Relationship between Headache Severity and Convergence Insufficiency in a Post-Concussive Population,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the relationship between self-reported post concussion headache severity and convergence insufficiency (CI) a common binocular vision deficit, in a clinical post-concussive population. <h3>Background</h3> Both headache and CI are common sequelae of concussion that have been associated with prolonged recovery. Independent of head injury, CI is a known predictor of headache pain [1]. However, the relationship between CI and headache in a post-concussion population is less clear. This is an important relationship to explore since headaches are one of the most common and debilitating post-concussive symptoms. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Retrospective databank analysis was conducted of 174 participants between the ages of 13–84 (<i>M</i> = 37 <i>SD</i> = 19) recruited from an interdisciplinary concussion clinic (<i>M</i> = 295 <i>SD =</i> 609 days post-injury). Near point convergence (NPC) and subjective headache severity were obtained by a neurologist during routine clinical visits. Near point convergence was dichotomized: &gt;5 cm being CI, and &lt;5 ""normal."" Current headache severity was measured using a self-report pain severity scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (most severe). Spearman rank-order correlation was used in order to elucidate the relationship between headache severity and CI. <h3>Results</h3> Results suggest only a weak relationship between post-concussion headache severity and NPC status that failed to reach statistical significance (<i>r</i> = 0.171, <i>p</i> = 0.098). NPC status explained only 3% of the variance in headache severity. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The results of this study suggest that headache and NPC measurements following concussion are very weakly associated. Given the episodic nature of headaches, it may be that statistically significant correlations are not evident unless there is a certain headache severity at time of NPC measurement. Future studies are needed in order to determine whether and to what extent injury severity or patient demographic characteristics mediate this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2978017900,The Effect of Repetitive Head Impact in Sensory Reweighting in Collision College Athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To compare sensory reweighting for upright stance between collegiate collision and non-contact sport athletes. <h3>Background</h3> The potentially adverse effects of repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure through routine collision sport participation have become a major public health concerns. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Thirty male collegiate athletes were grouped by sport type, including collision (n = 15, 21.2 ± 2 years, 85.9 ± 13.8 kg, 179.7 ± 8.2 cm) and non-contact (n = 15, 20.8 ± 2.1 years, 72.9 ± 4.8 kg, 178.3 ± 4.3 cm) sport athletes. Participants underwent a standing balance assessment; they experienced simultaneous perturbations to visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems. The visual stimulus consisted of 500 pyramids displayed on a virtual reality cave and translated in the anterior-posterior direction at 0.2 Hz in a sinusoidal waveform. The vestibular stimulus consisted of binaural-monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) at 0.36 Hz in a sinusoidal waveform. The somatosensory stimulus consisted of bilateral Achilles' tendon vibration at 0.28 Hz in a square waveform with equal on/off times. Different frequencies were chosen for each modality so that we could calculate the gain to each stimulus independently. There were four conditions: two conditions of each high amplitude (0.2 m) and low amplitude (0.8 m) visual scene translation and two conditions of each vibration on and vibration off. The leg segment gain to each modality was compared between groups and across conditions using a repeated-measures ANOVA. <h3>Results</h3> There were no changes in leg segment gain to vision (i.e. group effect; F = 2.624, <i>p</i> = 0.094, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.086), gain to GVS (F = 1.341, <i>p</i> = 0.266, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.46), or gain to vibration (F = 3.124, <i>p</i> = 0.088, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.100). In addition, there were no changes in sensory reweighting for any modality (i.e. condition X group effect; vision, F = 0.074, <i>p</i> = 0.788, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.003; GVS, F = 0.547, <i>p</i> = 0.46, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.019; vibration, F = 0.734, <i>p</i> = 0.399, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.026). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our findings suggest that there are no differences in sensory reweighting between collegiate collision and non-contact sport athletes. Despite concerns that RHI exposure through routine collision sport participation may result in balance disturbances, our results do not support this association."

Indeed, we have previously reported a 1.6 –2.9 times elevated risk of lower extremity injury across a diverse population of collegiate student athletes at the conclusion of their athletic careers. However, there are recent and important calls to investigate the role of gender in concussion research and collegiate female student-athletes have elevated risks of specific injuries. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We recruited 335 student-athletes (62.1% female, mean age, 21.2 ± 1.4 years old) across 13 sports from 17 NCAA member institutions. Participants self-reported concussions under three categories: 1) selfreported concussions, 2) acknowledged unreported concussions (e.g., ""hidden""), 3) unrecognized concussions (e.g., memory loss following a head impact). The lower extremity MSK injuries were self-reported 1) lateral ankle sprains, 2) knee sprains, or 3) lower extremity muscle strain. Chi-square analyses identified the association between each of the concussion variables and lower extremity MSK between self-reported sexes. <h3>Results</h3> For females, there was a significant association between 1) reported concussions and knee injuries (<i>p</i> = 0.018, OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.18 – 4.21), 2) unreported concussions and knee injuries (<i>p</i> = 0.005, OR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.51 – 9.22), 3) unrecognized concussions and lateral ankle sprains (<i>p</i> = 0.007, OR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.32 – 5.15). For males, there was only a significant association between unrecognized concussions and muscle strains (<i>p</i> = 0.020, odds ratio = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.16 – 4.92). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The results of this study suggest females are at higher risk of post-concussion subsequent MSK injury over the course of their collegiate athletic career. Consistent with recent concussion related findings, these results may highlight a gender difference in concussion response and suggests future studies continue to differentiate gender during analysis."

However, their response to repetitive SHI remain unclear. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> In this case-control intervention study, 17 soccer players clinically diagnosed with ADHD who take their prescribed medication daily, were assigned a heading intervention (ADHD-Heading group),individuals who met the ADHD criteria but were non-soccer players, were assigned into a kicking group, (ADHD-Kicking group, n = 15). Whereas 34 soccer players without ADHD diagnosis were randomized into either a heading or kicking intervention, yielding Non-ADHD-Heading group (n = 17) or Non-ADHD-Kicking group (n = 17). To implement SHI, the heading groups executed 10 headers with a standard soccer ball projected at a velocity of 25 mph (equivalent to a long throw-in) over 10 minutes by a JUGS soccer machine, while the kicking groups performed 10 kicks. Neurocognitive function was measured via the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) at pre-intervention baseline, 0h, 2h, and 24h post-intervention. <h3>Results</h3> The vulnerability to SHI was notable in subjects diagnosed with ADHD particularly in memory, as illustrated by a significant group × time interaction, F(6,96) = 3.796, <i>p</i> = 0.002. Both Kicking groups improved verbal memory over time indicating the brain's ability to learn, whereas the Non-ADHD-Heading group showed no improvement. The ADHD-Heading group showed a significant decline at 0h and 2h post-heading compared to other groups. As for visual memory, the ADHD-Heading group showed a significant decline at 24h post; however, all other groups displayed improvement. There were no group differences in remaining domains. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Data suggests neurocognitive vulnerability in athletes diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing SHI, specifically in memory performance. These outcomes can better inform clinicians; overall, promoting a better personalized care in athletes diagnosed with ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W2978118139,ImPACT in UK motorsport; is this the right concussion assessment for our drivers?,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the proportion of learning difficulties in UK motorsport competitors and the effect on ImPACT scores at baseline. <h3>Background</h3> Motorsport competitors have a higher risk of concussion compared to other high-risk sports participants (Deakin et al.). The current worldwide gold standard for management in motorsport is the completion of baseline and post-injury ImPACT, however there has been no formal validation for this population. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively-maintained database cohort, in which demographic and neurocognitive data are archived. The submission includes TOCA competitors aged 14 years and above who completed baseline ImPACT assessments between June 2016-October 2018. <h3>Results</h3> 229 drivers completed baseline ImPACT across three racing seasons in six UK-based championships. Drivers had 0–25 yrs experience at their current level (1.69 +/− 3.0) and the majority were semi-professional (52.4%). 97% of drivers were male and 89% were right-handed. Drivers had completed 8–20+ years of education (12.17 +/− 2.35) at the time of assessment. Almost a fifth had a formal diagnosis of dyslexia (16.6%). When comparing non-diagnosed to dyslexic drivers there was significantly poorer performance on verbal, visual and visual motor composite scores (t3.2, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; t3.6, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; t4.3, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; respectively) and non-significant effect on reaction time (t1.4, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> This motorsport cohort exhibits a higher prevalence of dyslexia than the general population (16.6% vs. 10%), with dyslexic drivers performing significantly worse at baseline on most composite scores. Future post-injury analyses will indicate whether ImPACT is sensitive to the diagnosis of concussion in this unique sporting group."
https://openalex.org/W2978168973,Association of physiological variables with subconcussive head impacts in high school American football,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationships between subconcussive head impact frequency and magnitude and measures of physical exertion and muscle damage. <h3>Background</h3> Subconcussive head impacts, or impacts that do not present with concussion symptoms, are gaining traction as a major public health concern. However, there is a gap in knowledge about the contribution of physiological variables, such as muscle damage and physical exertion, to neurological measures used to assess subconcussive impact-dependent changes. The unknown contribution of physical exertion and strenuous exercise is often listed as a limitation in field studies of subconcussive head impacts. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Fifteen high school football players wore mouthguards installed with triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes in order to quantify the linear and rotational accelerations of every head impact sustained throughout one season (practices and games). Additionally, serum samples were collected at twelve time points (pre-season, pre- and post-competition for five in-season games, and post-season) and assayed for CK-MM, the skeletal muscle-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase. Subjects wore heart rate monitors during the five games, and heart rate data were used to estimate physical exertion in terms of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). <h3>Results</h3> Mixed-effect regression modeling (MRM) showed significant and positive associations between CK-MM and subconcussive head impact kinematic variables, in addition to a significant and positive association between CK-MM and EPOC. The models were adjusted for cumulative head impact exposures up to each game and the pre-season serum CK-MM levels, when applicable. <h3>Conclusions</h3> When investigating subconcussive head impacts, the effects of muscle damage should be considered when using correlated outcome measures, such as inflammatory biomarkers and vestibular assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2978172187,Repetitive head impact exposure and sensory reweighting for upright stance,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To compare sensory reweighting between soccer players who report higher exposure to soccer heading and those who report lower exposure to soccer heading. <h3>Background</h3> Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI), such as through routine soccer heading, may have potentially detrimental effects. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Thirty participants completed a self-reported questionnaire to estimate the number of RHI sustained weekly, and were divided into low-, medium-, and high-RHI groups based on their responses. Sensory reweighting was compared between low-RHI (N = 10, 4 males, 22.9 ± 3.0 years, 170.5 ± 7.7 cm, 70.0 ± 12.14 kg, 2 ± 2 RHI) and high-RHI groups (N = 10, 5 males, 20.0 ± 1.1 years, 170.4 ± 7.4 cm, 69.6 ± 13.4 kg, 60 ± 37 RHI). Participants experienced a visual stimulus at 0.2 Hz, a ±1 mA binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulus (GVS) at 0.36 Hz, and a vibratory stimulus to their bilateral Achilles tendons at 0.28 Hz during standing. The visual stimulus was presented at different amplitudes (0.2, 0.8 m translation in the anterior-posterior direction) to measure the change in leg gain to vision, gain to vibration, and gain to GVS. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare sensory reweighting between groups. <h3>Results</h3> There were group differences in sensory reweighting for leg gain to GVS (i.e. condition X group effect; F<sub>3,54</sub> = 5.068, <i>p</i> = 0.004, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.220), whereby the high-RHI group did not reweight gain to GVS across conditions, and gain to vision (F<sub>3,54</sub> = 3.397, <i>p</i> = 0.024, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.159), whereby the high-RHI group had higher gains than the low-RHI group in the 0.2 m visual stimulus condition. There were no group differences in sensory reweighting for gain to vibration (F<sub>1,18</sub> = 0.045, <i>p</i> = 0.834, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.003). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Routine soccer heading is associated with relatively high head accelerations. These results suggest that exposure to frequent RHI may induce adaptation that diminishes reliance on vestibular function. Consequently, visual feedback is upweighted to maintain balance during upright stance."
https://openalex.org/W2978258835,Concussion-like symptoms Induced by Heat and Dehydration in a Varsity College Soccer Player: A Case Report,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> Show light on confounding presentations of heat and environmental related illnesses &amp; mild TBI symptomatology. Identify overlapping symptomatology of heat illness &amp; mild TBI. <h3>Background</h3> Heat illnesses, mostly heat exhaustion, tends to go under reported and many times, due to the nature of the activity, may be confused with a concussion despite the individual not experiencing any identifiable concussive event. Heat related illnesses are caused when the body is unable to regulate the cooling of itself. Normal physiological mechanisms such as sweating may not be sufficient to respond to the severe increase and change in temperature. As a result, the body temperature will raise to dangerous levels and cause damage to vital organs, including the brain. Today, there is very limited literature available that compares the symptoms of concussion vs heat illnesses. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Case obtained from a Barrow Neurological Institute Concussion and Brain Injury patient. Case will reported from available history and clinic follow up visit. Overlapping symptoms of heat and concussion will demostrated in table format. No HIPPA information will be disclosed. <h3>Results</h3> The Soccer player was prevented from play due to a ""Concussion"" according to the Athletic trainer. No identifiable event was reported. Patient did experience Migranious headaches that were triggered by dehydration and execisseve heat exposure. <h3>Conclusions</h3> There is a significant overlap in concussion and heat related symptoms. Family history of migraines is a predisposing factor for both concussion and heat illness. Heat illness is noticeable underreported and may be confused as a concussion in high impact /collision activities; which, provides a challenge in itself due to nature of sports and exercise. Education about heat illness is important. More research is require to determine how much these two process overlap in symptomatology, are confounded &amp; misdiagnosed, and occur concomitantly."
https://openalex.org/W2978269695,Does the Concussion Clinican Examination Predict Post-Concussion Subsequent Musculoskeletal Injury?,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To identify post-concussion subsequent lower extermity musculoskeletal injury predictors from a clinical concussion assessment. <h3>Background</h3> Emerging evidence has identified an elevated risk of subsequent lower extremity musculoskeletal injury (LE-MSK) in the year post-concussion. This approximately 2-fold elevated risk has been identified in diverse populations including high school, college, professional sports and military populations. While persistent impairments in postural control are a speculated mechanism, these assessments require instrumented biomechanical measures; thus, there are currently no clinically feasible predictors which have been identified. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Eighty three NCAA Division I student-athletes (51.8% female, ht: 1.75 +/− 0.12 m, wt: 76.2 +/− 20.1 kg) who had suffered a sports related concussion (LOC: 7.5%, PTA: 12.2%) with baseline data were assessed within 72 hours post-concussion were included in this retrospectic study. The clinical examination consisted of the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Clinical Reaction Time (CRT), King-Devick (KD) and the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitve Test (ImPACT) composite values. Change scores (Δ) from baseline to acute post-concussion served as predictors to identify subsequent LE-MSK with a step wise binary logistic regression. <h3>Results</h3> The subsequent LE-MSK rate was 72.3% (60/83). The overall model failed to identify a predictive relationship between change scores and subsequent injury risk (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.242, <i>p</i> = 0.458). Exploratory testing failed to identify any significant individual predictors of subsequent LE-MSK: BESS: Δ = −0.35 errs, <i>p</i> = 0.964; SAC: Δ = −0.55, <i>p</i> = 0.239; ImPACT Verbal Memory: Δ = −0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.324; ImPACT Visual Memory: Δ = −5.6, <i>p</i> = 0.750; ImPACT Motor Speed: Δ = −2.81, <i>p</i> = 0.070; ImPACT Reaction Time: Δ = 0.042 sec, <i>p</i> = 0.164; CRT: Δ = 12.2 ms, <i>p</i> = 0.564; and KD: Δ = 2.8 sec, <i>p</i> = 0.607. <h3>Conclusions</h3> None of the common clinical concussion assessments were a significant predictor of subsequent LE-MSK potentially due to a high injury rate (72.3%). Future research should continue attempts to idenify clinically feasible predictors to allow clinicians to identify at-risk athletes to engage injury prevention strategies to reduce subsequent LE-MSK."
https://openalex.org/W2978348694,Nonverbal hand movement durations indicate post-concussion symptoms of athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> Concussions are common in sports and appear to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and mental health problems. Methods of post-concussion diagnosis are still of debate, regarding sensitivity, objectivity, reliability, and costs. Spontaneous displays of nonverbal hand movement behavior during interaction are indicative of psychopathology and relatively simple to record and analyze. <h3>Background</h3> Increased durations of continuous (/irregular) body-focused hand movement activity in particular indicates psychopathology that overlaps in symptomatology with that of sport related concussions (SRC). We therefore hypothesized that the duration of irregular, on body, and act on each other hand movements is increased in athletes with SRC who suffer from post-concussion symptoms. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Three matched groups were investigated: 14 symptomatic athletes with a concussion, 14 asymptomatic athletes with a concussion, and 12 non-concussed athletes. Four certified raters analyzed with the NEUROGES analysis system all nonverbal hand movements that were displayed during a videotaped standardized anamnesis about concussion history, incidence, course of action, and post-concussion symptoms. <h3>Results</h3> Irregular Structure units of symptomatic athletes are significantly longer when compared to asymptomatic athletes. Hand movement durations of irregular, on body, and act on each other correlate positively with post-concussion symptoms. The duration of irregular units significantly predicts the PCS score. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Increased durations of irregular hand movement units indicate post-concussion symptoms in athletes with sport-related concussions. Because the recording of spontaneous displays of nonverbal hand movement behavior is relatively simple and cost-efficient, we suggest using the neuropsychological analysis of hand movement behavior as a future diagnostic parameter of concussion management protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2978370548,Effects of football practice on blink reflex parameters in Division I football athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The objective was to access the effects of football practice sessions on blink reflex parameters using the Eyestat. <h3>Background</h3> Our laboratory has utilized a potential objective measure to identify concussions. This technology, called Eyestat, is a noninvasive diagnostic tool measuring changes in blink reflex parameters. Prior research cited significant differences in various blink reflex parameters between active play, concussion, and baseline; however, the number of subjects for the active play population was small (N = 10). Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify blink reflex parameters during football practice, providing outcomes potentially helpful with its use for a concussed population. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Forty-seven Division I male football players between the ages of 18-22 were evaluated on multiple sessions during a 2 week period of football practices. During various points of the practice, subjects completed the blink test and had their heart rate assessed. During the blink test, subjects placed their face against the apparatus, which directed a puff of air to the corner of the subject's eye to stimulate the blink. Five puffs were administered in a random fashion over a 20 second period in which videography captured and recorded the blink. <h3>Results</h3> Results of the study found significant differences in latency (<i>p</i> = 0.0000), time under the threshold (<i>p</i> = 0.0176), oscillations (<i>p</i> = 0.0217) and excursion (<i>p</i> = 0.0003), but no significant differences in differential latency (<i>p</i> = 0.0626). Average heart rate was 125 BPM, with a minimum of 72 BPM and maximum of 172 BPM. The results of this study correlate with prior research in latency, time under the threshold and excursions and support the changes in blink reflex parameters after football practice. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Future studies need to assess if changes occur with individual physical activity or is it related only to the practice of this sport."
https://openalex.org/W2978408264,An objective method to assess and recommend exertion and exercise targets for return to play post concussion,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The object of this presentation is to supply the athletic trainer with data concerning a methodology that can be used to aid in designing a cardio conditioning regimen postconcussion as well as an exercise or lifting program postconcussion. This objective measure does not rely on subjective patient reports of symptoms and utilizes a reflex based assessment method. <h3>Background</h3> Sports concussion is a substantial concern for athletic trainers and there is a critical need to objectively and safely allow an athlete to return to play as soon as safely possible. Being able to make cogent recommendations as opposed to empirically trying something that has an intrinsic risk of eliciting symptoms or causing setbacks is urgently needed. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> We present data concerning 65 athletes (mean age 20.8 years) who were assessed. This was done while on an exercise bike going through a progression of exertion levels. The TERC Murmur was listened for every 2 minutes at the traditional carotid artery position. <h3>Results</h3> Results for cardio assessment. 73% of the cardio assessment subjects had a TERC Murmur at a heart rate of 127.2 bpm (± 16 SD). The transient exertion related carotid (TERC) murmur is a murmur that is heard at the carotid arteries during exercise. It normally is heard at around a heart rate of 150, but is heard a lower heart rates in concussion patients. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The clinical advantages of the use of the TERC murmur is that it can be applied by an athletic trainer with the training to listen for a blood pressure. It provides objective information concerning safe heart rates and target heart rate. Being able to safely recommend a means by which an athlete can condition (cardio and or lifting) will accelerate return to play as well as aid in keeping the athlete happy, healthy and engaged."
https://openalex.org/W2978486169,Preliminary Evidence-Based Recommendations for Return to Learn: a novel pilot study tracking concussion recovery in college students,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> Investigate the potential factors influencing resolution of chief concussion symptoms in a longitudinal design. Second, assess subjects' perception of their concussion recovery and what types of activities and accommodations appeared beneficial. <h3>Background</h3> Athletes re-entering the academic setting after a concussion is commonly referred as return-to-learn (RTL), which has appeared secondary to the abundantly researched return-to-play protocols implemented ubiquitously. Importantly, every concussed collegiate, adolescent, and pediatric athlete is first and foremost a student-athlete, with ""student"" holding the emphasis. To date, very few studies have examined the RTL aspect of concussion recovery, and the effects premature classroom attendance may cause. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Nine concussed, college aged (18-26 years), full-time students were monitored longitudinally throughout their recovery from diagnosis to full symptom-free academic participation. Symptom severity for five prevalent symptoms were recorded 4 times per day, along with a daily phone call to report participant's diet, duration of screen-time usage and music listened to, physical activity participation, and types of classes attended. <h3>Results</h3> Response rates to text messages and phone calls yielded a mean 92% and 93% respectively across the nine subjects. Additionally, five variables were significantly associated with symptom resolution (music, sleep, physical activity, water, and time) (<i>p</i> = 0.0004 to <i>p</i> = 0.036). Lastly, subjects reported math and computer-oriented courses as the most difficult (33% and 44% respectively). Additional time on assignments/exams and reducing screen brightness were the most beneficial accommodations (66% and 56% respectively). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our findings introduce a novel and robust approach to monitoring concussed students throughout their recovery. Furthermore, this methodology is the first to produce holistic evidence-based results concerning re-integrating students to the classroom. Lastly, it appears that dietary and social behaviors can indeed influence symptom resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2978524744,Differential Effects of Injury Etiology on Pediatric Concussion Recovery,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the relation between mechanism of injury and pediatric concussion outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals injured during sport (sport related concussions; SRC's) will demonstrate better outcomes than those with non-sport injuries (mild Traumatic Brain Injuries; mTBI's), specifically in terms of clinical symptoms, mental health, cognition, and cardio-autonomic function. <h3>Background</h3> Concussions are a growing health concern; however, little is known how different injury etiologies (sport vs. non-sport) effect recovery. Therefore, it is critical to better understand how different injury etiologies effect recovery from concussion to more efficiently guide clinical practices. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Data collected from a local pediatric concussion clinic were analyzed. SRC and mTBI participants were matched on key demographics (age, body mass index, education) and injury characteristics (time between injury and clinical evaluations, prior history of concussion, pre- and post-injury physical activity). Clinical symptoms were measured using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (R-PCS). Mental health was measured using the Beck Youth Inventory of Depression (BYI-D). Cognition was measured using a modified CogState Brain Injury Test Battery. Cardio-autonomic function was assessed via heart rate variability (HRV). Participants were evaluated during the acute phase of injury, and again in the post-acute phase. <h3>Results</h3> At both time points, adolescents with mTBI reported greater clinical and depressive symptoms than those with an SRC (<i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.05). During the acute phase, adolescents with SRC and mTBI significantly differed on multiple metrics of heart rate variability (<i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.05). There were no group differences in cognition at either time point. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results suggest those incurring a SRC may demonstrate better outcomes than those incurring an mTBI. Future longitudinal research including baseline measurements is necessary to determine the validity of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2978528502,Baseline Cardiorespiratory Function in Youth with Persistent Post-Concussion Symptoms,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate cardiorespiratory functions in youth with persistent post-concussion symptoms compared to controls and to examine the predictive value of relevant demographic and medical variables. <h3>Background</h3> Recent studies propose that persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) (e.g., headache, fatigue, or dizziness; lasting &gt;2 months post injury) may be linked to autonomic dysregulation, initially provoked by injury but then maintained by biopsychosocial factors during recovery (i.e., pain sensitivity, behavioral avoidance of symptom triggers, worries, etc). One way that autonomic dysregulation can be detected is through monitoring cardiorespiratory dynamics such as end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> fraction (ETCO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (PsO<sub>2</sub>) and pulse rate (PR). However, the few studies measuring cardiorespiratory outcomes in concussion are restricted to the acute stage of injury. Therefore, the present study sought to examine 1) cardiorespiratory functioning in youth patients with PPCS and 2) the relationship of relevant demographic and medical variables to these outcomes. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Participants between the ages of 13-25 were recruited into two groups: 1) n = 7 patients diagnosed with concussion and PPCS (2-9 months post-injury) and 2) n = 7 non-injured controls. Data (ETCO<sub>2</sub>, RR, PsO<sub>2</sub>, &amp; PR) were collected using a capnometer during a 5-minute passive recording session. <h3>Results</h3> At rest, patients' ETCO<sub>2</sub> measurements were significantly lower than controls (<i>p</i> = .04) with a large effect size (<i>d</i> = 1.22). Besides injury status, the only significant medical or demographic variable was positive family history of anxiety, which predicted lower ETCO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i> = .04; <i>d</i> = 1.35). Of note, personal history of anxiety disorder was not significantly correlated with ETCO<sub>2</sub>. <h3>Conclusions</h3> PPCS patients appear to have ETCO<sub>2</sub> concentration below the normal range at baseline (i.e., rest), supporting the theory that disrupted autonomic regulation in this population is related to persistent symptoms. Importantly, autonomic dysregulation as measured through cardiorespiratory functioning could represent a promising treatment target for PPCS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2978575926,The efficiency of the King-Devick Test for detecting concussion in a youth athlete population,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> 1) To investigate the efficiency of the King-Devick Test (KDT) as a screening tool for concussion in a pediatric collision-sport population prone to concussion 2) to examine the accuracy of the KDT when administered by trained laypersons. <h3>Background</h3> The KDT is an efficient sideline assessment tool for sport-related concussion (Howitt et al., 2016). KDT has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of concussion, reliable, and easy to use and interpret (Echemendia et al. 2017). There are rarely medical professionals on the sideline of youth events and the KDT has effectively been administered by laypersons in a cohort of amateur boxers (Leong, et al., 2013). <h3>Design/Methods</h3> 32 sideline KDT evaluations (21 possible concussions; 11 controls; 3 excluded due to inability to confirm concussion diagnosis) of 28 collision sport athletes (1 female) aged 7 to 15 were conducted. Sideline KDT time was compared to baseline KDT time to determine pass or fail (&gt;1 second longer = fail). Sensitivity and specificity for KDT were calculated to determine KDT ability to identify concussion. Medical professional identification of concussion = concussion diagnosis. 10 concussions were identified. Further analysis evaluated sensitivity and specificity of KDT based on who conducted sideline evaluation (layperson n = 10). <h3>Results</h3> The overall sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 89.5%. When administered by a layperson, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 80.0%. <h3>Conclusions</h3> In this small study, KDT was helpful for detecting the presence of concussion and correctly identifying individuals without concussion. KDT should be added to sideline concussion screening in a pediatric population prone to concussion. Ideally, medical professionals should be present; however, when administered by laypersons, the KDT yielded excellent sensitivity and adequately identified those without concussion supporting its effective administration by trained laypersons as a practical screening tool."
https://openalex.org/W2978621632,History of Concussion and Nonfatal Suicidal Behaviors in U.S. High School Students: Findings from the 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine the association between concussion history and suicidal behaviors in adolescents from the 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). <h3>Background</h3> Research indicates that behavioral changes such as impulsivity and lack of emotional control are common following youth concussion. Additional evidence suggests that poor behavioral regulation may contribute to altered mood states that precede possible self-injury or fatality. To date, the relation between adolescent concussion and suicidal behaviors has not been explored on a national scale. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Data from 14,765 high school students were cross-sectionally analyzed. Weighted multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of suicidal behaviors in students with and without a history of concussion. Age, sex, and alcohol use were controlled for in the regression model. <h3>Results</h3> Adolscents with history of concussion were at greater odds of reporting suicidal ideation (AOR = 1.39, CI 1.16, 1.65), suicide planning (AOR = 1.34, CI 1.14, 1.57), suicidal attempts (AOR = 1.68, CI 1.36, 2.09), and injurious suicidal attempts (AOR = 2.42, CI 1.82, 3.22). In addition, females with a history of concussion demonstrated greater odds of reporting poor mental health than males with history of concussion (<i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.05). Further, history of concussion among individuals aged 16 years or older was significantly associated with increased suicidal behaviors, whereas this association was not observed in younger adolescents (<i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.05). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our findings indicate that adolescents who sustain a concussion have greater odds of suicidality than their uninjured counterparts. Further, suicidality was better predicted by concussion exposure in females than males, and in older students. Consequently, these results indicate the importance of examining mental health following youth concussion, and highlight the need for further longitudinal research."
https://openalex.org/W2978647344,Relationship between serum-based biomarkers & Magnetic Resonance Imaging measures following mild traumatic brain injury in collegiate athletes post return to play,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> This study analyzed MRI and serum samples from 30 participants across two groups to explore the relationship between protein levels and MRI scans in post return-to-play collegiate athletes following concussion. <h3>Background</h3> Recently, there has been an increase in concussion research on their effects on different protein levels in serum (a derived portion of blood) between concussed and control groups. Recent research examining serum biomarkers in concussion have found elevated levels of many proteins, but overall have mixed results in correlation with MRI. However, these studies have not focused on the lingering effects that exist in post return-to-play. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> The first group (n = 15) consisted of recently cleared to return-to-play collegiate athletes after experiencing a sports-related concussion. The second group (n = 15) was collegiate athlete controls matched on age, sex, and sport. Serum samples were collected to assess the levels of proteins following post return-to-play. These proteins were evaluated using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay kits (ELIASA). <h3>Results</h3> An overall BDNF effect was observed between groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), the concussed group exhibited significantly higher levels of serum BDNF compared to the control group. A positive association between BDNF and gray matter volume (GMV) was observed at a 250 voxel cluster level in both the right (<i>p</i><sub><i>FDR</i></sub> = 0.015) and left cerebellum region (<i>p</i><sub><i>FDR</i></sub> = 0.045) across groups. A negative association between BDNF and GMV in both groups was observed in the brainstem (<i>p</i> = 0.029) and the precuneus (<i>p</i> = 0.017) areas. A differential relationship between group and BDNF on GMV was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.022) in the prefrontal cortex. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Previous research has not examined the post return-to-play effects in neuroplasticity specific proteins, nor the time frame of injury in comparison to controls with MRI. Serum-based biomarkers and MRI grant a better depiction of what is occurring during post return-to-play."

Limited empirical evidence associates soccer heading during early adolescence and long-term behavioral deficits. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Thirty college-aged soccer players self-reported AFE to soccer heading. Sensory reweighting was compared between AFE ≤ 10 [n = 19, 11 males (58%), 22 ± 3 years, 171 ± 9 cm, 70 ± 11 kg, 5 with concussion history (26%)] and AFE &gt; 10 [N = 11, 5 males (45%), 22 ± 2 years, 172 ± 7 cm, 69 ± 13 kg, 3 with concussion history (27%)]. To evaluate sensory reweighting, we simultaneously perturbed upright stance with visual (i.e., moving visual scene at 0.2 Hz), vestibular (i.e., ±1 mA bilateral monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulus (GVS) at 0.36 Hz), and proprioceptive stimulation (i.e., 80 Hz vibratory stimulus to their bilateral Achilles tendons at 0.28 Hz). The visual stimulus was presented at different amplitudes (i.e., 0.2 m, 0.8 m in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction) to measure the leg-segment AP displacement change in gain to vision, an intramodal effect; and change in gain to GVS and vibration, both intermodal effects. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare sensory reweighting between groups. <h3>Results</h3> There were no differences in gain to vision (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.033, <i>p</i> = 0.857, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.001), gain to GVS (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.971, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.000), or gain to vibration (F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.974, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.000), and no differences in sensory reweighting (i.e. conditionXgroup effect; vision, F<sub>3,84</sub> = 0.160, <i>p</i> = 0.923, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.006; GVS, F<sub>3,84</sub> = 0.043, <i>p</i> = 0.988, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.002; vibration, F<sub>1,28</sub> = 0.068, <i>p</i> = 0.797, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.002). <h3>Conclusions</h3> There were no differences in sensory processing for upright stance between AFE ≤ 10 and AFE &gt; 10, suggesting that soccer heading during early adolescence is not associated with balance deficits in college-aged soccer players, notwithstanding potential deficits in other markers of neurological function."
https://openalex.org/W2978721094,Development and Assessment of a Novel Peer Concussion Education Program for College Athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel peer concussion education program designed to increase knowledge of concussions, reporting of concussive events, and attitudes for both teammates and individuals in high concussive sports. <h3>Background</h3> Over 460,000 student-athletes compete in 24 NCAA sports every year. Concussions are estimated to occur between 0.43—0.57 per 1000 athletic events for student-athletes (Covassin, et al., 2016; Daneshvar et al., 2011) but these rates rely in part on self-report, which is likely affected by factors including the culture surrounding athletics (IOM, 2013). The Institute of Medicine, NCAA, Department of Defense, and the CDC have all called for educational interventions to change the culture of competitive athletics pertaining to concussion so that reporting of concussion becomes the norm. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> A multi-site randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Measures of concussion knowledge, knowledge of the return to play protocol, intention to report concussions, direct subjective norms, direct perceived behavioral control, and indirect perceived behavioral control were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at a one-month follow-up with the last four measuring perspectives for both self and teammate. <h3>Results</h3> 1614 male and female student-athletes from 60 teams (30 experimental, 30 control) belonging to 10 colleges/universities across all 3 NCAA Divisions completed the study. Results indicated that student-athletes who participated in the program demonstrated greater increases in concussion knowledge, intention to report concussion, understanding of the return to play protocol, direct subjective norms, direct perceived behavioral control, and indirect perceived behavioral control for both self and teammate compared to controls post-intervention and at the one-month follow-up. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The novel peer-mediated approach to concussion education shows promise in increasing concussion knowledge, intention to report concussion, and for facilitating attitudinal changes that support reporting among student-athletes and in changing the norms of concussion reporting on a team."

However, the influence of concussion history, career status and cumulative years played on total symptoms, symptom severity, neurocognitive function, and balance is largely unexplored. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Elite football players (n = 102; age <i>M</i> = 27.75 ± 6.95 years) without a concussion (&gt;30 days) underwent SCAT-3 assessments. Players were placed into a low (0–1) or multiple concussion (2+) history group and categorized by career status (draft prospects, active professional players and retired professional players). Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression and multiple linear regression analyses. <h3>Results</h3> 58.8% of players reported symptoms. Most common symptoms were fatigue (33.3%), trouble falling asleep (31.4%), difficulty remembering (29.4%), and difficulty concentrating (20.6%). Multiple concussions group reported 3.07 times greater total symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), 3.58 times higher symptom severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and lower SAC scores (1.42 points) (<i>p</i> = 0.033) compared to low concussion group. Professionals reported 1.88 times greater total symptoms (<i>p</i> = .038) and 2.35 times higher symptom severity compared to draft prospects (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Retired players reported 7.07 times greater total symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), 8.97 times higher symptom severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), lower SAC scores (1.98 points) (<i>p</i> = 0.025), and 3.67 more m-BESS errors (<i>p</i> = 0.002), compared to draft prospects. Players with 11–19 years football exposure reported 3.83 times higher symptom severity compared to players with &lt;11 years football exposure (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Players with &gt;19 years football exposure had 6.87 times higher symptom severity than players with &lt;11 years football exposure (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Retired players with multiple concussions and 19+ years of contact football exposure are likely to have more symptoms, higher symptom severity, and lower neurocognitive scores."
https://openalex.org/W2978838869,No Differences in Tandem Gait Performance Between Males and Females Acutely Post-Concussion,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To examine sex differences in TG performance among collegiate student-athletes acutely post-concussion relative to pre-injury performance. <h3>Background</h3> Postural control impairments are common following concussion and traditionally assessed using the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). Tandem gait (TG) has successfully identified impairments in postural control acutely post-concussion that were undetected by the BESS; thus, TG may be a more robust postural control assessment following concussion. While sex differences in BESS performance after concussion have been explored, there is no literature regarding sex differences in post-concussion TG. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Forty-eight concussed collegiate student-athletes (30 females) and twenty-five healthy controls (13 females) completed TG tests during pre-season and again acutely post-concussion. Participants walked heel-to-toe down a 3-meter line, turned, and returned as quickly as possible, completing four single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) TG trials. During DT trials, they simultaneously answered mini-mental style questions. The best ST and DT times were recorded. A 2 × 2 (group*sex) ANOVA was used to examine TG change between pre-injury and post-injury tests (positive value = slower/worsening; negative value = faster/improving). <h3>Results</h3> The change in TG time from pre-injury to post-injury was significantly higher for the concussion group relative to the control group during both ST (Concussion: 1.6 ± 2.6 seconds, Controls: −1.1 ± 0.8 seconds, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and DT (Concussion: 2.0 ± 3.8 seconds, Controls: −0.9 ± 1.7 seconds, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) TG. There were no significant interactions (ST: <i>p</i> = 0.17, DT: <i>p</i> = 0.23) or main effects for sex (ST: <i>p</i> = 0.63, DT: <i>p</i> = 0.91). <h3>Conclusions</h3> There were no sex-specific differences in TG performance acutely post-concussion. However, all concussed participants, regardless of sex, performed significantly worse on TG than male and female controls after injury relative to baseline, while controls did not demonstrate such a change. These results suggest that TG can appropriately identify postural control impairments following concussion; however, there do not appear to be differences in performance between males and females."
https://openalex.org/W2978932622,"Comparison of Symptomology, Symptom Resolution Time, and Return to Play Time between Concussions Sustained in the Same Academic Year",2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The purpose of this study is to examine symptomology, symptom resolution time, and return to play (RTP) time between concussions sustained in the same academic year. <h3>Background</h3> Previous research shows that among those with a history of previous concussions, outcomes for a recurrent concussion are worse, especially when concussions occur within two weeks of each other. Despite this research, there has been little investigation into concussions that occur in the same academic year. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Concussion data was collected from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program (ISP) during the 2009/10-2017/18 academic years. Concussions were reported by athletic trainers (ATs) and were included if the student-athlete sustained two concussions in the same academic year. Proportions and means of symptoms, symptom resolution time, and RTP time were calculated, and, as appropriate, McNemar's tests and Wilcoxon sign-rank tests were used to compare these between the first and second concussions. <h3>Results</h3> Overall, 138 student-athletes sustained 276 concussions across 15 different sports a mean of 43 days apart (SD: 37.3). Fewer symptoms were reported in the second concussion compared to the first (4.3 vs. 5.2, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.01). RTP time was, on average, five days longer for the second concussion (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and a larger proportion of second concussions resulted in participation restriction of ≥30 days (first: 7.3%, second: 26.8%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Symptom resolution time did not differ between the first and second concussions. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Although the RTP time was greater in second concussions compared to first, symptom resolution time did not differ. This suggests that there may be a difference in AT management of second concussions, with a more conservative, extended RTP progression. Further research is needed to examine the association between time between concussions and differences in concussion presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2978954840,Observational Study of Prevention and Intervention Strategies That Help Speed Return to Play Post-Concussion in Division I College Football,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> We present evidence that a neurovisual oriented training program is associated with decreased concussion incidence and faster return to play (RTP) post injury in this observational cohort study. <h3>Background</h3> Sports concussion has been in the public eye and has been associated with heightened fear concerning playing football and other collision based sports. Protecting from concussion and rehabilitating the brain after a concussion is a high priority for many sports medical practitioners as well as for athletes wanting to play. For these reasons researchers associated with the American Athletic Conference (AAC) have been monitoring concussion incidence in football. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> The 12 schools of the AAC were surveyed for 2014, 2015, and 2016 concerning football induced concussions. <h3>Results</h3> The average seasonal concussion rate was 10.4 ± 1.02 concussions per year and average RTP time was 13.2 ± 1.21 days. In the one team where there was an aggressive neuro visual conditioning and rehabilitation post-concussion program employed the concussion rate was 3.0 ± 1.0 concussions per year and the RTP time was 6.5 ± 0.5 days. Both numbers are significantly lower than in the other AAC teams. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The current paper reports that there may be mitigation strategies that can be employed to decrease concussion incidence as well as aid in faster RTP times. Such attempts to make football safer are needed as brain injury has been associated with long term consequences. Improving safety and brain health through mitigation strategies along with rehabilitation methods may aid in keeping athletes safer during play and throughout the lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2978958587,Flying may not affect symptom recovery after concussion in Athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To determine if there is a relationship between concussion recovery and airplane travel soon after injury in collegiate athletes and military cadets. <h3>Background</h3> Concussions are a common occurrence in young athletes. Very few studies have examined how flying may influence the clinical progression of a concussive injury. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> This is a prospective cohort study comprised of 3480 college athletes and cadets with concussion obtained from the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium and divided in two groups: those who flew and those who did not fly after concussion. Those with unknown flight status were excluded. Demographics between groups were compared using Chi Square analysis. Symptom burden was calculated by subtracting baseline Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3) symptom scores from the post-injury score after flying. Significance between outcome measures and flight status were evaluated using a paired t-test. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if number of time zones crossed during flight influenced outcomes. <h3>Results</h3> 165 athletes flew 31.8 ± 52.3 [SD] hours after injury, 2235 athletes did not fly, and 1080 had unknown flight status. There were no significant study group differences for age, sex, sport, history of prior concussion, and history of headache. No significant group differences were found in days to return to unrestricted play (<i>p</i> = 0.11), days after injury to start graded exertion (<i>p</i> = 0.50), duration of concussion symptoms (<i>p</i> = 0.23), days until return to normal academic performance (<i>p</i> = 0.75), and symptom burden (<i>p</i> = 0.47). Number of time zones crossed did not affect any outcomes. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Airplane travel early after concussion did not significantly affect recovery or severity of concussion symptoms in college athletes and cadets. Further studies need to investigate the possible effects of flying more acutely after injury. These data may help guide future recommendations on flight travel after concussion in athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2979000325,Observational Cohort Confirms Optic Nerve Sheath Dilation Post Valsalva in those with Prior mTBI,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the effect of mTBI on optic nerve sheath (ONS) dilation post transient increase in ICP. <h3>Background</h3> Our cross-sectional study demonstrated that those with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) at least one year following their injury have significant ONS dilation after Valsalva as measured by ultrasound compared to those without a history of mTBI. This showed that ONS dilation after Valsalva could be a potential non-invasive method of identifying individuals with a history of mTBI but needed prospective confirmation. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Mixed martial arts competitors that did not have ONS dilation of more than 0.5 mm on Valsalva, a value set based on cross-sectional study results, were enrolled in this prospective observational cohort study. Baseline pre and post-Valsalva optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurements were obtained for screening purposes. Additional ONSD measurements were collected after 1, 6, and 12 months of enrollment. Participants were monitored for suspected mTBI via self-report and monthly calls. Within two weeks following a physician-confirmed mTBI, the participant was scanned. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-one participants were enrolled and 16 (76.2%) were followed up with for one year. Three participants experienced a mTBI. Scans conducted within two weeks of the mTBI showed no significant ONS dilation post-Valsalva, which was most likely due to an elevated pre-Valsalva value compared to the participant's baseline and one-year pre-Valsalva ONSD. At the one-year testing, individuals in the mTBI group had a significantly larger post than pre-Valsalva ONSD and a significant ONS dilation post-Valsalva (n = 3, mean = 1.01mm) when compared those who did not experience a mTBI (n = 13, mean = −0.12mm; <i>p</i> = 0.0032). <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study confirms the cross-sectional study results that following a mTBI, the ONS dilates significantly following Valsalva. Further exploration is needed into exactly when this dilation is seen during a patient's recovery and why it seems delayed."
https://openalex.org/W2979037965,Resting State Functional Connectivity is Directly Related to Clinical Presentation of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To determine the utility of fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) during resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) as an advanced neuroimaging biomarker for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). <h3>Background</h3> mTBI is defined by a constellation of functional rather than structural deficits. As a measure of functional connectivity, fALFF has been implicated in long-term outcomes post-mTBI. It is unclear however, how longitudinal changes in fALFF may relate to the clinical presentation of mTBI. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> 111 patients and 32 controls (15–50 years old) were enrolled acutely after mTBI and followed with up to 4 standardized serial assessments. Patients were enrolled at either Encounter 1 (E1), within 72 hours, or Encounter 2 (E2), 5–10 days post-injury, and returned for Encounter 3 (E3) at 15–29 days and Encounter 4 (E4) at 83–97 days. Each encounter included a clinical exam, neuropsychological assessment, as well as rs-fMRI imaging. fALFF was analyzed independently in 14 functional networks and, in grey and white matter as a function of symptom severity. Symptom severity scores (SSS) ranged from 0–132 as defined by the SCAT2 symptom evaluation. <h3>Results</h3> In mTBI patients, fALFF scores across 5 functional brain networks (language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, higher-order visual, and posterior salience) differed between mTBI patients with low versus high SSS (SSS &lt;5 and &gt;30, respectively). Overall, greater SSS were indexed by reduced connectivity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.03, Bonferroni corrected). Further analysis also identified corresponding network pairs which were most predictive of increased SSS. White matter fALFF was not correlated with symptom severity, however, decreased grey matter fALFF was significantly correlated with greater SSS (<i>r</i> = −0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.002). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Grey matter fALFF was correlated with mTBI symptom burden suggesting that patterns of neural connectivity relate directly to the clinical presentation of mTBI. Furthermore, differences in functional network connectivity as a function of SSS may reflect which networks are implicated in recovery of mTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2979238698,Acute post-concussion anxiety and depression scores are not associated with duration of concussion symptoms among collegiate athletes,2019-10-01,2019,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> To investigate the association between acute post-injury scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and symptom duration in collegiate student-athletes following a concussion. <h3>Background</h3> Concussion recovery as measured by symptom resolution generally occurs within a week of injury in most athletes. In some cases, however, symptoms can persist for weeks or months. Time to symptom resolution has been associated with many factors, including psychological health. Athletes with a history of psychiatric or mood disorders prior to injury may be more likely to experience prolonged symptoms. It is unknown, however, whether initial complaints of anxiety or depression following a concussion are associated with subsequent symptom duration. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Twenty NCAA collegiate athletes (55% female, 20.10 ± 1.33 years) completed a HADS assessment within a week of sustaining a concussion. Participants then reported their post-concussion symptom scale daily until being cleared to return to sport. Date of symptom resolution was then collected at a follow-up assessment. Symptom duration was defined as the number of days between the injury and day of symptom resolution. Individual linear regressions were used to examine the relationship between HADS scores and symptom duration. <h3>Results</h3> Athletes were initially assessed at a mean of 2.65 ± 1.04 days. Mean symptom duration was 15.95 ± 17.33 days. There were no independent associations between duration of symptoms and HADS anxiety (β = 0.55, 95% CI = −1.28, 2.38, <i>p</i> = 0.63), HADS depression (β = −0.21, 95% CI = −3.08, 2.67, <i>p</i> = 0.88), or total HADS scores (β = 0.23, 95% CI = −1.07, 1.53, <i>p</i> = 0.71). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Post-injury anxiety and depression scores did not appear to influence symptom duration in concussed collegiate student-athletes. While mental health should continue to be monitored during recovery, duration of symptoms is likely influenced by a multifaceted set of factors that are highly variable across collegiate athletes who sustain a concussion."

Participants completed the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) and timed tandem gait (TTG) test independently (single task [ST]) and concurrently (DT). The revised SAC (45 points) which included a 10-word list was utilized. The TTG composite score was a sum of the average time to completion for each SAC task (3 trials for immediate memory [10-word list], up to 5 trials for the digits-backwards task, and one trial for the months in reverse order and delayed recall tasks). Independent <i>t</i>-tests were used to assess for sex differences for SAC and TTG performance during ST and DT administration. 2 × 2 factorial analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to assess for sex (male, female) by task (ST, DT) interaction effects with effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d. All analyses were assessed at α = 0.05. <h3>Results</h3> No sex differences were observed for ST performance of the SAC (males = 37.1 ± 3.45 points, females = 37.4 ± 3.74 points; <i>t</i>[58] = 0.28, <i>p</i> = 0.78) or TTG (males = 44.3 ± 7.09 seconds, females = 46.1 ± 8.88 seconds; <i>t</i>[58] = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.38). No sex differences were observed for DT performance of the SAC (males = 39.7 ± 4.50 points, females = 39.2 ± 3.12 points; <i>t</i>[58] = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.64) or TTG (males = 52.1 ± 8.56 seconds, females = 52.1 ± 10.28 seconds; <i>t</i>[58] = 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.98). No sex by task interaction effects were observed for SAC (F = 0.74, <i>p</i> = 0.39, <i>d</i> = 0.23) or TTG (F = 1.1, <i>p</i> = 0.30, <i>d</i> = 0.28) performance for ST or DT assessment. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our results indicate that our novel DT assessment was robust to sex differences in healthy college students which supports the utilization of our DT assessment across sexes without adjustment for interpretation."

All 50 states have legislation mandating safety and prevention efforts aimed at reducing the burden of injury amongst the high school athlete population. Efforts include mandated concussion education for both athletes and their parents/ guardians. Previous studies have found that education leads to improved recognition of symptoms and improved outcomes. However, completion has not been formally assessed and factors that are associated with the completion are unknown. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data collected during fall of 2017. Data for pre-identified demographic factors (eg. race, ethnicity, student grade level, highest education, income level) were extracted and summarized using descriptive statistics. Only participants who provided responses to variables of interest were included in this analysis (n = 224 dyads of student athlete and their parent/ guardian). Chi Square test of significance assessed associations between factors and completion of concussion education. Analyses performed using SAS version 9.4. <h3>Results</h3> The majority of student athletes self-identified as male (n = 123; 55.2%), white (n = 185; 87.7%) and non-hispanic (n = 192; 93.2%). Student athletes, who were older, in higher grade levels, had a history of concussion, and had parents/legal guardians with higher levels of education reported completing concussion education at higher proportions. Parents/ guardians reported completion of concussion education at higher proportions if they had a higher stated family income, their student athlete was in a higher grade level, and if their student athlete had a history of concussion. <h3>Conclusions</h3> A number of factors are associated with higher self-reported completion of mandated concussion education, identifying a gap. Further investigation is necessary to ensure all student athletes and their parent/guardian are educated about concussion."
https://openalex.org/W2979552361,Performance Motion Analysis Unable to Predict Running-Related Injury in Collegiate Distance Runners,2019-10-01,2019,article,"Purpose: Running-related injury (RRI) is common among competitive collegiate distance runners who participate in the sport of cross country and long distance track and field. Many factors contribute to RRI. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if a 3D motion capture system’s performance motion analysis (PMA) report is capable of identifying factors predictive of RRI among collegiate distance runners during a cross country season. Methods: Thirty-one collegiate cross country runners (17 male, 14 female, mean age = 20.5 ± 1.4 years) gave their consent to participate in the investigation. Subjects were screened in the motion capture system and provided with PMA reports assessing their movement quality using several variables (composite score, power, strength, dysfunction, and vulnerability, based on measurements of 192 kinetic and kinematic variables). The athletes were then monitored throughout their 13-week competitive season for incidence of RRI. At the end of the season, participants were sorted into injured (n=17) and uninjured (n=14) groups. Injury was defined as appearing on the team injury report as missing or being limited in practice or competition for a week or more, in accordance with prior RRI research. Each sex was also separated into groups based on injury status. Results: Independent samples t-tests (pConclusion: The findings identified in this prospective study suggest that the movement screen was unable to identify runners at risk of injury. Future investigations isolating lower extremity movement characteristics in runners may prove more effective at predicting RRI."
https://openalex.org/W2982287465,Return to Sport Following Turf Toe Injuries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2019-10-01,2019,review,"Category: Sports Introduction/Purpose: The prevalence of turf toe injuries has increased in recent years due to heightened awareness and the large number of athletes participating in sports today. Uncertainty remains, however, as to how to properly treat turf toe and the prognosis for these injured athletes. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to provide recommendations on treatment of turf toe and expectations for outcomes and return to play. Methods: Following PRISMA criteria, a systematic review and meta-analysis using the PubMed/Ovid Medline/PMC databases was performed (May 1964 – August 2018). Studies evaluating non-turf toe injuries, biomechanical studies, and those written in non- English language were excluded. Return to sport, treatment, severity of injury, athletic position, and sport were recorded and statistically analyzed. Results: 12/944 studies met criteria, which included 112 athletes and 120 turf toe injuries. The athletes played a variety of sports: football (111), basketball (2), soccer (1), and track (3). 58 of these injuries were treated non-operatively, while 62 required surgery. There was one grade 1 injury, ten grade 2 injuries, and fifty-four grade 3 injuries. Fifty-five injuries were unclassifiable and excluded. Return to sport for patients treated non-operatively was 5.9 weeks versus 19.2 weeks in patients treated operatively (p=0.007). Patients with a grade 2 injury returned to sport quicker (11.7 weeks) than patients with grade 3 injuries (19.9 weeks) (p=0.016). Return to play was different according to the athlete’s level of play (13.9 weeks high school, 16.8 weeks college, 14.4 weeks professional) (p=0.018). Conclusion: Return to sport in patients suffering from a turf toe injury can be affected by either the severity of injury and/or level of competition of the athlete. However, this study also acknowledges the limited number of high level studies evaluating turf toe in the athletic population. Further research is necessary to clearly define appropriate treatment and return to play protocols based on sport, position, and level of play."

It is possible that neurocognitive deficits from earlier eAFE to American football, if present, are sufficiently compensated for in otherwise healthy individuals, but when faced with concussion, earlier eAFE may associate with longer symptom recovery, worse cognitive performance, or greater psychological distress. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Participants were recruited as part of the NCAA–DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium. There were 340 NCAA football players (age = 18.9 ± 1.4 years) who were evaluated 24–48 hours following concussion and had valid baseline data and 360 (age = 19.0 ± 1.3 years) who were evaluated at the time they were asymptomatic and had valid baseline data. Participants sustained a medically-diagnosed concussion between baseline testing and post-concussion assessments. Outcome measures included the number of days until asymptomatic, Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) composite scores, Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18) sub-scores, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. The eAFE was defined as the participant's age at the time of assessment minus the self-reported number of years playing football. <h3>Results</h3> Results of generalized linear modeling suggested that younger eAFE was only associated with lower (better) BSI-18 Somatization (estimate = 0.046, <i>p</i> = 0.046, CI = 0.001–0.091) and BSI-18 Anxiety sub-scores (estimate = 0.053, <i>p</i> = 0.039, CI = 0.003–0.104) at 24–48 hours. The eAFE was not associated with days until asymptomatic, ImPACT composite scores, HADS scores, or other BSI-18 sub-scores. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Earlier eAFE to football was not associated with longer symptom recovery, worse cognitive performance, or greater psychological distress following concussion. Longer duration of exposure to football during childhood and adolescence appears to be unrelated to clinical recovery following concussion."

On the other hand, same studies showed that the practice of physical exercise can improve stability. Objectives: Thus, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the influence of physical exercise, in this case in a football player, on the EPAs of athletes with CP. Methods: The study included 5 young male adults with CP, aged between 18 and 36 years old, all football players, class 7 and 8.The electromyographic activity was recorded using Delsys Trigno and the ratio of the postural musculature [soleus (SO) and tibialis anterior (TA)] prior to a step motion, as well as the center of pressure displacement amplitude were calculated through the force platforms (Bertec), before and after a 4 month interval of training. The two moments of evaluation were compared using the Wilcoxon test and the Spearman correlation between the CoP amplitude and the muscular activity ratio was calculated.Participants were recruited in a first period in which they had no physical activity at all and in the following 4 months they started training regularly, with a frequency of three times a week for 1h30min, always with the same trainer and in the same physical training space. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in the anterior CoP amplitude (-4.47cm; p=0.043) after 4 months, with a negative correlation between this amplitude and the ratio of TA / SO (r=-0.90; p=0.037). In the lateral direction, a diminution of amplitude of minimum CoP (-1.49; p=0.893) without statistically significant correlation (r=0.10; p=0.873) was found. Conclusions: Practicing sport, even in pathology, has a significant effect on the improvement of postural oscillation, with an increase in the relationship between muscular activity and postural control."

The electromyographic and biomechanical comparisons were conducted.To compare the electromyographic activities of the thigh and shank muscles and isometric peak torque (PT) before and after walking training on a floor or in the end-effector gait robot.Twelve outpatients without ambulatory dysfunction were recruited. Order of two interventions (5-min training on a floor at a comfortable pace or training in an EEGR with non-weight bearing on their feet and 100% guidance force at 2.1 km/h) were randomly chosen. Isometric PT, maximal ratio of torque development, amplitude of compound motor action potential (CMAP), and area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated before and 10 min after both interventions.The degree of PT improvement of the dominant knee flexors was larger in the EEGR than on the floor (9.6 ± 22.4 Nm/BW, P < 0.01). The EEGR-trained patients had greater PT improvement of the dominant knee extensors than those who trained on the floor (4.5 ± 28.1 Nm/BW, P < 0.01). However, all electromyographic activities of the thigh and shank muscles (peak CMAP, mean and peak AUC) were significantly lower for the use of the EEGR than walking on the floor.Immediate strengthening of the knee flexors and extensors was induced after the 5-min EEGR training, despite reduced muscular use."

https://openalex.org/W2975817668,Running Velocity Does Not Influence Lower Limb Mechanical Asymmetry,2019-09-24,2019,article,"We examined the effect of running velocity upon magnitude and range of asymmetry in the main kinetics and kinematics of treadmill running at constant, submaximal velocities. Nine well-trained, un-injured distance runners ran, in a random order, at seven running velocities (10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5 and 25 km.h-1) for 60 s (separated by > 90 s of rest) on an instrumented treadmill (ADAL3D-WR, Medical Development, France). Continuous measurement (1000 Hz) of spatio-temporal, horizontal force production and spring-mass characteristics was performed and data over 10 consecutive steps (5 right and 5 leg foot contacts after 50 s of running) were used for subsequent comparisons. Group mean and the range of asymmetry scores were assessed from the ‘symmetry angle’ (SA) formulae where a score of 0%/100% indicates perfect symmetry/asymmetry. Mean SA scores for spatio-temporal variables were lower than 2%: contact time (0.6±0.1%; range: 0.4–0.7%), aerial time (1.7±0.2%; range: 1.3–2.1%) as well as step length and step frequency (0.7±0.2%; range: 0.5–0.9%). Mean loading rate (5.3±1.1%; range: 4.1–6.9%) and spring mass model peak vertical force: 3.2±1.6% (range: 2.9–3.4%); maximal downward vertical displacement: 11.2±6.0% (range: 9.2–14.0%); leg compression: 3.6±1.9% (range: 2.9–5.6%); vertical stiffness: 8.8±1.9% (range: 7.1–11.6%); leg stiffness: 1.6±0.6% (range: 1.2–2.9%) presented larger mean SA values. Mean SA scores ranged 1-4% for duration of braking (1.3±0.3%; range: 0.9–2.0%) and push-off (1.6±0.9%; range: 1.2–2.4%) phases, peak braking (2.4±1.1%; range: 1.6–3.6%) and push-off (1.7±0.9%; range: 1.2–2.2%) forces as well as braking (3.7±2.0%; range: 2.8–5.8%) and push-off (2.1±0.8%; range: 1.3–2.6%) impulses. However, with the exception of braking impulse (P=0.005), there was no influence of running velocity on asymmetry scores for any of the mechanical variables studied (0.118<P<0.920). Modifying treadmill belt velocity between 10 and 25 km.h-1 induced large adjustments in most running kinetics and kinematics. However, there was no noticeable difference in group mean and the range of asymmetry values across running velocities, with the magnitude of these scores being largely dependent on the biomechanical variable of interest. Finally, the relatively large range of asymmetry between participants for some variables reinforces the importance of assessing asymmetry on an individual basis."
https://openalex.org/W2996021325,Understanding rumination as a form of inner speech: probing the role of motor processes,2019-09-24,2019,preprint,"Rumination is known to be a predominantly verbal process and has been proposed to be considered as such as a dysfunctional form of inner speech (i.e., the silent production of words in one’s mind). On the other hand, research on the psychophysiology of inner speech revealed that the neural processes involved in overt and covert speech tend to be very similar. This is coherent with the idea that some forms of inner speech could be considered as a kind of simulation of overt speech, in the same way as imagined actions can be considered as the result of a simulation of the corresponding overt action (e.g., walking and imagined walking). In other words, the motor simulation hypothesis suggests that the speech motor system should be involved as well during inner speech production. The corollary hypothesis might be drawn, according to which the production of inner speech (and rumination) should be disrupted by a disruption of the speech motor system. We conducted a series of five studies aiming to probe the role of the speech motor system in rumination. Overall, our results highlight that although verbal rumination may be considered as a form of inner speech, it might not specifically involve the speech motor system. More precisely, we argue that rumination might be considered as a particularly strongly condensed form of inner speech that does not systematically involve fully specified articulatory features. We discuss these findings in relation to the habit-goal framework of depressive rumination and we discuss the implications of these findings for theories of inner speech production."

This systematic reviewed synthesized evidence of thoracic spine mobility during UL movement in athletes. Using three reviewers at each stage, key databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up to 30/6/18. Eligibility criteria: adults age 18-40 (reflecting athletic population) and studies assessing thoracic spine and UL movement. Quality assessment was evaluated using AXIS tool and GRADE for overall quality of evidence. Seven studies were included (n = 168, mean age 26.4 years, 33% males) with n = 20 in an athlete population. Main findings were: Unilateral and bilateral UL flexion resulted in 6.7-8.0 and 12.0-12.8° thoracic extension, respectively. Unilateral and bilateral UL abduction resulted in 3.0-4.0 and 9.0-15.0 and degrees, respectively. Other thoracic spine movement (lower and upper, rotation and lateral flexion) was variable across movement planes. Overall there was unequivocal evidence of thoracic spine movement, mainly extension during UL movement and notably at the end of elevation across all planes. Findings support further targeted high-quality research and examination of thoracic mobility, an essential link in the kinetic chain, in practice."

Virtual environments (VE) have garnered interest as a tool to train real-world sports skills due to the realism and flexibility that they can deliver. A key assumption of VE-based training is that the learned skills and experiences transfer to the real world, but do they? Using PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review evaluated the available evidence regarding the transfer of motor skills from VE training to real-world sporting contexts. The initial search identified 448 articles, but only 4 of these articles met basic criteria necessary to assess real-world transfer. Key factors regarding the study design, learner characteristics and training environment of these studies are considered. In a relatively new area of research, the findings from these 4 articles are encouraging and provide initial support for the notion that skills training in a VE can improve real-world performance in sports. However, for a wider uptake of VEs in sports training, it is important that more research demonstrates real-world transfer. Study design recommendations are suggested for researchers, developers or trainers who are considering demonstrating real-world transfers from virtual to real-world environments."

Baseline and follow-up testing of jump-landing technique included drop vertical jumps (DVJ), assessed subjectively and with two-dimensional movement analysis, and tuck jump assessment (TJA).Only minor differences in intervention effects were seen between the two IPEPs, and results are therefore presented for both intervention groups combined. At baseline 30% of the boys showed good knee control during the DVJ, normalised knee separation distances of 77-96% (versus hip) and a median of 3 flaws during the TJA. Among girls, 22% showed good knee control, normalised knee separation distances of 67-86% and a median of 4 flaws during the TJA. At follow-up, boys and girls performed significantly more jumps during TJA.

Despite these associations, assessments of knee function in athletic populations at the time of return to sport following ACL reconstruction (ACLr) have often focused on strength and single-leg hop tests, with a paucity of evidence to describe the CoD characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review was to describe the movement strategies exhibited following ACLr during CoD tasks and to critically analyze the range of tests that have been used. Specifically, we examined their ability to identify between-limb deficits and individuals who display a heightened risk of secondary injury and/or reductions in their level of pre-injury performance. MEDLINE, PubMed and SPORT Discuss databases were used and 13 articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Examination of the available literature indicates that current field-based practices are not representative of relevant sport demands and are unable to effectively assess knee function following ACLr. Laboratory-based studies have identified residual deficits and altered movement strategies at the time of return to sport, and this in part may be related to risk of re-injury. However, these assessments exhibit inherent limitations and are not practically viable for monitoring progress during rehabilitation. Consequently, alternative solutions that are more-aligned with the multitude of factors occurring during CoD maneuvers in chaotic sports environments are warranted to allow practitioners to 'bridge the gap' between the laboratory and the sports field/court. This approach may facilitate a more informed decision-making process with the end goal being, a heightened 'return to performance' and a lower risk of re-injury."

Demographic data and training details of the athletes were recorded. The MTSS score was used to determine the severity of the injury. The navicular drop test, lower extremity length measurement, and isokinetic muscle strength measurement were performed. Results: The complaint duration of the patients with MTSS (n:21) was 1.8 ± 1.8 months and the MTSS score was 3.9 ± 2.2. The control group (n:12) and the athletes diagnosed with MTSS had similar demographic characteristics and training details. There was no difference between the groups in terms of navicular drop and lower extremity length. There was no ‘lower extremity difference’ for right and left extremities.

Factors favoring its incurrence are: age and gender, type of sport activity, biomechanical factors, muscles, training errors, groundwork, sports footwear and hormonal imbalance. Most affected are athletes involved in sports where strong kicks are present (running, basketball, soccer and gymnastics). For the diagnosis of stress fractures most commonly used are clinical diagnostics, radiological diagnostics, scintigraphy and differential diagnosis. The prevention of such an injury requires the identification and elimination of risk factors associated with participation in contact sports, as well as the development of training plans and programs tailored for every sport and athlete. Also important for prevention is a quality co-operation between doctors, athletes and trainers, as well as regular conditional preparation, timely treatment of injuries and the compilation of a rehabilitation program. As far as rehabilitation itself is concerned, it starts immediately after injury, and it includes rest and immobilization, isometric exercises, balance exercises and proprioception, hydrotherapy, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, LASER, magnetotherapy, sports massage, stretching, regeneration methods, proprioceptive training, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), nuclear neurodynamics (NDS), manual techniques (mobilization and manipulation techniques, Kaltenborn Evens, Cyriax, Maitland, McKenzie), Kinesiotape, soft tissue techniques (fascial manipulation, friction massage, functional massages), Emmett, Bowen, Rolfing, Yumeiho, Theraband, bandages etc."

To better comprehend the inter-relatedness of ecologies and human behaviors, there have been increasing calls for transdisciplinary approaches and holistic ecological models. In this paper we explore an ecological dynamics rationale for creativity, highlighting the conceptual adjacency of key concepts from transdisciplinarity, dynamic systems theory, ecological psychology and social-cognitive psychology. Our aim is to extend the scope of ecological dynamics and contextualize the application of non-linear pedagogy in sport. Foregrounding the role of sociocultural constraints on creative behaviors, we characterize the athlete-environment system as an ecological niche that arises from, and simultaneously co-creates, a form of life. We elaborate the notion that creative moments, skill and more generally talent in sport, are not traits possessed by individuals alone, but rather can be conceived as properties of the athlete-environment system shaped by changing constraints. This re-conceptualization supports a pedagogical approach predicated on notions of athletes and sports teams as complex adaptive systems. In such systems, continuous non-linear interactions between system components support the exploration of fluent and flexibly creative performance solutions by athletes and sports teams. The implications for practice suggest that cultivating a constellation of constraints can facilitate adaptive exploration of novel affordances (opportunities/invitation for action), fostering creative moments and supporting creative development in athletes. Future models or frameworks for practice contend that pedagogies should emerge from, and evolve in, interaction with the sociocultural context in which practitioners and athletes are embedded."

Computational tools such as finite element (FE) models provide an avenue for researchers to study, and potentially optimize safety tools, such as helmets. The goal of this study was to develop an accurate representative helmet model that could be used in further study of head injury to mitigate the toll of concussions in contact sports. An FE model of a Schutt Air XP Pro football helmet was developed through three major steps: geometry development, material characterization, and model validation. The fully assembled helmet model was fit onto a Hybrid III dummy head-neck model and National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) head model and validated through a series of 67 representative impacts similar to those experienced by a football player. The kinematic and kinetic response of the model was compared to the response of the physical experiments, which included force, head linear acceleration, head angular velocity, and carriage acceleration. The outputs between the model and the physical tests were quantitatively evaluated using CORelation and Analysis (CORA), amounting to an overall averaged score of 0.76. The model described in this study has been extensively validated and can function as a building block for innovation in player safety."

Previous works showed that expert defenders are more efficient in detecting deceptive motions. Performance was shown to be correlated with the evolution of the center of gravity of the attacker, suggesting that experts may rely on global motion cues. This study aims at investigating whether a representation of center of gravity can be useful for training purposes, by using this representation alone or by combining it with the local motion cues given by body parts. We designed an experiment in virtual reality to control the motion cues available to the defenders. Sixteen healthy participants (seven experts and nine novices) acted as defenders while a virtual attacker approached. Participants completed two separate tasks. The first was a time occlusion perception task, occlusion after 100ms, 200ms or 300ms after the initial change in direction, thereafter participants indicated the passing direction of the attacker. The second was a perception-action task, participants were instructed to intercept the oncoming attacker by displacing medio-laterally. The attacker performed either a non-deceptive motion, directly toward the final passing direction or a deceptive motion, initially toward a false direction before quickly reorienting to the true direction. There was a main effect of expertise, appearance, cut off times and motion on correct responses during both tasks. There was an interaction between visual appearance and expertise, and between motion type and expertise during the perception task, however, this interaction was not present during the perception-action task. We observed that experts maintained superiority in the perception of deceptive motion; however when the visual appearance is reduced to global motion alone the difference between novices and experts is reduced. We further explore the interactions and discuss the effects observed for the visual appearance and expertise."

Ten male athletes were involved in a randomized, crossover study. The subjects performed 3 sets of 6 repetitions of EOL or TW half squat exercise followed by SLJ, CMJ, and 5 m sprint tests at 1 min, 3 min and 7 min, in separate sessions using a randomized order. Bayes factor (BF10) was reported to show the strength of the evidence. Differences were found using EOL for SLJ distance at 3 min (BF10 = 7.24, +8%), and 7 min (BF10 = 19.5, +7%), for CMJ at 3 min (BF10 = 3.25, +9%), and 7 min (BF10 = 4.12, +10.5%). Differences were found using TW exercise for SLJ at 3 min (BF10 = 3.88, +9%), and 7 min (BF10 = 12.4, +9%), CMJ at 3 min (BF10 = 7.42, +9.5%), and 7 min (BF10 = 12.4, +12%). No meaningful differences were found between EOL and TW exercises for SLJ (BF10 = 0.33), CMJ (BF10 = 0.27), and 5 m sprint (BF10 = 0.22). In conclusion, EOL and TW exercises acutely increase SLJ and CMJ, but not 5 m sprint performance. The PAP time window was found between 3 min and 7 min using both protocols. This study did not find differences between EOL and TW exercises, and so both methodologies can be used to stimulate a PAP response."

Different data sources were analyzed up to January 2018. Eligible studies contained information on population (young athletes), intervention (neuromuscular training), comparator (control group or another exercise intervention), outcomes (injury prevention or sport performance), and study design (randomized trials or prospective studies). The trials were restricted based on the language (English) and for publication date (after 1 January 2007). Fourteen randomized controlled trials were included: Seven included dynamic stability-related outcomes. Three assessed the coordination performing fundamental movements and sport-specific skills, while other five studies analyzed muscle strength and two assessed plyometric tests. Agility was evaluated in three studies and speed tests were also considered by four studies. Finally, fatigue resistance in three studies and injury risk in four were assessed. This review provides evidence that integrative neuromuscular training programs can enhance performance and injury prevention in young athletes, taken into account that adherence to the training program is adequate. Collectively, well-designed, randomized studies are necessary to collaborate with the present findings."

Evaluating the impact of frameworks can identify whether and how a framework was used, how it has evolved, and what trends have developed over time. However, studying the impact of such theoretical contributions requires consideration of various perspectives and level of impact. As a case study for investigating the impact of theoretical work in HCI, we present our evaluation of the impact of the Reality Based Interaction (RBI) framework, introduced by the authors in 2008. We provide our findings about the impact of the framework both on contemporary research, through content-based citation analysis, and in HCI education, through a survey we conducted on emerging interaction frameworks. The article contributes a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the impact of frameworks through our twofold approach: content-based citation analysis, including the design of a new citation typology; and a survey on the use of frameworks in education using a taxonomy of learning goals. We also consider the role of frameworks in HCI as well as the future of the RBI framework."

Purpose: To expand on the relationship between concussion and lower extremity injury by examining the effect of multiple concussions (MC) on rate and odds of future lower extremity injury in collegiate athletes after return to play (RTP) compared with matched controls. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: From 2001 to 2016, 48 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes sustaining multiple concussions at a single institution were identified. Athletes with multiple concussions (MC) were matched directly to athletes with a single concussion (SC) and to athletes with no concussion history (NC) by sex, sport, position, and games played. Incidence of, time to, and location of lower extremity injury were recorded for each group after RTP from their first reported concussion until completion of their collegiate career. Logistic regression was used to analyze odds ratios (ORs) for sustaining lower extremity injury, whereas time to injury was summarized by use of Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test analysis. Results: The incidence of lower extremity injury after RTP was significantly greater ( P = .049) in the MC cohort (36/48, 75%) than in SC athletes (25/48 = 52%) and NC athletes (27/48 = 56%). Similarly, odds of lower extremity injury were significantly greater in the MC cohort than in SC athletes (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.26-7.12; P = .01) and NC athletes (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07-2.56; P = .02). Time to lower extremity injury was significantly shorter in the MC group compared with matched controls ( P = .01). No difference was found in odds of lower extremity injury or time to lower extremity injury between SC and NC athletes. Conclusion: Collegiate athletes with MC were more likely to sustain a lower extremity injury after RTP in a shorter time frame than were the matched SC and NC athletes. This may suggest the presence of a cohort more susceptible to neuromuscular deficits after concussion or more injury prone due to player behavior, and it may imply the need for more stringent RTP protocols for athletes experiencing MC."

One key metric that can be derived from IMUs are relative angles of body segments which are important for monitoring form in many sports. The purpose of this study was to (a) examine the validity of relative angles derived from IMUs placed on the torso and pelvis; and (b) determine optimal positioning for torso mounted sensors such that the IMU relative angles match closely with gold standard torso–pelvis and thorax–pelvis relative angle data derived from an optoelectronic camera system. Seventeen adult participants undertook a variety of motion tasks. Four IMUs were positioned on the torso and one was positioned on the pelvis between the posterior superior iliac spines. Reflective markers were positioned around each IMU and over torso and pelvis landmarks. Results showed that the IMUs are valid with the root mean square errors expressed as a percentage of the angle range (RMSE%) ranging between 1% and 7%. Comparison between the IMU relative angles and the torso–pelvis and thorax–pelvis relative angles showed there were moderate to large differences with RMSE% values ranging between 4% and 57%. IMUs are highly accurate at measuring orientation data; however, further work is needed to optimise positioning and modelling approaches so IMU relative angles align more closely with relative angles derived using traditional motion capture methods."

Research efforts in sports injury risk reduction are offering more and more solutions; however, implementation seems to be lagging behind. Research results are mainly disseminated through professional journals, which may restrict their accessibility. Therefore, Internet-based resources may be a useful complement, but their availability, content and quality are not yet known.Objectives: To assess the availability, content and quality of sports injury risk reduction exercise-based programs in an online environment.Method: Google, Yahoo and Bing search engines will be used. Two researchers will independently review the retrieved websites for eligibility through an initial and an in-depth screening. Inactive pages or duplicate pages will be excluded. For each retrieved program data on website and program characteristics will be extracted. The JAMA benchmark criteria and HONcode certification will be used to judge the quality of the websites, and the quality of the exercise programs will be assessed via modified CERT.Discussion: In light of implementation delays in sports injury risk reduction practices, there is a need to broaden dissemination strategies to include media such as the Internet. At the same time, there is also a need to assess the quality and content of online-based resources to guide their potential use. The outcomes of this review will inform clinicians, coaches and others of the current availability and content of injury risk reduction exercise-based programs on the Internet."

Ground reaction forces (GRF) were collected from two AMTI force platforms (1200 Hz) embedded into the running track to examine penultimate (PEN) and final (FC) contact.Results: Both preferred and non-preferred limbs involved greater hip (ES = 2.85–3.81) and knee joint flexion angles (ES = 5.74–5.78) and peak vertical GRFs (ES = 0.87–1.61), but lower average vertical (ES = 2.55–3.01) and horizontal GRFs (ES = 3.05–3.67) during the PEN compared to the FC. Knee abduction angles were very likely greater (ES = 0.61) when turning off the non-preferred limb compared to the preferred limb.Conclusion: These findings may help us question the role of limb preference during pivoting, yet knee abduction angles and moments should be monitored with caution in female soccer players. Thus, it remains inconclusive the role limb preference plays in change of direction biomechanics for performance and risk of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2972814348,Effects of Post-Activation Potentiation induced by a plyometric protocol on deceleration performance,2019-09-11,2019,preprint,"Abstract Post-Activation Potentiation is a phenomenon by which muscular performance characteristics are acutely enhanced as a result of their previous contractile actions. It has been shown how Post-Activation Potentiation, which is usually evoked through heavy resistance exercise, has the potential to improve many different power performances, such as sprinting and jumping. Due to an easier applicability, some studies explored the potential of plyometric muscular actions to evoke the effects of Post-Activation Potentiation. Despite some findings on acceleration running performance, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies investigated the effects of Post-Activation Potentiation on deceleration performance, which is a key factor in sports involving change of directions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a plyometric exercise protocol to a subsequent deceleration running performance. University soccer players (n = 18) performed 7 deceleration trials: at baseline and after ∼ 15 seconds, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 minutes a walking control condition (C) or 3 sets of 10 repetitions of alternate-leg bounding (plyometric, P). Results show that no significant differences were found at any of the trials of the control condition (C) in comparison to the relative baseline. In the plyometric condition (P), the deceleration performance executed 2 minutes after the plyometric activity resulted significantly faster compared to the relative baseline (p = 0.042; ES = 0.86, large effect; % of improvement = 4.13 %). Therefore, the main findings of this study showed that a plyometric exercise has the potential to improve a subsequent running deceleration performance in soccer players, if an adequate recovery between these activities is provided to the players. These findings encourage further future investigations about the possible potentiating effects of plyometric activities on more complex actions like changes of direction and agility."

Objectives: The main purpose was to determine whether asymmetry between the preferred and non-preferred lower limb is present in the lower limb tendon structure, muscle architecture and stiffness values of professional badminton players.Sixteen male professional badminton players (age = 24.1 ± 6.7 years; body height = 177.90 ± 7.53 cm) participated in this study. The muscle architecture of the vastus lateralis (VL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and the structure of patellar and Achilles tendons were measured in the dominant and non-dominant lower limb with ultrasonography. Stiffness was also measured at the same points with a hand-held MyotonPro. Significant differences between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb were determined using Student's t test for related samples.Bilateral differences were observed for thickness, width and cross-sectional area (CSA) in both tendons showing higher values for the dominant side: patellar tendon CSA (2.02 ± 0.64 vs. 1.51 ± 0.42 cm2; p < 0.05) and Achilles tendon CSA (1.12 ± 0.18 vs. 0.92 ± 0.28 cm2; p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in muscle architecture and myotonic variables between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb.The prolonged practice of badminton caused asymmetries in the CSA, width and thickness of the patellar and Achilles tendon between the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. No bilateral differences were found in the muscle architecture of VL, MG and LG or in the stiffness of any muscle or tendon analyzed."

The COR group undertook a 4-week, core-specific training program concurrently with their typical training program, whilst the CON group completed 4 weeks of typical training only. Both groups completed overhead medicine ball throw (OMBT), Suplexes, bridges and medicine ball chest throw (MBCT) prior to and following the intervention.The COR group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in bridges (p= 0.037; F= 5.046) and OMBT (p< 0.001; F= 26.43) than the CON group, with moderate to large between-group effect sizes (ES = 0.79-2.35). In addition, the effect size calculations were moderate-to-large (0.79-0.87) for Suplex and MBCT, with measures for the COR group greater than the CON group.Accordingly, core-specific training programs should be combined with wrestling-specific conditioning programs to improve back and hip extensor performance in junior Greco-Roman wrestlers."

In particular, predicting players' performance using past observations is a considerable challenge. The purpose of this study is to forecast the future behavior of basketball players. The available data are sparse functional data, which are very common in sports. So far, however, no forecasting method designed for sparse functional data has been used in sports. A methodology based on two methods to handle sparse and irregular data, together with the analogous method and functional archetypoid analysis is proposed. Results in comparison with traditional methods show that our approach is competitive and additionally provides prediction intervals. The methodology can also be used in other sports when sparse longitudinal data are available."
https://openalex.org/W2972736158,Age-related differences of inter-joint coordination in elderly during squat jumping,2019-09-09,2019,article,"Background Explosive movement requires that the individual exerts force and power with appropriate magnitude and timing. These coordination aspects have received less attention despite being a basic prerequisite for daily mobility and physical autonomy, especially in older people. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of age on inter-joint coordination during explosive movement. Methods Twenty-one elderly and twenty young participants performed three maximal vertical jumps, while kinematics were recorded throughout each squat jump. Inter-joint coordination and coordination variability were calculated for selected sagittal hip-knee, knee-ankle, and hip-ankle joint couplings using the continuous relative phase method. Results The young participants produced significantly greater jump height performance (0.36 ± 0.07 m vs. 0.12 ± 0.04 m, p < 0.001). The mean absolute continuous relative phase for ankle-knee and knee-hip joint couplings were significantly greater for the elderly in comparison to the young group (p < 0.01 for the both). No significant differences between senior and young participants in the mean absolute continuous relative phase for ankle-hip joint couplings (p = 0.25) was observed. However, there was significantly more variability in inter-joint coordination in the elderly marked by greater continuous relative phase variabilities in ankle-knee, ankle-hip and knee-hip joint couplings (p < 0.001) than those observed in young adults. Conclusion In this study, seniors demonstrated proximodistal inter-joint coordination but with different delays in the pattern of inter-joint coordination during squat jumps compared to young adults. In addition, a higher continuous relative phase variability in the elderly may be needed to improve stability or compensate for strength deficits in jump achievement."
https://openalex.org/W2971590753,The relationship between sprint speed and sprint motion in amputee soccer players,2019-09-07,2019,article,"Sprint performance plays an important role in amputee soccer.Sprint motion such as step length and frequency are generally accepted as one of the determining factors of sprint performance.However, there is a paucity of sprint motion studies.Here we sought to analyze sprint motion in outfield positioned amputee soccer players using crutches and to clarify the relationship between sprint speed and sprint motion.Twelve male Japanese outfield players participated; they performed a 30-m sprint with maximum effort.Sprint times and speeds were recorded using electronic timing gates.A high-speed video camera recorded sprint motion.The time and distance of each crutch and step were determined via image analysis.Sprint speed was significantly positively correlated with body mass (r=0.692,p=0.013), length and frequency of one running cycle(r=0.817,p=0.001; r=0.666, p=0.018, respectively), 1st-2nd step length (r=0.890,p=0.001), and crutch-1st step length (r=0.659,p=0.020).In addition, sprint speed was significantly negatively correlated with time taken for each 10-m interval as well as with contact time of first foot (r=-0.881,p=0.001) and crutch stance time (r=-0.670,p=0.017).Our results suggest that improving sprint speed requires increasing the step length within a shorter time frame in first foot step and crutch stance."

https://openalex.org/W2971888064,The Effect of Training Interventions on Change of Direction Biomechanics Associated with Increased Anterior Cruciate Ligament Loading: A Scoping Review,2019-09-06,2019,review,"Change of direction (COD) manoeuvres are associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk due to the propensity to generate large multiplanar knee joint loads. Given the short- and long-term consequences of ACL injury, practitioners are interested in methods that reduce knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading. An effective strategy to reduce ACL loading is modifying an athlete's movement mechanics to reduce knee joint loading. The purpose of this scoping review was to critically appraise and comprehensively synthesise the existing literature related to the effects of training interventions on COD biomechanics associated with increased knee joint loads and subsequent ACL loading, and identify gaps and recommend areas for future research. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and Sport DISCUS databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of pre-post analysis of a COD task, a minimum 4-week training intervention, and assessments of biomechanical characteristics associated with increased ACL loading. Of the 1,027 articles identified, 22 were included in the scoping review. Based on current literature, balance training and COD technique modification are the most effective training modalities for reducing knee joint loading (small to moderate effect sizes). One study reported dynamic core stability training was effective in reducing knee joint loads, but further research is needed to definitively confirm the efficacy of this method. Perturbation-enhanced plyometric training, the F-MARC 11 + soccer specific warm-up, Oslo Neuromuscular warm-up, and resistance training are ineffective training modalities to reduce COD knee joint loads. Conflicting findings have been observed for the Core-Pac and mixed training programme. Consequently, practitioners should consider incorporating balance and COD technique modification drills into their athletes' training programmes to reduce potentially hazardous knee joint loads when changing direction. However, training intervention studies can be improved by investigating larger sample sizes (> 20), including a control group, acknowledging measurement error when interpreting their findings, and considering performance implications, to confirm the effectiveness of training interventions and improve adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2971834752,The Effects of Six-Weeks Change of Direction Speed and Technique Modification Training on Cutting Performance and Movement Quality in Male Youth Soccer Players,2019-09-06,2019,article,"Cutting manoeuvres are important actions associated with soccer performance and a key action associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury; thus, training interventions that can improve cutting performance and movement quality are of great interest. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effects of a six-week change of dire[ction (COD) speed and technique modification training intervention on cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players (U17s, n = 8) in comparison to a control group (CG) (U18s, n = 11) who continued 'normal' training. Cutting performance was assessed based on completion time and COD deficit, and the field-based cutting movement assessment score (CMAS) qualitative screening tool was used to assess cutting movement quality. Significant main effects for time (pre-to-post changes) (p ≤ 0.041, η2 = 0.224-0.839) and significant interaction effects of time and group were observed for cutting completion times, COD deficits, and CMASs. Improvements in completion time (p < 0.001, g = 1.63-1.90, -9% to -11% vs. -5% to 6%) and COD deficit (p ≤ 0.012, g = -1.63 to -2.43, -40-52% vs. -22% to -28%) for the COD intervention group (IG) were approximately two-times greater than the CG. Furthermore, lower CMASs (i.e., improved cutting movement quality) were only observed in the IG (p ≤ 0.025, g = -0.85 to -1.46, -23% to -34% vs. 6-19%) compared to the CG. The positive changes in CMASs were attributed to improved cutting technique and reduced incidences of high-risk deficits such as lateral trunk flexion, extended knee postures, knee valgus, hip internal rotation, and improved braking strategies. The results of this study indicate that COD speed and technique modification training, in addition to normal skills and strength training, improves cutting performance and movement quality in male youth soccer players. Practitioners working with male youth soccer players should implement COD speed and technique modification training to improve cutting performance and movement quality, which may decrease potential injury-risk."

The question arises as to whether each approach has a similar or different effect on endomorphy determination, and whether there is a possibility to estimate the supraspinale skinfold based on other skinfold measurements.A group of 186 male and 161 female students participated in this study. Anthropometric examination included all somatic measurements, as recommended in the Heath-Carter protocol, and the iliac crest skinfold measurement. Estimation of the supraspinale skinfold was performed based on the multiple linear regression procedure.Skinfold thickness measured in the supraspinale and iliac crest differed (p<0.001) in both men (5.41±1.65 mm and 9.55±4.05 mm, respectively) and women (8.87±4.08 mm and 15.20±6.85 mm), respectively. Endomorphy was significantly higher (0.46 in men, 0.63 in women) when the iliac crest skinfold was used. Subscapular skinfold and iliac crest skinfolds were included in the linear regression model for supraspinale skinfold estimation (R2 = 0.724, SE = 0.9 mm and R2 = 0.947, SE = 2.3 mm for men and women, respectively).Two common skinfold approaches produced different measurements between the supraspinale and iliac crest skinfolds, which subsequently affected estimated endomorphy. Regression equations for supraspinale skinfold enabled correction of endomorphy in the case of improperly applied measurement (i.e. iliac crest) and thus, could allow for uniform somatotype estimation according to Carter and Heath approach."

To investigate whether the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is altered in a high-risk population for concussions, we studied professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters and adolescent rugby players. Additionally, we performed the linear regression between the BBB disruption defined by increased gadolinium contrast extravasation on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) on MRI and multiple biomechanical parameters indicating the severity of impacts recorded using instrumented mouthguards in professional MMA fighters. MMA fighters were examined pre-fight for a baseline and again within 120 h post–competitive fight, whereas rugby players were examined pre-season and again post-season or post-match in a subset of cases. DCE-MRI, serological analysis of BBB biomarkers, and an analysis of instrumented mouthguard data, was performed. Here, we provide pilot data that demonstrate disruption of the BBB in both professional MMA fighters and rugby players, dependent on the level of exposure. Our data suggest that biomechanical forces in professional MMA and adolescent rugby can lead to BBB disruption. These changes on imaging may serve as a biomarker of exposure of the brain to repetitive subconcussive forces and mTBI."

Players' movements during the games were measured using a portable local positioning system (LPS) (WIMU PRO®, Realtrack Systems SL, Almería, Spain) and included relative distance (total distance / playing duration), relative distance in established speed zones, high-intensity running (18.1–24.0 km·h-1) and sprinting (> 24.1 km·h-1). player load, peak speed (km·h-1) and peak acceleration (m·s-2) number of total accelerations and total decelerations, high intensity accelerations (> 2 m·s-2) and decelerations (< -2 m·s-2). Results There was an overall decrease in distance covered, player load, number of high intensity accelerations and decelerations between the first and last quarter of the games in all playing positions. A classification tree analysis showed that the first quarter had much influence of distance covered (above 69.0 meters), distance covered <6.0 km·h-1 and accelerations (> 2 m·s-2), whereas the fourth quarter performance had much influence of distance covered (below 69.0) and distance covered 12.1–18.0 km·h-1. Conclusions A significant reduction in physical demands occurs during basketball, especially between first and last quarter for players in all playing positions during basketball games of under 18 elite players."

There are no authoritative guidelines or recommendations for using kettlebells within a primary care setting. Our review objectives were to identify the extent, range and nature of the available evidence, to report on the types of evidence currently available to inform clinical practice, to synthesise key concepts, and identify gaps in the research knowledge base. Following the PRISMA-ScR Checklist, we conducted a search of 10 electronic databases from inception to 1 February 2019. There were no exclusions in searching for publications. A single reviewer screened the literature and abstracted data from relevant publications. Articles were grouped and charted by concepts and themes relevant to primary care, and narratively synthesised. Effect sizes from longitudinal studies were identified or calculated, and randomised controlled trials assessed for methodological quality. Eight hundred and twenty-nine records were identified to 1 February 2019. Four hundred and ninety-six were screened and 170 assessed for eligibility. Ninety-nine publications met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were typically trivial to small. One trial used a pragmatic hardstyle training program among healthy college-age participants. Two trials reported the effects of kettlebell training in clinical conditions. Thirty-three studies explicitly used 'hardstyle' techniques and 4 investigated kettlebell sport. Also included were 6 reviews, 22 clinical/expert opinions and 3 case reports of injury. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies using a modified Downs & Black checklist. A small number of longitudinal studies, which are largely underpowered and of low methodological quality, provide the evidence-informed therapist with little guidance to inform the therapeutic prescription of kettlebells within primary care. Confidence in reported effects is low to very low. The strength of recommendation for kettlebell training improving measures of physical function is weak, based on the current body of literature. Further research on reported effects is warranted, with inclusion of clinical populations and investigations of musculoskeletal conditions common to primary care. There is a need for an externally valid, standardised approach to the training and testing of kettlebell interventions, which better informs the therapeutic use of kettlebells in primary care."

There is still a considerable amount of confusion when it comes to managing concussions. An excessive number of head computed tomographic scans are being obtained for concussions, resulting in unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. Clinicians should be aware of the most recent guidelines for the management of concussion, including the need for imaging, and should be able to differentiate mild from moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.

1. Differentiate a mild from a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

2. Acutely manage a child with a TBI, including deciding when further imaging is necessary.

3. Manage a child with a postconcussion syndrome and identify when referral to a specialist is necessary.

One of the most common injuries in the human knee is the tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The selection of a graft fixation device is an important factor that determines the outcome of an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Before the healing process is completed, the graft is dependent on tibial and femoral fixation devices to maintain normal ACL graft tension. Among various devices, the use of an adjustable loop suspensory fixation device (ALD) in soft-tissue graft reconstruction attracts current interest. An advantage of the ALD is the ability to draw the graft to the depth of the bone tunnel to achieve adequate graft tension while minimizing the empty space in the tunnel. In this study a comprehensive controlled laboratory investigation is performed to examine the biomechanical properties of commonly used cortical fixation devices, with the aim of implementing a standard testing procedure for adjustable loop devices. The procedure consists of three test series, a loop shortening test and two different stability test series (singe device and tendon device test). Those test series are used to compare the performance of a new ALD from Arthrex (Naples, USA) with five competitor devices already on the market. In order to obtain representative results eight samples of each device are tested. In comparison to the previously performed studies, a complete unloading is applied in the stability tests, which allows for a detailed examination of the ALDs locking mechanisms in dynamically loaded test situations. Furthermore, the performed loop shortening tests reveal important aspects, such as the shortening accuracy and settling effects of the loops, that are not found in previous studies. Therefore, the used test protocol can be recommended for further testing."

Sport equipment has a significant effect on how a game is played. Different features of the soccer ball such as its size, structure, weight and potential incoming pressure also affect the nature and quality of the game. Different models of soccer balls have been developed with the aim of increasing game quality and performance. Many scholars have investigated the displacements during typical soccer games caused by the ball impulse and the feet, but few studies have focused on the interaction between the ball and the feet. The aim of the present study is, thus, to investigate tension development and possible deformations caused by kicking the ball. Players who are well aware of soccer rules and have a little knowledge about soccer-induced injuries easily realize that the impulse of a non-standard ball considering its material, size or weight may severely damage the knees or other body parts. Due to the importance of the issue, to evaluate the impact of the soccer ball on the footballer’s feet, two finite element models of typical soccer balls have been studied with respect to the standard features of the real soccer ball in the three layers of leather, thread and rubber. The first model is proportional to the mass of the standard ball and the second incorporates a mass less than the standard level. Two models of bones are used in the present study: a single layer bone and a two-layer bone with cortical and cancellous tissues. For better understanding of the injuries resulting from the impulse from a non-standard ball, the used finite element software employs mechanic laws of sport biomechanics to provide better understanding of the details using mathematical modeling, computer simulation and experimental measurements. In this regard, this significant point is achieved through modeling the ball impulse to the feet which is quite complex and needs some simplification. As the soccer ball is flexible, most of the force is absorbed by the model’s flexibility. In the other model with a less flexible ball, the force absorbed by the bone is significantly more."

Methods: Between 2013 and 2014, the outcomes of 20 soccer players undergoing ACL reconstruction using bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft infiltrated with ADRC at the end of the procedure were compared to a historical, matched cohort of 19 soccer players undergoing the same procedure without ADRC. Outcomes were obtained at baseline, and 6 and 12 months postop for IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee), Lysholm, and Lequesne, and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months postop for VAS (visual analogue scale) for pain and graft maturation to evaluate the ligamentization process (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based). Results: Both groups significantly improved the IKDC ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups), Lysholm ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups), Lequesne index ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups), VAS for pain ( p = 0.002 for the ADRC and p &lt; 0.001 for the control group), and MRI scores ( p &lt; 0.001 in both groups) in the 12 months postop compared to baseline scores. However, there were no significant differences in the improvement of the outcomes between groups across time ( p &gt; 0.05). All patients returned to sports after surgery, but 8 (40%) patients in the ADRC and 13 (68.4%) patients in the control group had lower Tegner activity score at 12 months postop. Conclusions: Patients receiving ADRC at the time of ACL reconstruction significantly improved knee function and healing/maturation of the graft at 12 months. However, this improvement was not statistically significant compared to a control group undergoing ACL reconstruction alone."

Nine elite and nine non-elite swimmers swam a 50-m front-crawl sprint wearing a 3D accelerometer on their back between the inferior angles of the scapulae. Lap times and JC were calculated from the acceleration signal and compared between groups and between swimmers within a group. The elite swimmers swam significantly faster lap times than the non-elite swimmers (p < 0.001). They did so with significantly lower levels of JC compared to the non-elite swimmers (p = 0.005). Furthermore, a stepwise multiple linear regression showed JC accounted for 32.9% of the variation in lap time of the elite swimmers. These results indicate that it is possible to discriminate elite from non-elite swimmers using JC: elite swimmers swim with lower JCs than non-elite swimmers. Additionally, swimming at higher speed is associated with more accelerations and decelerations in both elite and non-elite swimmers, which is reflected by higher JCs and lower smoothness. In sum, JC provides an index of swimming technique that is easy to use in training practice."

To better understand individual-specific factors that may explain variation in head impact biomechanics, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between physical performance measures and HIE metrics in youth football players. Methods Head impact data were collected from youth football players using the Head Impact Telemetry System. Head impact exposure was quantified in terms of impact frequency, linear and rotational head acceleration, and risk-weighted cumulative exposure metrics (RWE Linear , RWE Rotational , and RWE CP ). Study participants completed four physical performance tests: vertical jump, shuttle run, three-cone, and 40-yard sprint. The relationships between performance measures, and HIE metrics were evaluated using linear regression analyses. Results A total of 51 youth football athletes (ages, 9–13 yr) completed performance testing and received combined 13,770 head impacts measured with the Head Impact Telemetry System for a full season. All performance measures were significantly correlated with total number of impacts in a season, RWE Linear -Season, and all RWE-Game metrics. The strongest relationships were between 40-yard sprint speed and all RWE-Game metrics (all P ≤ 0.0001 and partial R 2 &gt; 0.3). The only significant relationships among HIE metrics in practice were between shuttle run speed and total practice impacts and RWE Linear -Practices, 40 yard sprint speed and total number of practice impacts, and three-cone speed and 95th percentile number of impacts/practice. Conclusions Generally, higher vertical jump height and faster times in speed and agility drills were associated with higher HIE, especially in games. Physical performance explained less variation in HIE in practices, where drills and other factors, such as coaching style, may have a larger influence on HIE."

The shoulder is the most commonly injured area of the body among kayaking participants as a result of acute traumatic events and chronic overuse injuries. Therefore, kayaking participants may often seek advice for shoulder problems and there is a scarcity of studies regarding shoulder injuries in this population. In this case report, we present a young male recreational whitewater kayaker with a severe suprascapular nerve (SSN) entrapment who presented with shoulder pain and inability to perform his sport. He was initially evaluated elsewhere and was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy for presumptive diagnosis of subacromial impingement. After 5 months of failed non-operative treatment, the patient sought a second opinion with our group. SSN entrapment diagnosis was confirmed by a thorough careful physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging and electrodiagnostic study. Given the failure of non-operative treatment, the patient was treated with arthroscopic SSN decompression and successfully returned to kayaking without symptoms. While SSN entrapment has been reported in a variety of sports, especially those involving overhead movements, this is the first case report of SSN entrapment reported which impaired participation in kayaking. This case report supports the consideration of SSN entrapment in the differential diagnosis of painful shoulder among kayaking participants and highlights the importance of undressing the patient and examining the posterior shoulder for atrophy, winging or deformity."

For seaweed aquaculture to be successful in newly emerging industry in Europe and other Western countries, it will have to develop sustainable production management strategies. A key feature in this process is the capacity to conserve genetic diversity for breeding programs aimed at developing seed stock for onward cultivation, as well as in the management of wild populations, as potentially interesting genetic resources are predicted to disappear due to climate change. In this study, the cryopreservation of male and female gametophytes (haploid life stage) of S. latissima by different combinations of two-step cooling methods and cryoprotectants was explored. We report here that cryopreservation constitutes an attractive option for the long-term preservation of S. latissima gametophytes, with viable cells in all treatment combinations. The highest viabilities for both male and female gametophytes were found using controlled-rate cooling methods combined with dimethyl sulfoxide 10% (v/v). Morphological normal sporophytes were observed to develop from cryopreserved vegetative gametophytic cells, independent of treatment. This indicates that cryopreservation is a useful preservation method for male and female S. latissima gametophytes."

Eleven young highly-trained female ice hockey players performed two 40-m skating sprints on two separate days to evaluate inter-trial and test-retest reliability. The velocity-time data recorded by a radar device was used to calculate the kinetics variables of the skating sprint acceleration: maximal theoretical force (F0), maximal theoretical velocity (V0), maximal theoretical power (Pmax) and the slope of the linear force-velocity relationship (SFV). SFV and SFVrel variables (the slope of the linear relationship between horizontal force relative to body mass and velocity) demonstrated 'low' to 'moderate' intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). All other variables revealed 'acceptable' inter-trial and test-retest reliability (ICC ≥ 0.75 and coefficient of variation [CV] ≤ 10%). Furthermore, test-retest reliability (ICC and CV) and sensitivity [Standard Error of Measurement (SEMs) ≤ Small Worthwhile Change (SWCs)] were higher when averaging the two trials compared to the best trial (40-m split time) only. These findings offer a promising and simple method to monitor training-induced changes in macroscopic mechanical variables of ice hockey skating performance."

This injury requires a long recovery process, with no guarantee of returning to the pre-injury level. When a rupture happens during natural life, movement analysis can provide useful insights concerning patterns of rupture to understand and prevent Achilles tendon injuries. Here we determined the pattern of rupture of an Achilles tendon (AT) in an elite high-jumper athlete who ruptured an AT during the straight line running phase in preparation for a high-jump attempt. This study is a novel case report regarding a national-level elite athlete. The main outcomes were kinematics parameters obtained from video analysis. The pattern of the rupture was determined by pixel intensity and outlier analysis. The rupture occurred at 44% of the single stance. The injured leg showed a higher ankle dorsal flexion and knee-ankle ratio, and a lower knee flexion compared to contralateral leg. An eccentric pattern of rupture occurred during the transition from the mid to terminal stance phases of running. The lower knee flexion and the increased ankle dorsal flexion during the stance suggest a loss of knee-ankle coordination. This might have favoured a major elongation of Achilles tendon causing the rupture."

Specifically, we sought to understand whether the simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual patterns could usefully direct the learner's attention from goal to pattern stimuli. I selected 40 students (Mage = 20.47 years) who had no prior experience with the basketball jump shot or free throw and randomly assigned them into four groups: Pattern/Visual, Pattern/Audio-Visual, Pattern-Goal/Visual, and Pattern-Goal/Audio-Visual. Participants in the pattern-only groups watched only the skilled motor pattern, while those in the pattern-goal groups watched both the pattern and its outcome. Participants in the visual-only groups simply watched the visual pattern, while those in audio-visual groups saw and heard the pattern; we sonified the angular velocity of the skilled performer's elbow joint. Participants then performed in two conditions with and without balls. On all dependent variables, the participants' performance following the audio-visual presentations was better than when following the visual-only presentations. In addition, the participants' performance in pattern-only groups was better than in pattern-goal groups, but this improved pattern-only performance was far less extensive in the audio-visual than in the visual-only group. In sum, complex motor skill imitation was enhanced by an audio pattern of elbow angular velocity in support of generalist theories of imitation learning."

The retreat brought together clinicians and researchers to present and discuss research advances in ACL injury risk, outcomes, and prevention. Prior retreats (2001–2012)1–6 largely focused on advances in primary injury risk-factor identification and prevention (ie, preventing the initial trauma). Despite our improved understanding of ACL injury risk and the success of primary prevention efforts, ACL injuries continue to occur and lead to short-term and long-term consequences that have substantial effects on joint health and quality of life for years to come. To address these additional challenges, the ACL Research Retreat expanded in scope to include secondary ACL injury risk and prevention in 20157 and the short-term and long-term sequelae of early-onset osteoarthritis that results from the initial trauma (herein, posttraumatic osteoarthritis or PTOA) in 2019. The ACL Research Retreat VIII therefore considered ACL injury risk and prevention along a continuum that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary risk identification and prevention strategies as described by Palmieri-Smith et al (Table 1).8To illustrate this continuum, consider a soccer team comprising 13-year-old girls. We know the ACL injury risk increases dramatically from ages 13 to 16,9–11 such that girls have a 2 to 4 times greater risk than similarly trained males.12,13 Thus, our first goal for this age group, especially among maturing girls, is to prevent the initial trauma from occurring (ie, primary prevention). We pursue injury risk reduction by leveraging 2½ decades of research to screen for known risk factors and deliver evidence-based neuromuscular-training programs to reduce the ACL injury risk. Despite these interventions, 1 or more of these active, young girls may still go on to sustain an ACL injury, which has both short-term and long-term secondary consequences. In the short term (first year after injury), we know that 50% of injured athletes do not return to their prior levels of sport.14 Of the young athletic patients who do return to high-risk sport, nearly 1 in 4 will sustain another ACL injury, often within the first few months of their return.15–19 Therefore, once an injury has occurred, our goals are to deliver therapeutic interventions to optimally restore joint function and reduce that individual's potential for experiencing a second ACL injury while at the same time preventing further joint damage (ie, secondary prevention). This includes intervening in both the primary risk factors that contributed to the initial injury (assuming they are still present) and the neuromechanical deficits that resulted from the injury. This also includes establishing evidence-based biopsychosocial benchmarks to safely return the athlete to sport. Still, more than 30% of these athletes have been reported20 to develop early evidence of PTOA within 10 years of the initial injury, which has the potential to significantly alter joint function and quality of life. Long-term prevention strategies are therefore geared at identifying the factors that hasten the development and progression of PTOA and developing appropriate therapeutic interventions to delay or mitigate these complications (ie, tertiary prevention).The ACL Research Retreat VIII featured 3 keynote presentations and 32 peer-reviewed abstract presentations highlighting advances in risk identification and prevention strategies across the ACL injury continuum. Keynote speakers presented cutting-edge research on ACL injury biomechanics and the motions that elevate in vivo ACL strains during dynamic activities that place individuals at high risk for ACL injury (Louis DeFrate, ScD, Duke University, Durham, NC), innovative augmented neuromuscular-training approaches to more effectively reduce the biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury (Gregory Myer, PhD, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH), and the identification of early markers of PTOA and directions for therapeutic interventions to prevent joint degeneration and promote joint rejuvenation earlier in the clinical course after ACL injury (Constance Chu, MD, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, CA). Free communication sessions were organized around the themes of primary risk identification (ACL morphology and brain contributions) and intervention strategies, secondary risk identification and prevention (neuromechanical deficiencies and return-to-play considerations after ACL reconstruction [ACLR]), and tertiary risk identification and prevention (chronic sequelae of PTOA progression). Substantial time was provided for group discussion to summarize the recent advances and emerging trends from each thematic session and identify strategic initiatives for future research. We then considered risk factors that were common targets across primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts and the potential for developing a collaborative, multicenter ACL injury research network that could span the time course of ACL injury from primary injury prevention to the secondary and tertiary prevention of PTOA after injury. The summary of these discussions follows. We also present the summaries21,22 of 2 keynotes and the research abstracts23 on which these discussions were based. (Note: As Dr DeFrate's keynote focused primarily on recently completed yet unpublished data, a written summary is not included. Please watch for forthcoming publications from his work.)It is widely accepted that multifactorial mechanisms contribute to the risk of primary ACL injury. Much of the discussion during the meeting centered on the concept that at-risk biomechanics known to strain the ACL could be considered an intersection of overlapping contributions from anatomic/structural, biological, neurologic, and psychosocial factors. These at-risk biomechanics have been correlated with joint actions ascertained from modeled and direct ACL-loading biomechanics,24–32 video observation of actual injury events,33–36 and prospective ACL injury risk-factor studies.37,38 The mechanistic studies presented by Dr DeFrate indicated that a relatively extended knee at foot contact may be a high-risk position due to the relatively larger ACL strain values in this position.39–41Research on primary risk assessment presented at the ACL Research Retreat VIII focused on structural and neurologic risk factors. This summary is therefore limited to those areas. The reader is referred to the 2015 ACL Research Retreat VII consensus statement7 for an in-depth discussion of risk assessment, as much of the important knowns and directions for future research remain relevant today.Greater anterior knee laxity42–51 and greater body mass index (BMI)11,49,51–53 are well-documented risk factors that are substantially more predictive of ACL injury risk when both are accounted for relative to a univariate modeling of risk.49,51 Females develop greater anterior knee laxity54–56 and BMI (representing more fat mass relative to total body mass)57–60 as they mature, and these maturational changes coincide with their disproportional rise in ACL injury risk compared with males.9,11,61 At the last retreat,7 it was suggested that greater magnitudes of knee laxity may have both biological and biomechanical consequences. Research presented there indicated that clinical measures of anterior knee laxity may provide insights into the structural size and quality of the ACL (Wang et al abstract #1, Shultz et al abstract #2).23 Greater absolute anterior knee laxity was related to the in vivo combination of smaller ligament size and intrinsic structural characteristics (larger T2* relaxation times) of the ligament (Wang et al abstract #1). When examining the magnitude of change in knee laxity across the menstrual cycle and during exercise (which were strongly correlated), investigators found that smaller and less organized ACLs (larger T2* relaxation times) were associated with a smaller magnitude of change in laxity and a smaller magnitude of change tended to be associated with a greater baseline value (Shultz et al abstract #2).Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxation mapping has been primarily validated for articular cartilage tissue.62–64 In addition to the research presented at ACL Research Retreat VIII, including the use of novel MRI ultrashort echo time T2* to evaluate healing ACL grafts,21,65 T2* relaxation has been used to study animal ACL grafts66,67 and has been negatively associated with the yield load of healing ACL grafts.66 Additionally, these imaging sequences have been used to evaluate the structural characteristics of the Achilles68 and patellar69 tendons. The ability to noninvasively assess ligamentous structural characteristics via a clinical measure such as knee laxity may help us to better understand and identify the risk of injury in clinical settings.Further insights into BMI as a primary risk factor were not discussed. However, BMI was addressed relative to secondary prevention and the development of PTOA (see later sections).Central neurologic factors represent a rapidly emerging area of ACL injury risk assessment. Adding to published work,70–77 data presented at the retreat further suggest neurophysiological contributions to ACL injury (Diekfuss et al abstract #5, Bonnette et al abstract #6) and recovery (Lepley et al abstract #14); however, our understanding of both areas remains limited. As discussed at ACL Research Retreat VII by Buz Swanik, PhD, ATC,77 a noncontact ACL injury event can be conceptualized as a sequence of neural-activity errors that results in an inability to maintain joint stability. Neuroimaging studies presented at ACL Research Retreat VIII further indicate a potentially direct association between alterations in neural activity or connectivity and high-risk biomechanics and ACL injury risk (or a combination of these). Specifically, individuals classified as high risk (≥21.74-Nm knee-abduction moment [KAM]) versus low risk (≤10.6-Nm KAM) during 3-dimensional motion analysis of a double-legged landing displayed increased sensorimotor neural activity during neuroimaging of a simulated landing (similar hip and knee ranges of motion as in the laboratory-based landing but supine in the MRI scanner; Criss et al abstract #3). Additionally, high-risk individuals exhibited decreased neural activity in the cingulate gyrus (attention) and parietal cortex (sensory processing) during a single-legged knee-repositioning task and increased brain activity of the frontal cortex (cognition) during a single-legged knee force-attenuation task (Grooms et al abstract #4). These alterations in activity suggest a manifestation of maladapted spatial awareness and attention to knee motor control that may contribute to a decreased ability to control frontal-plane loading during landing. Decreased activity in the sensory and attentional regions and increased activity in the cognitive and motor regions to control knee-joint position and force during a simulated landing task in those at high risk for injury may indicate a rapid saturation of motor-coordination capacity. Specifically, dynamic maneuvers with high environmental-navigation or spatial-processing demands may lead to a deterioration in neuromuscular coordination that results in high KAMs.Prospective neuroimaging risk factors were also presented at the retreat. Among female athletes compared with control participants, individuals who went on to experience an ACL injury exhibited less electroencephalography (EEG) power in the θ and α-2 frequency bands, findings that are thought to be associated with decreased attentional and sensorimotor electrocortical functioning (Bonnette et al abstract #6). As the ACL injury typically occurs from rapid and high loading forces, any deficit or delay in sensory or attentional processing may contribute to an inability to correct potential sensorimotor-coordination errors, resulting in knee positions that increase the ACL injury risk.78 Also, in male athletes, using baseline resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), individuals who went on to sustain an ACL injury displayed decreased connectivity between multiple sensorimotor regions compared with uninjured control participants (Diekfuss et al abstract #5). Together, these findings indicate that the underlying neural processes related to sensorimotor control may play a role in ACL injury risk and that the neural contributions to injury risk may be sex dependent.Collectively, this emerging area of research implicates a cognitive-motor as opposed to a sensory-motor neural-activation strategy in those with an elevated injury risk. More research is needed to determine if these processes contribute to an inability to manage unanticipated events or visual-spatial challenges and subsequently generate sufficient muscle stiffening to avoid injury.Several high-quality meta-analyses89–94 indicated that the ACL injury incidence was reduced with neuromuscular-training programs. In female athletes, these programs resulted in a decrease of half of all ACL injuries and two-thirds of noncontact ACL injuries.90 Successful programs incorporated progressive landing-stabilization exercises that focus on proper knee alignment and soft landings in addition to exercises targeting the hip and hamstrings musculature. Neuromuscular-training programs implemented before the sport season and continued through the season appeared to be more effective in reducing the risk of ACL injury. Additionally, these programs should be implemented early in middle school– and high school–aged athletes.89The structured discussion at the ACL Research Retreat VIII highlighted the current state of knowledge about the success of neuromuscular-training programs and the use of promising new technologies (eg, virtual and augmented reality, real-time biofeedback, and wearable sensors).95,96 The consensus was that externally focused biofeedback techniques, which engage implicit motor-learning mechanisms, are advantageous for sensorimotor adaptation.97–101 MacPherson et al (abstract #19) presented preliminary data on the effects of delivering augmented biofeedback to female athletes. This intervention not only demonstrated increased sensorimotor-related brain activation for knee motor control (using fMRI) but the observed neural adaptations were also strongly correlated with safer landing biomechanics assessed using 3-dimensional motion analyses. Additionally, preliminary data on augmented biofeedback indicated that it may induce adaptive neuroplasticity, thereby increasing the retention and transfer of those movement patterns to sport.102 These early data highlight the utility of real-time biofeedback systems for sensorimotor adaptation that could eventually be personalized to target individual movement deficiencies. The previous consensus statement7 highlighted the need for future work in this area, and several National Institutes of Health–funded randomized controlled trials95,96 currently being performed will likely inform future programs.The majority of individuals who sustain an ACL injury and undergo ACLR and traditional rehabilitation return to some level of physical activity.107 However, as previously noted, 50% of those who tear their ACLs do not return to their prior competitive level of sport.14 Of the young athletes (<25 years old) who do return to sport, 1 in 4 are likely to experience a second ACL injury,19 and many of these injuries occur within 24 months of returning to sport.108–110 The risk of secondary injury is of particular concern for adolescent girls, who are 2 to 4 times more likely than adolescent boys or older age groups to sustain a second ACL injury15–18 and subsequently experience poorer health outcomes.111,112 Thus, secondary prevention efforts are critically needed.Even more debilitating than the ACL injury itself are the initiation and accelerated rate of progression of PTOA that are frequently observed after injury,20,113 which further compound patient-reported disability and reduced performance in activities of daily living.114 Among young and physically active populations, roughly 50% of ACL injuries progress to radiographic PTOA within 12 years; similar findings have been reported for meniscal tears.115,116 Effective surgical interventions are available to repair these injuries and restore short-term function and mobility to preinjury performance levels, but surgical repair does not prevent the early development and rapid progression of PTOA in the knee joint.117 Furthermore, significant deficits in patient-reported outcomes,118 neuromuscular function,119 biomechanical movement patterns,120 and psychosocial factors121,122 have been noted even after patients have undergone ACLR and completed a full course of therapy.A new focus at ACL Research Retreat VIII was on how ACL injury affects short-term and long-term joint health, with the goal of mitigating the risk of secondary injury and PTOA. Traditionally, the management of ACL injuries has ended when athletes are deemed fit to return to participation. Treatment has focused on restoring anatomic structures and initial functional capabilities through surgical repair and rehabilitation; patients with uncomplicated courses are typically discharged from follow-up care 6 to 9 months after surgery. However, it is clear from previous evidence that these traditional approaches to ACLR surgery, rehabilitation, and return to play do not adequately reduce the risk of subsequent injury109,123 or the development of PTOA.20 Therefore, ACL injuries are the starting point for impaired joint function and a cascade of progressive degenerative joint changes in the knee that lead to altered function and chronic pain and result in physical limitations affecting both performance and activities of daily living.8,124 The interplay among biomechanical, structural, neuromuscular, and biological changes after ACL injury and surgical reconstruction likely contributes to the development of PTOA.125 Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the development of persistent symptoms, impaired joint function, and biochemical changes within the joint is paramount to identifying novel therapeutic targets to improve short-term and long-term patient outcomes after ACLR.The ACL Research Retreat VIII featured abstract presentations that highlighted a multifaceted range of factors that alter neuromuscular function, joint-loading patterns, and movement biomechanics after ACLR, including ACL grafting techniques.The quadriceps tendon is an increasingly popular autograft type that showed similar interlimb symmetry in loading during jump landing as the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (Hunnicutt et al abstract #8). It also displayed similar interlimb symmetry as the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in quadriceps strength, size, and activation, as well as hop distance and patient-reported outcomes.126 However, biomechanical modeling work (Domire et al abstract #7) suggested that alterations in the semitendinosus attachment site after the tendon was used for an ACL graft may result in alterations to the moment arm of the semitendinosus. This raises the question of whether some of the differences observed in movement mechanics after ACLR result from the change in moment arm of the lower extremity muscles as a result of the surgical reconstruction.The inability to contract the quadriceps is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism linking ACL injury and ACLR to aberrant movement biomechanics after injury and surgery,119 which may increase the risk of a second ACL injury or the development of PTOA. Quadriceps weakness in individuals who have undergone ACLR is associated with worse patient-reported function127,128 as well as deleterious changes in joint structure and129 cartilage composition.130Extensive discussion at the retreat addressed the neural and morphologic mechanisms associated with muscular changes after ACL injury and ACLR. A neural-morphologic link between changes in spinal reflexive and cortical excitability and changes in muscle structure together influenced persistent muscle weakness after ACLR (Lepley et al abstract #14). In addition to reduced muscle volume, novel diffusion tensor MRI methods demonstrated an increased muscle-fiber angle in the vastus medialis after ACLR compared with the uninjured limb (Lepley et al abstract #13). Other, more clinically applicable imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography, were also used to assess altered muscle quality after ACLR (Johnston et al abstract #17). We still poorly understand the factors associated with optimal treatments to reverse the multifaceted neuromuscular sequelae of ACL injury and ACLR. Also, whether strengthening the quadriceps results in beneficial changes to movement biomechanics remains uncertain. Although quadriceps weakness may result in immediate changes in gait,131 improving quadriceps strength does not necessarily alter gait biomechanics in patients after ACLR132 or with knee osteoarthritis (OA).133,134 This was further supported by Krysak et al (abstract #18), who found that a plyometric intervention improved quadriceps strength limb symmetry without subsequent changes in hop movement among individuals after ACLR. In addition, these results showed that integrative motor-learning and muscle-strengthening approaches are warranted to restore holistic sensorimotor capabilities after injury.Aberrant lower extremity joint loading is commonly observed after ACLR.135 Evidence suggested that either excessive136 or insufficient loading137,138 of joint tissues may lead to joint injury or hasten the progression of PTOA. Greater loading of the ACLR limb has been demonstrated during gait compared with the contralateral limb139 and the limbs of uninjured control participants.140 Conversely, others have observed less loading of the ACLR limb during gait, and this reduced loading was associated with greater biochemical markers of inflammation141 and cartilage breakdown,142 altered cartilage composition,143 worse patient-reported outcomes,144 thinner tibiofemoral cartilage,145 and radiographic knee OA 5 years after ACLR.146 The mechanisms leading to abnormal amounts of more or less loading during gait after ACLR are not clear, but data presented at the retreat helped to shed light on potential mechanisms and stimulate directions for future research.Preliminary data provided at the retreat demonstrated an association between greater femoral articular cartilage T1ρ MRI relaxation times (ie, interpreted as worse proteoglycan density) and greater peak vertical ground reaction force as well as smaller quadriceps-related knee moments in individuals with ACLR during a jump landing (Pfeiffer et al abstract #30). These data support the hypothesis that excessive tibiofemoral loading may be minimized after ACLR in individuals who maximize quadriceps-related moments during dynamic movements. Other investigators found that poorer proprioception was associated with less loading during gait, suggesting that offloading of the ACLR limb may be correlated with altered somatosensory function in the lower extremity (Blackburn et al abstract #29). These seemingly conflicting findings may point to complex associations among muscle function, joint loading, and deleterious joint tissue changes after ACLR. Not understanding this interplay was considered a major gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms causing PTOA after ACLR. Unfortunately, this critical knowledge gap impairs the development of optimal evidence-based load-management guidelines for maximizing long-term joint health after ACLR.Aberrant walking-gait biomechanics are common in individuals with ACLR135,147,148 and are likely to be highly influential in PTOA development.149 A stiffened-knee strategy, characterized by a more extended knee and a smaller quadriceps-related moment through stance, is common after ACLR and may result in impaired energy attenuation in tissues about the knee.150,151 Preliminary evidence from the retreat showed that individuals with weaker quadriceps (ie, <3.0 Nm/kg of body mass) displayed more extended knees throughout stance and smaller moments and greater vertical ground reaction force in the first 20% of stance than individuals who met strength cutoffs (ie, >3.0 Nm/kg of body mass; Pietrosimone et al abstract #11). Minimizing strength loss after ACL injury and ACLR was associated with gait strategies that may mitigate the risk of PTOA development.Additionally, individuals with a greater BMI demonstrated differences in gait biomechanics compared with those who had a normal BMI.152 Greater BMI (associated with greater fat mass relative to total body mass) and obesity have been strongly implicated in the risk of primary ACL injury11,49,51,52 and the development of OA.153 Individuals with ACLR who were overweight or obese had greater peak knee-adduction moments and vertical ground reaction force (normalized to total body mass) than uninjured individuals who were overweight or obese (Pamukoff et al abstract #10). The influence of obesity on gait biomechanics may be further affected by sex (Davis-Wilson abstract #9).Functional assessments were discussed as critical components for improving return-to-play decision making after ACLR. New data indicated that individuals who achieved 90% interlimb symmetry during a triple-hop-for-distance test exhibited asymmetric lower extremity joint work and power outcomes, suggesting that movement strategies to achieve symmetric hop distances may differ between limbs (White et al abstract #26). Further data are needed to determine if asymmetric movement strategies in the presence of symmetric hop distances influence the risk of reinjury on return to sport.Current return-to-participation or return-to-sport criteria have focused on minimizing the risk of subsequent ACL injury,154 yet previously published criteria did not specifically address the risk of PTOA development. We need to collect patient-reported outcomes after ACLR to identify individuals who may need additional psychological support. Specifically, individuals with ACLR who reported greater fear of reinjury also described greater physical and psychological barriers to returning to sport (Burland et al abstract #24). Additionally, a novel case study integrated the measurement of movement quality and monitoring of external load in an adolescent female soccer player (Taylor et al abstract #25). The authors highlighted the clinical feasibility of measuring both the quality and quantity of movement to make more informed clinical decisions regarding whether athletes are ready to meet the demands of sport. Fluid biochemical analyses (Trump et al abstract #32) and MRI markers of cartilage morphology and composition155 may allow the early detection of deleterious changes to joint tissues. However, these techniques are expensive, technically demanding, generally investigational, and inaccessible to many clinicians. Measures such as habitual walking speed,156,157 quadriceps strength (normalized to total body mass),128 and patient-reported outcomes158 show promise as clinically relevant measures associated with early changes in joint tissue health after ACLR.Mounting evidence suggests that the progression to PTOA is influenced by the interplay between aberrant joint biomechanics and altered joint tissue metabolism after injury.126,159–162 Work reflecting more than a decade of longitudinal study21,163 of ACL-injured patients at the University of Pittsburgh and Stanford University presented by keynote speaker Constance Chu, MD, showed that approximately half of patients had quantitative MRI ultrashort echo time-T2*, mechanical, or biological markers indicating a higher OA risk just 2 years after ACLR. Several researchers sought to characterize the effects of early structural, biomechanical, and biological changes after ACL injury and their association with important outcomes related to joint health status over time (Blackburn abstract #29, Pfeiffer abstract #30, Wallace abstract #31, and Trump abstract #32). Characterizing how these changes are related to long-term joint health status and outcomes is of critical importance to the secondary and tertiary prevention of PTOA after ACL injury and may facilitate emerging models of care that are focused on preserving joint health and mitigating the risk of PTOA.8,164,165Historically, our understanding of neuromuscular function after ACLR has been limited to gross measures of quadriceps strength recovery, neglecting the intricate relationships between the neural and morphologic environments that interact to produce force and maintain muscle health. However, recent advances in technologies, such as fMRI for neural activity and improved MRI for quantifying muscle quality and cartilage health, have been successfully implemented and led to key observations about poor long-term neuromuscular recoveries that degrade joint health. From a neural perspective, we have seen that those with ACL injury displayed increased cognitive and visuospatial proprioception-related neural activity and altered cortical motor excitability throughout recovery.74–76 This altered neurocognitive scheme directly impairs sensorimotor neural efficiency, which in turn degrades physical function and performance.77,102,166 New data presented at the retreat focused on muscle health and neuromuscular control; these continue to be dysregulated long after the traditional ACLR rehabilitation period has ended. Notably, these studies provided evidence for markers of greater muscle fat accumulation after ACLR in concert with a fibrotic extracellular matrix (Johnston et al abstract #17), altered muscle phenotyping (Lepley et al abstract #14), changes in muscle-fiber angle (Lepley et al abstract #13), and dynamic muscle function (Davi et al abstract #16). From a biomechanical viewpoint, a hazardous link between neuromuscular-control strategies and long-term joint health was reported, whereby inadequate knee somatosensory recovery during gait (Blackburn et al abstract #29) and altered interlimb jump-landing strategies (Pfeiffer et al abstract #30) after ACLR were linked with factors associated with PTOA risk. To date, our observations of these disruptions in neural efficiency, protracted morphologic abnormalities, and biomechanical dysfunction are limited to cross-sectional studies and small-scale preoperative-to-postoperative ACLR cohorts. To better inform clinical practice, future prospective cohort studies are needed to identify the timing of these neuromuscular changes across the ACLR rehabilitation continuum and determine whether interventions can alter the deleterious outcomes that have long-term effects on neuromuscular function and joint health.Early structural and biomechanical changes observed after ACL injury and surgical reconstruction may also be associated with changes in molecular biomarkers of cartilage collagen turnover and joint health status after injury.167–169 New data presented at the retreat suggested that significant differences were present in the ratio of type II collagen degradation (C1, 2C, and C2C) to synthesis (CPII) within 15 days of injury (Trump et al abstract #32) between patients with ACL injuries and uninjured control participants. Furthermore, these ratios continued to decrease at the time of surgery and 6 months after surgery in patients with ACL injuries but did not change in uninjured control participants. These decreases were primarily driven by an increase in serum CPII concentration, which indicates that cartilage collagen turnover may be dysregulated early after ACL injury. This finding is consistent with the emerging literature in this area168; however, the implications for long-term joint health and the risk of PTOA remain unclear.The following priorities for research in this area were discussed.Participants also engaged in a discussion (led by Kenneth L. Cameron, PhD, MPH, ATC) about the potential for establishing a collaborative, multicenter ACL injury research network. With an added focus on early deficits after ACL injury and the long-term consequences of ACL injury at this year's meeting, attendees discussed opportunities for establishing a collaborative ACL injury research network that could span the time course of ACL injury from primary injury prevention to secondary and tertiary prevention of PTOA after injury. Many studies of ACL injury risk factors and outcomes have been cross-sectional or retrospective in design, involved small samples, applied disparate methods, and produced conflicting results. These factors make it challenging to answer important questions and limit the ability of researchers and clinicians to interpret the findings. The goal of a collaborative, multicenter research network would be to address some of these existing limitations. The ongoing interest in the ACL Research Retreat and other such meetings suggests that such a need and interest exist, and this was further reinforced by the postmeeting survey, which indicated that all respondents (N = 31) were in favor of such a network, and 84% of respondents had a strong interest in participating. A brief overview of that discussion follows, with the identified critical steps and barriers to forming a collaborative, multicenter research network in this area.Initially, the discussion focused on existing multicenter research groups, how they are structured, lessons learned from these groups, and existing gaps that are not currently being addressed. Multicenter research networks include the National Collegiate Athletic Association-Department of Defense (NCAA-DoD) Grand Alliance Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium174; the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON)175; the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS)176; and the Military Orthopaedics Tracking Injuries and Outcomes Network (MOTION).177 Most closely aligned with the goal of developing a collaborative multicenter ACL injury research network were the MOON and MARS groups, which are primarily focused on patient-reported and surgical outcomes after primary ACL reconstruction and revision surgery, respectively. However, primary injury-prevention efforts, physical function after rehabilitation, and return to participation and full activity have received little attention from these groups.175 The simultaneous collections of patient-reported outcomes, quantitative MRI results, and mechanical and biochemical markers as performed for the Stanford University prospective ACLR cohort,178,179 while challenging, were considered highly important to understanding PTOA development. The current knowledge gaps that could be addressed by a collaborative, multicenter ACL injury research network are described in Table 2.Next, the group addressed the critical first steps to establishing a network, including practical considerations such as interest in participating, the feasibility of collaborative, multicenter research (including potential barriers and strategies to overcome), and the potential for funding support. Considerations for research network structure, organization, leadership, and function included the potential role of study cores (eg, biomechanics, imaging, neuromotor function, biospecimens), special interest groups (eg, return-to-participation criteria and outcomes), and implications for data sharing and dissemination.Finally, the group discussed possible common data elements across primary, secondary, and tertiary risk and prevention that could be collected as part of this network (Table 3). Clinical measures that could be readily obtained by all network participants are followed in the list by biomarkers requiring specialized equipment or technical training (or both). This compilation is intended to provide a starting point for further discussion of the primary data elements to be collected. Although examples of specific measures are provided in some cases, the actual measures would ultimately be determined by network members based on the best available evidence that continues to emerge, feasibility, and acceptable multicenter measurement consistency and precision. In some areas, further research may be required to determine specific measures. For example, it is increasingly apparent that psychosocial factors are extremely important, but few researchers have examined these factors in relation to ACL injury risk and outcomes after injury and surgery.Ideally, network participants would begin to collect these measures before injury (preinjury baseline) to separate preexisting risk factors from those resulting from the injury. Postinjury visits should then include time of injury; time of surgery; 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-ups; and time of return to activity to determine how these variables changed over time after injury, how the patients responded to therapeutic interventions, how clinicians assessed safe return to play, and how the various factors were associated with initiation and progression of PTOA and changes in joint health over time. As much as possible, these postinjury visits should be aligned with medical visits to enhance feasibility and reduce the participant burden. For those measures that change over time (eg, hormones, laxity, BMI, strength), consideration should be given to assessing these relative to maturational status and, in menstruating females, relative to cycle phase.Advances in research continue to shape what we know about the ACL injury continuum and the important directions for future research that are needed to move the field forward. Our expectation is that these proceedings will continue to stimulate strategic research initiatives to more effectively identify those at risk and promote high-quality clinical interventions to prevent the initial injury from occurring and to improve both the short-term and long-term patient outcomes when ACL injury does occur.We thank the following for their support of the meeting: North Carolina Biotechnology Center (Research Triangle Park, NC), Biodex Medical Systems, Inc (Shirley, NY), the MotionMonitor (Chicago, IL), and Qualisys Motion Capture Systems (Gothenberg, Sweden).

https://openalex.org/W2972672959,"Isokinetic Strength of Rotators, Flexors and Hip Extensors is Strongly Related to Front Kick Dynamics in Military Professionals",2019-08-21,2019,article,"Abstract Achieving the maximum possible impact force of the front kick can be related to the isokinetic lower limb muscle strength. Therefore, we aimed to determine the regression model between kicking performance and the isokinetic peak net moment of hip rotators, flexors, and hip extensors and flexors at various speeds of contraction. Twenty-five male soldiers (27.7 ± 7.2 yrs, 83.8 ± 6.1 kg, 180.5 ± 6.5 cm) performed six barefoot front kicks, where impact forces (N) and kick velocity (m∙s -1 ) were measured. The 3D kinematics and isokinetic dynamometry were used to estimate the kick velocity, isokinetic moment of kicking lower limb hip flexors and extensors (60, 120, 240, 300°∙s -1 ), and stance lower limb hip internal and external rotators (30, 90°∙s -1 ). Multiple regression showed that a separate component of the peak moment concentric hip flexion and extension of the kicking lower limb at 90°∙s -1 can explain 54% of the peak kicking impact force variance (R 2 = 0.54; p &lt; 0.001). When adding the other 3 components of eccentric and concentric hip internal and external rotations at 30°∙s -1 , the internal and external hip rotation ratios at 30°∙s -1 on the stance limb and the concentric ratio of kicking limb flexion and extension at 300°∙s -1 that explained the variance of impact force were 75% (p = 0.003). The explosive strength of kicking limb hip flexors and extensors is the main condition constraint for kicking performance. The maximum strength of stance limb internal and external rotators and speed strength of kicking limb hip flexors and extensors are important constraints of kicking performance that should be considered to improve the front kick efficiency."

The two bars loaded at 30% 1-repetition maximum were compared with ten trained Division I American football players (n = 10; age = 19.5 years; body mass = 89.4 kg; body height = 182.0 cm) completing 10 repetitions of the back squat exercise. Analysis included integrated-peak values of electromyography of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, rectus abdominis, erector spinae, external oblique, vastus lateralis, ground reaction forces, and joint kinematics and kinetics of the hip, knee, and ankle. The flexible bar elicited significant increases in peak joint kinetics (Hip Moment: 229 ± 54 Nm vs. 209 ± 52 Nm; Hip Power: 494 ± 151 W vs. 382 ± 134 W; Knee Power: 305 ± 108 W vs. 241 ± 63 W), peak vertical ground reaction forces (1195 ± 209 N vs. 1120 ± 203 N), and muscle activity (Vastus Lateralis: 75.7 vs. 66.5%, Rectus Abdominis: 190 vs. 115%, Rectus Femoris: 69.8 vs. 59.9%, External Oblique: 115 vs. 69.0%). Greater vertical ground reaction forces, hip moment, hip power, knee power, and muscle activity of the vastus lateralis, rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, and external oblique suggest the FB provides biomechanical and physiological mechanisms for training gains over the SB for 30% of 1-repetition maximum loads."
https://openalex.org/W2969648947,Biomechanical Analysis of Thumb Ulnar Collateral Ligament Tear Kinematics,2019-08-20,2019,article,"Background: Thumb ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries are common, but the kinematics of these injuries have not been comprehensively described, especially regarding kinematic changes with progressive UCL injury. Methods: Eleven cadaveric thumbs underwent kinematic testing under 4 conditions: intact, partial tear (50%) of the proper UCL, full tear of the proper UCL, and complete tear of both the proper and accessory UCL. Kinematic testing parameters included varus/valgus stress, pronation/supination, and volar/dorsal translation at -10 degree, 0 degree, 15 degree, and 30 degree of metacarpophalangeal flexion. Results: Partial tear of the proper UCL did not result in significant increases in laxity in any direction compared with intact (P ≥ .132). Full tear of the proper UCL resulted in a significant increase in valgus angulation (18.8° ± 1.7° vs 11.5° ± 1.5°; P = .024) and pronation (15.4° ± 2.5° vs 12.6° ± 2.3°; P = .034) at 30 degree of flexion relative to intact. Complete tear of both the proper and accessory collateral ligaments resulted in increased valgus angulation at all degrees of flexion (P < .001). Complete tear also resulted in a significant volar translation at 0 degree, 15 degree, and 30 degree of flexion (P ≤ .016). Conclusion: Partial tear of the proper UCL does not significantly affect the stability of the joint, but full tear of the proper UCL increases valgus instability at 30 degree of flexion. Complete tear of the UCL is necessary for increased varus/valgus instability at all degrees of flexion and results in significant increases in pronation/supination and volar translation."
https://openalex.org/W2969373558,Neuromuscular fatigue and recovery after strenuous exercise depends on skeletal muscle size and stem cell characteristics,2019-08-20,2019,preprint,"ABSTRACT Hamstring muscle injury is highly prevalent in sports involving repeated maximal sprinting. Although neuromuscular fatigue is thought to be a risk factor, the mechanisms underlying the fatigue response to repeated maximal sprints are unclear. Here, we show that repeated maximal sprints induce neuromuscular fatigue accompanied with a prolonged strength loss in hamstring muscles. The immediate hamstring strength loss was linked to both central and peripheral fatigue, while prolonged strength loss was associated with indicators of muscle damage. The kinematic changes immediately after sprinting likely protected fatigued hamstrings from excess elongation stress, while larger hamstring muscle physiological cross-sectional area and lower myoblast:fibroblast ratio appeared to protect against fatigue/damage and improve muscle recovery within the first 48 h after sprinting. We have therefore identified novel mechanisms that likely regulate the fatigue/damage response and initial recovery following repeated maximal sprinting in humans."

The coach initially underwent quantifiable familiarisation (blackness test) with the Borg CR100 scale. Data were collected from 16 semi-professional soccer players across seven consecutive training sessions. For the measurement of subjective training load, the coach and players provided dRPE (CR100) for legs (RPE-L), breathlessness (RPE-B) and technical exertion (RPE-T). Coach-prescribed dRPE were recorded prior to training, with coach observed and player reported dRPE collected post training. Statistical equivalence bounds for agreement between coach (prescribed and observed) and player reported dRPE scores were 4 arbitrary units on the CR100 and we used a probability outcome of likely (≥75%) to infer realistic equivalence. Following three familiarisation sessions, the coach improved their blackness test score from 39% to 83%. Coach observed and player reported RPE-T scores were likely equivalent, with all other comparisons not realistically equivalent. Since training prescription is coach-led, our data highlight the importance of accurate internal load measurement and feedback in soccer. The improved accuracy and precision of coach intensity estimation after three attempts at the blackness test suggests that this method could be worthwhile to researchers and practitioners employing dRPE."

Changes in torque-angle profiles of the hamstrings and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio after two hamstring strengthening exercise interventions in female hockey players. J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 396–405, 2020—The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 hamstring strengthening interventions (Nordic hamstrings [NHE] vs. eccentric leg curl [ELC]) on the hamstring torque-angle profiles and functional hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (H ecc :Q con ) in female hockey players. Female university-level players were randomly allocated to an NHE group ( n = 9, 19.7 ± 1.4 years; 168.4 ± 4.4 cm; 66.2 ± 7.2 kg, 26.0 ± 4.4%), an ELC group ( n = 8, 19.5 ± 1.0 years; 168.1 ± 3.4 cm; 66.7 ± 4.5 kg, 24.8 ± 3.5%), or a control (C) group ( n = 8, 19.6 ± 1.4 years; 169.9 ± 7.5 cm; 70.7 ± 13.0 kg, 25.9 ± 5.2%). They performed baseline isokinetic concentric strength tests of the quadriceps (Q con ) and eccentric strength of the hamstrings (H ecc ) at 120°·s −1 , followed by a 6-week intervention with exercises (NHE or ELC) performed 3 times weekly, before post-tests. Analyses of variance with repeated measures were used to assess the effects of knee position angle (from 90° of knee flexion to 10° close to extension), group, and time on Q con , H ecc , and H ecc :Q con . There were no interactions between independent variables. Significant increases in H ecc and H ecc :Q con were shown after NHE (+29.9 and +27.8%) and ELC (+30.5 and +38.3%) in the nondominant leg only. Furthermore, significant shifts in the hamstring eccentric angle of peak torque toward a longer muscle length were shown in both legs (14.3–28.6%). These findings suggest that NHE and ELC both resulted in significant improvements in peak and muscle-length–specific neuromuscular risk factors in the nondominant (ND) limb, thereby reducing interlimb peak strength asymmetries. Strength and conditioning specialists could therefore use both the NHE and ELC exercises in female hockey players."

Thus, this three-armed randomized controlled crossover pilot trial (RCT) examined the effects of trunk and upper body fatigue protocols on RE, trunk muscle isometric rate of force production, and lactate response in runners. Seven well-trained runners (2 males and 5 females) randomly underwent control (CON), trunk fatigue (TRK), and upper body fatigue (UPR) protocols on three different lab visits. Both workload-matched fatigue protocols-consisting of 24 min of a circuit weight routine-elicited comparable rates of perceived exertion, heart rate responses, and lactate accumulations. As expected, core muscle strength assessed with isometric testing immediately before and after both fatigue protocols, decreased notably. RE (VO2/kg bodyweight averaged for 1 min) was determined during a 15 min individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) run at 4, 9 and 14 min. The IAT (13.9 to 15.8 km/h) was determined on lab visit one using an incremental treadmill running protocol to volitional exhaustion. RE differed, although not significantly, between CON and both fatigue protocols by 0.75 (4th min) to 1.5 ml/min/kg (9th and 14th min) bodyweight (Time × Mode Interaction: p = 0.2, np2 = 0.40) with a moderate to large effect size. Despite no signficance, the largest RE differences were observed between TRK and CON (and underscored by the moderate to large effect size). This preliminary pilot RCT revealed that both UPR and TRK conditions might adversely impact running economy at a high intensity, steady state running pace. Future studies should elucidate if these findings are replicable in large scale trials and, in turn, whether periodized core training can beneficially preserve RE."

Some important differences now exist between this sub-category and the wider findings in the field and these could be detrimental to patients with persisting post-concussion symptoms (PCS). Sport-related studies often emphasize the cerebral risks associated with concussive injuries whilst the broader literature typically focuses on the relatively benign organic implications and the role of psychological factors in persisting symptoms. Clinically, anxiety caused by these mixed messages could lead to an exacerbation of PCS.

The central focus is the nature of search strategies to locate and create stable equilibrium regions in the perceptual-motor workspace and how these strategies relate to the emergent movement forms in the acquisition of coordination, control, and skill. In the ecological theory of perception and action, the enhanced stability of performance occurs through the attunement of the perceptual systems to the task dynamics together with modifications of action as task and intrinsic dynamics cooperate and/or compete. Thus, through practice in this search process, individuals adapt to the pick-up of task relevant perceptual variables and change their movement form according to the stability of the performed action and its outcome in relation to the task demands. Contemporary experimental findings have revealed features of the search process given the interaction of individual intrinsic dynamics in the context of task requirements and principles that drive the change - e.g., exploitation of more tolerant task-space solutions and emergence of compensatory mechanisms. Finally, we outline how the search strategy framework relates to traditional learning-related phenomena: including the dynamical pathways of learning, learning curves, factors of learning, individuality, motor development, and sport and rehabilitation interventions."

The aim of this study was to investigate the within- and between-session reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable difference (SDD)) of using a laser Doppler device (LAVEG-LAser VElocity Guard) to quantify deceleration ability in 20 amateur rugby union players. Each player performed one familiarisation and two experimental sessions (seven days apart) consisting of three maximal 15 m sprints from a standing start, with an immediate deceleration to a complete stop upon hearing an audible cue at the 15 m mark. Deceleration was evaluated by determining the distance required to decelerate to 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% ('stopping distance') of the velocity achieved at 15 m of the maximal sprint. Within-session relative reliability was moderate to good (ICC = 0.64-0.83) with borderline acceptable variation (CVs = 10.51%-16.71%) across all variables. Between-session reliability reported good to excellent relative reliability (ICC = 0.79-0.93) with acceptable absolute reliability, particularly for stopping distance (SEM: 6.54%; SDD: 9.11%).

https://openalex.org/W2967465275,Cluster analysis successfully identifies clinically meaningful knee valgus moment patterns: frequency of early peaks reflects sex-specific ACL injury incidence,2019-08-09,2019,article,"Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors frequently analyze only a fraction of the relevant data, and typically not in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value within a time series of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing and size of the peak value of interest.The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be a shape reflecting an early peak of the knee valgus moment, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have greater early peak frequencies.N = 213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N = 35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared tests.Six discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had greater frequency of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P < 0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had greater frequency of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P < 0.001 for full test).Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data, which likely reflect different movement strategies. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Greater frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher risk of ACL injury in sports."

In this study we sought to compare the emergent coordination strategies employed in vertical jumping under different task constraints [countermovement jump (CMJ) with arm swing-CMJas and no arm swing-CMJnas]. In order to achieve this, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on joint moment waveform data from the hip, knee and ankle. This statistical approach has the advantage of analyzing the whole movement within a time series and reduces multidimensional datasets to lower dimensions for analysis. Both individual and group analyses were conducted. For individual analysis, PCA was conducted on combined hip, knee, and ankle joint moment data for each individual across both CMJnas (thirty-eight participants), and CMJas (twenty-two participants) conditions. PCA was also performed comparing all data from each individual across CMJnas and CMJas conditions. The results revealed a maximum of three principal components (PC) explained over 90% of the variance in the data sets for both conditions and within individual and group analyses. For individual analysis, no more than 2PCs were required for both conditions. For group analysis, CMJas required 3PCs to explain over 90% of the variance within the dataset and CMJnas only required 2PCs. Reconstruction of the original NJM waveforms from the PCA output demonstrates a greater loading of hip and knee joint moments to PC1, with PC2 showing a greater loading to ankle joint moment. The reduction in dimensions of the original data shows the proximal to distal extension pattern in the sagittal plane, typical of vertical jumping tasks, is governed by only 2 functional DOF, at both a group, and individual level, rather than the typically reported 3 mechanical DOF in some forms of jumping."
https://openalex.org/W2968031019,Fascial organisation of motor synergies: a hypothesis,2019-08-08,2019,article,"In the field of biomechanics and motor control understanding movement coordination is paramount. Motor synergies represent the coordination of neural and physical elements embedded in our bodies in order to optimize the solutions to motor problems. Although we are able to measure and quantify the movement made manifested, we do not have confidence in explaining the anatomical bases of its organisation at different levels. It is our contention that the flexible hierarchical organization of movement relies on the fascial structurers to create functional linkages at different levels, and this concept attunes with the neural control of synergies. At the base of movement organization there is a (somatic) equilibrium point that exists on the fascia where the neurologically- and mechanically-generated tensions dynamically balance out. This somatic equilibrium point is at the base of postural control, afferent flow of information to the nervous system about the state of the muscles, and of the coordinative pre-activation of muscular contraction sequences specific for a synergy. Implications are discussed and suggestions for research and clinical applications are made."

The aims of this study were first to analyze racewalking judges’ accuracy in assessing technique and, second, to measure flight times across a range of speeds to establish when athletes were likely to lose visible contact. Twenty racewalkers were recorded in a laboratory using a panning video camera (50 Hz), a high-speed camera (100 Hz) and three force plates (1000 Hz). Eighty-three judges of different IAAF Levels (and none) viewed the panned videos online and indicated whether each athlete was racewalking legally. Flight times shorter than 0.033 s were detected by fewer than 12.5% of judges, and thus indicated non-visible loss of contact. Flight times between 0.040 and 0.045 s were usually detected by no more than three out of eight judges. Very long flight times (≥ 0.060 s) were detected by nearly all judges. The results also showed that what judges generally considered straightened knees (> 177°) was close to a geometrically straight line. Within this inexact definition, IAAF World Championship-standard Level III judges were most accurate, being more likely to detect anatomically bent knees and less likely to indicate bent knees when they did not occur. For the second part, the men racewalked down a 45-m indoor track at 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 km/h in a randomized order, whereas the women’s trials were at 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 km/h. Flight times, measured using an OptoJump Next photocell system (1000 Hz), increased for the men from 0.015 s at 11 km/h to 0.040 s at 14 km/h and 0.044 s at 15 km/h, and for the women from 0.013 s at 10 km/h to 0.041 s at 13 km/h and 0.050 s at 14 km/h. For judging by the human eye, the threshold for avoiding visible loss of contact therefore occurred for most athletes at approximately 14 km/h for men and 13 km/h for women."

Feedback plays a crucial role in this learning process, and Virtual Reality (VR) constitutes a unique tool to provide feedback and improve motor learning. In particular, VR grants the possibility to edit 3D movements and display augmented feedback in real time. Here we combined VR and motion capture to provide learners with a 3D feedback superimposing in real time the reference movements of an expert (expert feedback) to the movements of the learner (self-feedback). We assessed the effectiveness of this feedback for the learning of a throwing movement in American football. This feedback was used during (concurrent feedback) and/or after movement execution (delayed feedback), and it was compared with a feedback displaying only the reference movements of the expert. In contrast with more traditional studies relying on video feedback, we used the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm coupled to motion capture to measure the spatial characteristics of the movements. We also assessed the regularity with which the learner reproduced the reference movement along its path. For that, we used a new metric computing the dispersion of distance around the mean distance over time. Our results show that when the movements of the expert were superimposed on the movements of the learner during learning (i.e., self + expert), the reproduction of the reference movement improved significantly. On the hand, providing feedback about the movements of the expert only did not give rise to any significant improvement regarding movement reproduction."

The relationship between trunk control and sport-related injury has been emphasized; however, the isolated effects of core-muscle training are unclear.To investigate the effect of a simple 8-week core-muscle-training program on the neuromuscular control of the lower limb and trunk during jump landing and single-legged squatting.Controlled laboratory study.Laboratory.Seventeen female collegiate basketball players were randomly divided into training (n = 9; age = 19.7 ± 0.9 years) and control (n = 8; age = 20.3 ± 2.5 years) groups.The training group completed the core-muscle-training program in addition to daily practice, and the control group performed only daily practice. Kinematic and kinetic data during a drop-jump test and single-legged squat were acquired using a 3-dimensional motion-analysis system.Three-dimensional hip, knee, and trunk kinematics; knee kinetics; and isokinetic muscle strength were measured at the pretraining and posttraining phases.For the drop-jump test, the maximal trunk-flexion angle increased (P = .008), and peak knee-valgus moment (P = .008) decreased in the training group. For the single-legged squat, the peak trunk-flexion angle increased (P = .04), and the total amount of trunk lateral-inclination angle (P = .02) and peak knee-valgus moment (P = .008) decreased in the training group. We observed no changes in the control group.A consecutive 8-week core-muscle-training program improved lower limb and trunk biomechanics.

In an attempt to limit repetitive head impact exposure during the football preseason, the NCAA eliminated two-a-day practices in 2017, while maintaining the total number of team practice sessions. The objective of this study was to quantify head impact exposure during the preseason and regular season in Division I college football athletes to determine whether the 2017 NCAA ruling decreased head impact exposure. 342 unique athletes from five NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs were consented and enrolled. Head impacts were recorded using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System during the entire fall preseasons and regular seasons in 2016 and 2017. Despite the elimination of two-a-day practices, the number of preseason contact days increased in 2017, with an increase in average hourly impact exposure (i.e., contact intensity), resulting in a significant increase in total head impact burden (+ 26%) for the 2017 preseason. This finding would indicate that the 2017 NCAA ruling was not effective at reducing the head impact burden during the football preseason. Additionally, athletes sustained a significantly higher number of recorded head impacts per week (+ 40%) during the preseason than the regular season, implicating the preseason as a time of elevated repetitive head impact burden. With increased recognition of a possible association between repetitive head impact exposure and concussion, increased preseason exposure may predispose certain athletes to a higher risk of concussion during the preseason and regular season. Accordingly, efforts at reducing concussion incidence in contact sports should include a reduction in overall head impact exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2964502158,Investigation of Cross-Species Scaling Methods for Traumatic Brain Injury Using Finite Element Analysis,2019-08-06,2019,article,"Scaling methods are used to relate animal exposure data to humans by determining equivalent biomechanical impact conditions that result in similar tissue-level mechanics for different species. However, existing scaling methods for traumatic brain injury (TBI) do not account for the anatomical and morphological complexity of the brains for different species and have not been validated based on accurate anatomy and realistic material properties. In this study, the relationship between the TBI condition and brain tissue deformation was investigated using human, baboon, and macaque brain finite element (FE) models, which featured macro- and mesoscale anatomical details. The aim was to evaluate existing scaling methods in predicting similar biomechanical responses in the different species using both idealized and real-world TBI pulses. A second aim was to develop a new method to improve how animal data are scaled to humans. As previously found in humans, the animal's brain response to the rotational head motion was well characterized by single-degree-of-freedom (sDOF) mechanical systems with resonance at certain natural frequency, and this concept was leveraged to develop a new TBI scaling method based the natural frequency of the sDOF models representing each species. Previously described biomechanical scaling methods based on mass or inertia ratios were poor predictors of equivalent strain. The novel frequency-based scaling method was an improved approach to scaling the equivalent loading conditions. The findings of this study enable better interpretation of mechanical-trauma responses obtained from animal data to the human, thus effectively advancing the development of human injury criteria and contributing toward the mitigation of TBI."

The dual plating technique used smaller diameter plates and screws (1.6-mm thickness) than the other, single plate techniques (3.3-mm thickness). Each of the 9 clavicle pairs was randomly assigned a combination of 2 plating techniques, and randomization was used to determine which techniques were used for the right and left specimens. Clavicles were plated and then osteotomized to create an inferior butterfly fracture model, which was then fixed with a single interfragmentary screw. Clavicle specimens were then potted for mechanical testing. Initial bending, axial, and torsional stiffness of each construct was determined through use of a randomized nondestructive cyclic testing protocol followed by load to failure.No significant differences were found in cyclical axial (P = .667) or torsional (P = .526) stiffness between plating groups. Anteroinferior plating demonstrated significantly higher cyclical bending stiffness than superior plating (P = .005). No significant difference was found in bending stiffness between dual plating and either anteroinferior (P = .129) or superior plating (P = .067). No significant difference was noted in load to failure among plating methods (P = .353).Dual plating with a smaller plate-screw construct is biomechanically similar to superior and anteroinferior single plate fixation that uses larger plate-screw constructs. No significant differences were found between dual plating and either superior or anteroinferior single plating in axial, bending, or torsional stiffness or in bending load to failure. Dual small plating is a viable option for fixing midshaft clavicle fractures and may be a useful low-profile technique that avoids a larger and more prominent plate-screw construct.Plate prominence and hardware irritation are commonly reported complaints and reasons for revision surgery after plate fixation of midshaft clavicle fractures. Dual small plate fixation has been used to improve cosmetic acceptability, minimize hardware irritation, and decrease reoperation rate. Biomechanically, dual small plate fixation performed similarly to larger single plate fixation in this cadaveric model of butterfly fracture."

In a prospective longitudinal design, we demonstrate there are reductions in midbrain white matter integrity due to a single season of collegiate football, and that the amount of reduction in midbrain white matter integrity is related to the amount of rotational acceleration to which players' brains are exposed. We then replicate the observation of reduced midbrain white matter integrity in a retrospective cohort of individuals with frank concussion, and further show that variance in white matter integrity is correlated with levels of serum-based tau, a marker of blood-brain barrier disruption. These findings mean that noninvasive structural MRI of the midbrain is a succinct index of both clinically silent white matter injury as well as frank concussion."

Despite national efforts to harmonize the recognition and management of pediatric concussion in Canada, timely access to primary and specialized care following this injury remains a challenge for many patients especially those who live in rural and remote communities. To address similar challenges facing patients with stroke and other neurological disorders, physicians have begun to leverage advances in telemedicine to improve the delivery of specialized neurological care to those living in medically underserved regions. Preliminary studies suggest that telemedicine may be a safe and cost-effective approach to assist in the medical care of select patients with acute concussion and persistent post-concussion symptoms. Here we provide an overview of telemedicine, teleneurology, the principles of concussion assessment and management, as well as the current state of concussion care in Canada. Utilizing preliminary evidence from studies of telemedicine in concussion and experience from comprehensive systems of care for stroke, we outline steps that must be taken to evaluate the potential of telemedicine-based concussion networks to improve the care of pediatric concussion patients living in underserved rural and remote communities in Canada."

Effects of maturation on physical fitness adaptations to plyometric jump training in youth females. J Strength Cond Res 35(10): 2870–2877, 2021—The aim of this study was to compare the effects of maturation on physical fitness adaptations to plyometric jump training (PJT) in youth females. Jumping, sprinting, change of direction speed, endurance, and maximal strength were measured pre-post 6 weeks of PJT in 7th- and 10th-grade subjects. In the seventh grade, subjects formed a PJT group (Plyo-7, n = 10; age, 12.7 ± 0.6 years; breast maturation stages IV [ n = 2], III [ n = 7], and II [ n = 1]) and an active control group (Con-7, n = 9; age, 12.8 ± 0.6 years; breast maturation stages IV [ n = 2], III [ n = 6], and II [ n = 1]). In the 10th grade, subjects conformed a PJT group (Plyo-10, n = 9; age, 16.3 ± 0.5 years; breast maturation stages V [ n = 5] and IV [ n = 4]) and an active control group (Con-10, n = 9; age, 16.2 ± 0.5 years; breast maturation stages V [ n = 5] and IV [ n = 4]). Magnitude-based inferences were used for data analysis, with effect sizes (ESs) interpreted as &lt;0.2 = trivial; 0.2–0.6 = small; 0.6–1.2 = moderate; 1.2–2.0 = large; and 2.0–4.0 = very large. The Plyo-7 and Plyo-10 showed meaningful improvements in all physical fitness measures (ES = 0.21–2.22), while Con-7 and Con-10 showed only trivial changes. The Plyo-7 and Plyo-10 showed meaningful (ES = 0.16–2.22) greater improvements in all physical fitness measures when compared with their control counterparts. The Plyo-10 showed meaningful greater improvements in 20-m sprint, 2-km running time trial, maximal strength, squat jump, and drop jump from 20 cm (ES = 0.21–0.42) when compared with Plyo-7. In conclusion, PJT is effective in improving physical fitness in younger and older female youths. However, greater adaptations were observed in more mature subjects."

This study presents a mathematical approach to the measurement of passing decisions of Australian Rules footballers that considers the risk and reward of passing options. A new method for quantifying a player's spatial influence is demonstrated through a process called commitment modelling, in which the bounds and density of a player's motion model are fit on empirical commitment to contests, producing a continuous representation of a team's spatial ownership. This process involves combining the probability density functions of contests that a player committed to, and those they did not. Spatiotemporal player tracking data was collected for AFL matches played at a single stadium in the 2017 and 2018 seasons. It was discovered that the probability of a player committing to a contest decreases as a function of their velocity and of the ball's time-to-point. Furthermore, the peak density of player commitment probabilities is at a greater distance in front of a player the faster they are moving, while their ability to participate in contests requiring re-orientation diminishes at higher velocities. Analysis of passing decisions revealed that, for passes resulting in a mark, opposition pressure is bimodal, with peaks at spatial dominance equivalent to no pressure and to a one-on-one contest. Density of passing distance peaks at 17.3 m, marginally longer than the minimum distance of a legal mark (15 m). Conversely, the model presented in this study identifies long-range options as have higher associated decision-making values, however a lack of passes in these ranges may be indicative of differing tactical behaviour or a difficulty in identifying long-range options."

While bicycle helmets help protect cyclists who crash, limited biomechanical data exist differentiating helmet protective capabilities. This paper describes the development of a bicycle helmet evaluation scheme based in real-world cyclist accidents and brain injury mechanisms. Thirty helmet models were subjected to oblique impacts at six helmet locations and two impact velocities. The summation of tests for the analysis of risk (STAR) equation, which condenses helmet performance from a range of tests into a single value, was used to summarize measured linear and rotational head kinematics in the context of concussion risk. STAR values varied between helmets (10.9-25.3), with lower values representing superior protection. Road helmets produced lower STAR values than urban helmets. Helmets with slip planes produced lower STAR values than helmets without. This bicycle helmet evaluation protocol can educate consumers on the relative impact performance of various helmets and stimulate safer helmet design."

Carbon nanofilm, as a biocompatible and easy to functionalize material, could be used to mimic ECM structures, changing cancer cell behavior to perform like normal cells. Methods: Experiments were performed in vitro with HS-5 cells (as a control) and HepG2 and C3A cancer cells. An aqueous solution of fullerene C60 was used to form a nanofilm. The morphological properties of cells cultivated on C60 nanofilms were evaluated with light, confocal, electron and atomic force microscopy. The cell viability and proliferation were measured by XTT and BrdU assays. Immunoblotting and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the expression level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and determine the number of cells in the G2/M phase. Results: All cell lines were spread on C60 nanofilms, showing a high affinity to the nanofilm surface. We found that C60 nanofilm mimicked the niche/ECM of cells, was biocompatible and non-toxic, but the mechanical signal from C60 nanofilm created an environment that affected the cell cycle and reduced cell proliferation. Conclusion: The results indicate that C60 nanofilms might be a suitable, substitute component for the niche of cancer cells. The incorporation of fullerene C60 in the ECM/niche may be an alternative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma."

During desiccation, the exocarp shrinks and splits open, and subsequent endocarp deformation is a complex three-dimensional shape change, including formation of dehiscence lines, opening of the apical part and formation of a constriction at the middle part. Owing to the constriction forming, mechanical pressure is increasingly applied on the seed until ejection. We describe a structural latch system consisting of connective cellular structures between endocarp and seed, which break with a distinct cracking sound upon ejection. A maximum seed velocity of 12.3 m s −1 , maximum launch acceleration of 19 853 m s −2 (approx. 2000 g ) and maximum seed rotational velocity of 25 714 min −1 were measured. We argue that miniscule morphological differences between the inner endocarp surface and seed, which features a notable ridge, are responsible for putting spin on the seed. This hypothesis is further corroborated by the observation that there is no preferential seed rotation direction among fruits. Our findings show that H. mollis has evolved similar mechanisms for stabilizing a ‘shot out’ seed as humans use for stabilizing rifle bullets and are discussed in an ecological (dispersal biology), biomechanical (seed ballistics) and functional–morphological (fine-tuning and morphospace of functional endocarps) contexts, and promising additional aspects for future studies are proposed."

It is present in approximately 8% of individuals, and whilst the majority of these individuals are unaffected it can cause significant pain and disability. It can impact seemingly unrelated surgical intervention in the region such as subacromial decompression and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. A painful os acromiale can be both a diagnostic challenge, and difficult to manage. There remain a wide variety of surgical practices with variable outcomes achieved. We present an evidence-based discussion of the surgical techniques described to date in the literature, alongside a comprehensive review of the incidence and pathophysiology of os acromiale. This review was written after a comprehensive analysis of the literature to date relating to os acromiale. Particular focus was given to material examining surgical management techniques, and the condition’s incidence across different population groups. Open reduction and internal fixation using cannulated screws, or tension band wiring have superior outcomes in the literature in the treatment of symptomatic os acromiale. There may be a biomechanical advantage of combining the two techniques. Preservation of large anterior deltoid attachment is necessary, with consideration being given to the local blood supply. There is likely no additional benefit from iliac crest vs local bone grafting. Research in this area remains of a low evidence level with small samples sizes. Appropriately powered clinical research of a higher-level evidence methodology is needed in order to differentiate further in the choice of surgical intervention.

We hypothesized that male ice hockey players would sustain more injuries compared with female ice hockey players and that the injuries sustained would be more severe.Descriptive epidemiology study.Data on all foot and ankle injuries sustained during the academic years 2004 through 2014 were obtained from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program. Injury rates, rate ratios (RRs), and injury proportion ratios were reported with 95% CIs.Over the study period, the overall rate of foot and ankle injuries for men was higher than that for women (413 vs 103 injuries, respectively; RR, 4.01 [95% CI, 3.23-4.97]). Injury rates were highest during the regular season for both men (358 injuries; RR, 64.78 [95% CI, 58.07-71.49]) and women (89 injuries; RR, 38.37 [95% CI, 30.40-46.35]) compared with the preseason or postseason. The most common injury in men was a foot and/or toe contusion (22.5%), while women most commonly sustained a low ankle sprain (31.1%). For men, foot and/or toe contusions accounted for the most non-time loss (≤24 hours ) and moderate time-loss (2-13 days) injuries, while high ankle sprains accounted for the most severe time-loss (≥14 days) injuries. For women, foot and/or toe contusions accounted for the most non-time loss injuries, low ankle sprains accounted for the most moderate time-loss injuries, and high ankle sprains accounted for the most severe time-loss injuries.Foot and ankle injuries were frequent among collegiate ice hockey players during the period studied. For men, contusions were the most commonly diagnosed injury, although high ankle sprains resulted in the most significant time lost. For women, low ankle sprains were the most common and resulted in the most moderate time lost. These findings may direct future injury prevention and guide improvements in ice skate design."

In female athletes, the incidence of ACL rupture has been reported to be significantly higher than in their male counterparts. However, to date, there have been limited reports and controversy regarding sex differences underlying injury mechanisms of ACL and severity of injury. In this study, we hypothesized that 1) in patients with non-contact ACL rupture, the incidence and severity of pivot shift injury, which are determined by injury pattern on MRI, would be significantly higher in females, and 2) anatomical factors associated with pivot shift injury would be significantly associated with female sex. A total of 148 primary ACL ruptures (145 patients) caused by non-contact injury mechanisms were included in this study. Among them, 41 knees (41 patients) were female and 107 knees (104 patients) were male. The status of the osseous lesions, lateral and medial tibial slope, depth of the medial tibial plateau, collateral ligaments, and menisci were assessed by MRI and compared between sexes. The severity of osseous lesions at the lateral tibial plateau, lateral femoral condyle, medial tibial plateau, and medial femoral condyle were comparable between sexes. There were no significant differences between sexes in the location of tibial contusions (p = 0.21), femoral contusions (p = 0.23), or meniscus tears (p = 0.189). Lateral tibial slope was found to be significantly larger in females (8.95° vs. 6.82°; p<0.0001; odds ratio = 1.464), and medial tibial depth was significantly shallower in females (1.80mm vs. 2.41mm; p<0.0001; odds ratio = 0.145). In conclusion, females showed greater lateral tibial slope and shallower medial tibial depth compared to males, however it did not affect the sex differences in injury pattern."

Forty-two young women (aged 16-20) playing soccer in a sports club in Poland were examined and compared with controls. The spatial coordinates (x, y, z) of the selected body points were determined. Four points (OcL, OcR, PvL and PvR) were extracted and used to calculate vectors [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for analysis. The results show that median of the pelvic line angle was positive (PvR was lower than PvL) in both groups. For the habitual posture, the absolute value of the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles in the pelvic line was almost three times greater among the soccer players than the controls (ratio between soccer players and controls: 2.93). Static postural imbalances in female soccer players require diagnosis of the sacroiliac joints with analysis of lumbar-pelvic system support and inhibition in the context of myofascial connection integration. Exercises can be implemented to stabilize the lumbar-pelvis complex as prophylaxis for spinal overload during the training cycle."

Consequently, playing rugby may confer health benefits; however, to date, the principal focus of research has been on associated injuries and potential detrimental long-term health sequelae. This protocol outlines the methods behind studying any potential associations between rugby union and both physical and mental health.Best practice methodological frameworks (Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al and the Joanna Briggs Institute) and previously published scoping review protocols in sport informs the methodology of this protocol. This protocol enables us to map the key concepts and evidence available, summarise and share existing research ﬁndings, and identify research gaps in the current literature. A three-step search strategy will identify reviews, original research, and published and grey literature. An initial search will identify suitable search terms, followed by a search using keyword and index terms. Two reviewers will independently screen identiﬁed studies for final inclusion.When publishing the scoping review, we will map key concepts and evidence both numerically and thematically, as well as identify key research priorities for further studies. The review will subsequently be disseminated to stakeholder groups, practitioners and policymakers through a variety of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications, conferences and via multimedia platforms."

Recent consensus work designated four causative clinical entities, with the adductor/rectus aponeurosis and pubic symphysis capsule emphasized as key areas. This article highlights these key aspects of athletic groin injury with tips on anatomy, potential abnormalities, acronyms, and imaging appearances in this complex but common and potentially incapacitating entity. Many clinical and radiologic terms are in use such as cleft, enthesitis, plate injury, or defect that can cause confusion, and thus anatomical descriptions are preferable. Detailed clinical assessment is necessary but remains challenging because of the nonspecific presentations. Imaging, and in particular magnetic resonance imaging, plays an essential role in the evaluation process. But only when the two are used in combination can an accurate diagnosis be reached because several studies in asymptomatic athletes show that reactive changes are common."

This involves at least the participation of a transmitter and a receiver. It could be the process of encoding, transmitting, receiving and decoding ""signals"" regarding the exchange of information and ideas between participants.To communicate, we use more than words: in our interactions with others, our body has its own language. Our gestures and eye contact are ways of communication, visual messages that influence the messages we deliver verbally. Managers who effectively manage the negative emotions at work are attentive to the messages they communicate verbally and non-verbally, as well as to their way of doing this. Communication is essential in people's lives, because in this way individuals can understand, interact, create relationships, develop themselves, their lives get more beautiful and harmonious shades. The main elements in communication are speech and spoken language, with which we can send messages. If the language in which the communication takes place is known to all participants, then it will be conducted in good conditions, without the risk of proper non-acceptance of the message."

https://openalex.org/W2972103221,Sex Effects on Ankle Biomechanics During Sports-Relevant Tasks and Peroneal Muscle Parameters,2019-08-01,2019,dissertation,"Introduction: Ankle sprains from excessive inversion are the most frequent sports- related injury. Common ankle prophylactics are designed to prevent injury by limiting excessive ankle inversion, yet may restrict other ankle motions leading to repeated re-injury. Females are twice as likely as males to suffer an ankle sprain, however, it is unknown if a sex dimorphism in ankle biomechanics exists when wearing ankle prophylactics, and whether differences in the peroneal musculature exist between sexes. Purpose: To quantify the ability of ankle prophylactics (Ankle Roll Guard (ARG), Brace, Control, and Tape) to prevent excessive ankle inversion during a sudden inversion event, and determine whether the effectiveness of the ankle prophylactics and in vivo peroneal muscle parameters differ between sexes. Methods: Thirty-two (16 male and 16 female) participants had dominant limb (i.e., braced) frontal and sagittal plane ankle biomechanics, including peak inversion and plantarflexion angle and range of motion (ROM), and time to peak inversion, quantified during the sudden inversion event with four prophylactic conditions (ARG, Brace, Control, and Tape) and peroneal muscle parameters recorded. With each prophylactic, participants performed five successful trials of the sudden inversion event. Peroneal muscle parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and stiffness, were quantified in vivo using ultrasound shear-wave elastography, while peroneal strength was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. Statistical Analysis: All kinematic variables were submitted to a RM ANOVA to test for main effect and interaction of brace (ARG, Brace, Control, and Tape) and sex (male and female). Peroneal muscle parameters were also submitted to independent samples t-test to test the effect of sex. Results: A prophylactic by sex interaction (p = 0.010), revealed females exhibit greater ankle inversion ROM with Control and ARG (p = 0.001, p = 0.010) compared to males. Females also exhibited greater ankle inversion ROM with ARG compared to Brace (p = 0.001), and Control compared to Brace and Tape (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), while males exhibited no significant difference between any prophylactic condition (p > 0.05). Ankle prophylactic impacted ankle inversion ROM (p < 0.001), time to peak inversion (p < 0.001), and peak plantarflexion angle (p < 0.001) and ROM (p < 0.001). Females exhibited smaller peroneal PCSA (p = 0.002) and dorsiflexion strength (p = 0.047), but sex had no significant effect on peroneal strength (p =0.142) or stiffness (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The protective benefits of ankle prophylactics may depend on the specific device and sex of the user. With the lace-up brace and tape, participants decreased ankle biomechanics associated with injury, but this protective benefit was only evident for females. Females exhibited a sex dimorphism in ankle biomechanics during the sudden inversion event, and smaller and weaker peroneals that may contribute to the sex disparity in injury rate."

Twenty-five college students were stratified into a single peak curve group and a double peak curve group. Eight infrared cameras and two force platforms were synchronized to collect the data. Independent t-tests were performed with groups for each dependent kinematic, kinetic and time of the joint extensor concentric contraction variable. Repeated one-way analysis of variance measurements were performed for the time of the ankle, knee and hip extensor concentric contraction in each group. The double peak curve was associated with larger jump height, reactive strength index modified, rate of force development, impulse, hip, knee and ankle flexion, extension angular displacement, and hip and knee moments (p&lt;0.05). The double peak curve group revealed a better hip, knee and ankle (proximal to distal) timing of extensor concentric contractions sequence of the lower extremities during the countermovement jump (p&lt;0.05). The double peak curve group exhibited a more effective countermovement jump movement with respect to biomechanics compared to the single peak curve group."

This study investigated and compared, for the first time, human adults' laterality for manipulation and gestures in a non-experimental social context. We analysed the manual laterality of 48 beach volleyball athletes for four frequently expressed behaviours: a complex throwing action (jump serve) and three gestures (CLAP HAND, PUMP FIST and SLAP HAND-TO-HAND). We evaluated population-level laterality bias for each of the four behaviours separately, compared manual laterality between behaviours and investigated factors influencing gestural laterality. We furthered our between-gestures comparison by taking into account three categories of factors simultaneously: gesture characteristics (sensory modality), interactional context components (positions of interactants and emotional valence), and individual demographic characteristics (age, sex and country). Our study showed that (1) each behaviour considered presented a population-level right-hand bias, (2) differences of laterality between behaviours were probably related to gesture sensory modality and (3) signaller's laterality was modulated differently in relation to positions of interactants, emotional valence, age and sex. Our results support the literature suggesting that left-hemisphere specialization for manipulation and language (speech and gestures) may have evolved from complex manual activities such as throwing and from gestural communication."

So, the purpose of this study was to examine the consistency of relative timing as a fixed feature of a GMP in overhand throwing with changing the distance to target as a varied feature.Methods Fifteen individuals with DS (age = 13 ± 2 y) and a control group of 12 individuals without intellectual disability (ID; age = 13 ± 2 y) were asked to throw a tennis ball to a fixed target from three distances of 2, 2.75, and 3.25 m, respectively. Instant of occurrence of the following discrete variables was recorded by motion analysis: initiation of elbow extension, maximum shoulder angular velocity, maximum elbow angular velocity, and maximum resultant hand velocity.Results Results of two-way analysis of variance test did not show any significant difference in any of the relative kinematic variables in distances and groups (p > 0.05).Conclusion It seems that individuals with DS are able to motor preprogram and they use a GMP to overhand throwing from different distances as well as those without ID. Also, slowness and reaction time are unrelated to pre-programming and GMP as it relates to overhand throwing."

https://openalex.org/W2965779470,Throwing performance in water polo is related to in-water shoulder proprioception,2019-07-29,2019,article,"Water polo players require a high level of upper-extremity strength, flexibility and coordination to achieve a peak level of throwing performance. Increased levels of shoulder proprioceptive acuity, strength and range of motion (ROM) have been previously associated with higher sporting performance. A coach-rating scale, used to quantify an athlete's kicking proficiency in soccer; was adapted in the current study to measure each coach's subjective expert opinion regarding athletes' throwing mechanics, velocity, and accuracy. To examine this hypothesis shoulder proprioception acuity of 18 water polo players was measured both in-water and on-land using an AMEDA apparatus and correlated with coach-rated throwing performance and clinical measures of shoulder strength and ROM. There was a moderate positive correlation between the in-water and the on-land proprioception acuity (r = 0.47, p < 0.05). The in-water score showing a strong positive correlation with coach rated throwing mechanics (r = 0.68, p < 0.05) and velocity (r = 0.75, p = 0.02), suggesting that superior proprioception acuity contributed to fast, mechanically-efficient throwing. These findings support the notion that in-water proprioceptive acuity is an important determinant of the throwing performance achieved by water polo athletes and its measurement may be a valuable adjunct to current athlete screening."

Further explore possible mechanisms underlying differences in vascular physiology using hemodynamic parameters modeled using calibrated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Method: End-tidal targeting and dual-echo MRI were combined to probe hypercapnic and hyperoxic challenges in athletes with (n = 32) and without (n = 31) a history of SRC. Concurrent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) data were used to compute BOLD-CVR, ASL-CVR, and other physiological parameters including resting oxygen extraction fraction (OEF0) and cerebral blood volume (CBV0). Multiple linear and logistic regressions were then used to identify dominant parameters driving group-differences in BOLD-CVR. Results: Robust evidence for elevated BOLD-CVR were found in athletes with SRC history spreading over parts of the cortical hemispheres. Follow-up analyses showed co-localized differences in ASL-CVR (representing modulation of cerebral blood flow) and hemodynamic factors representing static vascular (i.e., CBV0) and metabolic (i.e., OEF0) effects suggesting that group-based differences in BOLD-CVR may be driven by a mixed effect from factors with vascular and metabolic origins. Conclusion: These results emphasize that while BOLD-CVR offers promises as a surrogate non-specific biomarker for cerebrovascular health following SRC, multiple hemodynamic parameters can affect its relative measurements.

Only participants who showed normal knee valgus during a drop landing screening test were recruited. Twelve junior athletes performed single leg squats while maintaining a knee flexion angle of 60°. The squats were executed in three foot positions: neutral (0°), adduction (-10°), and abduction (+10°). Three-dimensional motion analysis was used to capture the lower extremity kinematics of the participants' preferred limb. The hip and knee kinematics in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes during squatting were compared across the three foot positions using one-way ANOVA.The participants showed a normal range of dynamic knee valgus (5.3°±1.6). No statistically significant differences were observed in hip flexion (p = 0.322), adduction (p = 0.834), or internal rotation (p = 0.967) across different foot positions. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were observed in knee flexion (p = 0.489), adduction (p = 0.822), or internal rotation (p = 0.971) across different foot positions.Small changes in transverse plane foot position do not affect lower extremity kinematics during single leg squat in highly trained adolescent males with normal dynamic knee valgus. Our findings may provide guidance on safer techniques for landing, pivoting, and cutting during training and game situations.حققت هذه الدراسة في تأثير وضع القدم في المستوى العرضي على حركيات الأطراف السفلية أثناء القرفصاء بساق واحدة.أُجريت هذه الدراسة المقطعية بين رياضيين ذكور مدربين تدريبا عاليا. وتمت إضافة فقط المشاركين من ذوي الركبة الطبيعية الروحية عند اختبار الهبوط الإسقاطي الفحصي. قام ١٢ رياضيا مبتدئا بالتقرفص بساق واحدة، مع الحفاظ على زاوية انثناء الركبة عند٦٠ درجة. طُبقَّت جلسات القرفصاء بثلاثة أوضاع للقدم: المعتدل (صفر درجة)، وتقريب القدم (-١٠ درجة)، وإبعاد القدم (+١٠ درجة). استخدم التحليل الحركة ثلاثي الأبعاد لالتقاط القياسات الحركية للطرف السفلي المفضل لدى المشاركين. تمت مقارنة القياسات الحركية للورك والركبة في المستويات السهمية والجبهية والعرضية أثناء القرفصاء وعلى ثلاثة أوضاع للقدم باستخدام تحليل التباين أحادي الاتجاه ""أنوفا"".ظهر لدى المشاركين معدلا طبيعيا من الركبة الروحاء الديناميكية [٥.٣ درجة (± ١.٦)]. لم تُلاحظ أي فروق ذات دلالة إحصائية في انثناء الورك، وتقريب الورك والدوران الداخلي عبر أوضاع مختلفة للقدم. وبالمثل، لم يُلاحظ وجود فروق ذات دلالة إحصائية في ثني الركبة، وتقريب الركبة والدوران الداخلي عبر أوضاع مختلفة للقدم.لا تؤثر التغييرات الصغيرة في وضع القدم في المستوى العرضي على حركيات الطرف السفلي عند القرفصاء بساق واحدة عند الذكور المراهقين المدربين تدريبا عاليا أثناء وضعية الركبة الروحاء الديناميكية ضمن النطاق الطبيعي. وقد توفر نتائجنا إرشادات حول أساليب أكثر أمانا للهبوط، والتمحور والقطع أثناء التدريب والحالات المتعلقة بالألعاب."

Specifically, to evaluate 1) morning wellness-recovery with the current day loads (same-day analysis), and 2) the current day loads with wellness-recovery the following morning (next-day analysis). Objective (total distance and training impulse) and subjective (session RPE) load metrics as well as subjective indices of recovery and wellness were monitored daily with a women's U21 field hockey team (n = 16) during a 16-day European tour (8 matches and 7 training sessions). Linear-mixed models were used to quantify the relationship between load and wellness-recovery metrics. A unit rise in wellness was associated with a 37.8 m increase in total distance for the sessions that day (p = .038); otherwise there were no correlations observed between load and wellness-recovery metrics for same-day and next-day analysis. There was substantial intra-individual variation among players for these relationships. Over the course of a typical field hockey event player responses were not evident at a group-level. Therefore, it is important for coaches and support staff to monitor individual changes in the loads experienced along with wellness-recovery patterns. Subsequent adjustments could have implications regarding performance, fatigue management, and athlete well-being."

There is minimal literature investigating Polo players’ physical attributes, hence the understanding of the physical characteristics that may contribute to an improved handicap are unknown. This study sought to identify the relationship between pertinent strength measures (left and right hand grip strength; absolute and relative isometric mid-thigh pull) and reaction time in Polo handicap in 19 New Zealand Polo players, and ascertain whether handicap could be predicted by these measures. Correlation coefficients were expressed using R values, accompanying descriptors and 90% confidence intervals (C.I.). Variance explained was expressed via the R2 statistic, and statistical significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Right hand grip strength, isometric mid-thigh pull values were found to significantly correlate to and explain variance within Polo player handicap (all moderate to large correlations; p &lt; 0.05). Whereas left hand grip strength (R: 0.380; 90% C.I. −0.011 to 0.670) and reaction time (0.020; −0.372 to 0.406) were non-significant, moderate and trivial correlates and predictors of handicap respectively. Practically, these findings highlight the differing roles between rein and mallet hands of Polo players and emphasise the importance of a strong and stable platform when riding and striking the ball. Lack of association with reaction time may be explained in part by higher handicapped Polo players employing a more proactive approach to the game."

Secondary aims were to quantify sex differences and relationships among the variables. Methods In this cross-sectional study of elite athletes, 235 women (23 ± 5 y and 65 ± 7 kg) and 431 men (23 ± 4 y and 80 ± 12 kg) from 23 different sports (including 128 medalists from World Championships and/or Olympic Games) were tested in a 40-m sprint at the Norwegian Olympic Training Center between 1995 and 2018. These were pre-existing data from quarterly or semi-annual testing that the athletes performed for training purposes. Anthropometric and speed-time sprint data were used to calculate the theoretical maximal velocity, horizontal force, horizontal power, slope of the force-velocity relationship, maximal ratio of force, and index of force application technique. Results Substantial differences in mechanical profiles were observed across sports. Athletes in sports in which sprinting ability is an important predictor of success (e.g., athletics sprinting, jumping and bobsleigh) produced the highest values for most variables, whereas athletes in sports in which sprinting ability is not as important tended to produce substantially lower values. The sex differences ranged from small to large, depending on variable of interest. Although most of the variables were strongly associated with 10- and 40-m sprint time, considerable individual differences in sprint mechanical variables were observed among equally performing athletes. Conclusions Our data from a large sample of elite athletes tested under identical conditions provides a holistic picture of the force-velocity-power profile continuum in athletes. The data indicate that sprint mechanical variables are more individual than sport specific. The values presented in this study could be used by coaches to develop interventions that optimize the training stimulus to the individual athlete."

https://openalex.org/W2963372803,Accounting for Variance in Concussion Tolerance Between Individuals: Comparing Head Accelerations Between Concussed and Physically Matched Control Subjects,2019-07-24,2019,article,"Researchers have been collecting head impact data from instrumented football players to characterize the biomechanics of concussion for the past 15 years, yet the link between biomechanical input and clinical outcome is still not well understood. We have previously shown that even though concussive biomechanics might be unremarkable in large datasets of head impacts, the impacts causing injury are of high magnitude for the concussed individuals relative to their impact history. This finding suggests a need to account for differences in tolerance at the individual level. In this study, we identified control subjects for our concussed subjects who demonstrated traits we believed were correlated to factors thought to affect injury tolerance, including height, mass, age, race, and concussion history. A total of 502 college football players were instrumented with helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays and provided complete baseline assessment data, 44 of which sustained a total of 49 concussion. Biomechanical measures quantifying impact frequency and acceleration magnitude were compared between groups. On average, we found that concussed subjects experienced 93.8 more head impacts (p = 0.0031), 10.2 more high magnitude impacts (p = 0.0157), and 1.9 × greater risk-weighted exposure (p = 0.0175) than their physically matched controls. This finding provides further evidence that head impact data need to be considered at the individual level and that cohort wide assessments may be of little value in the context of concussion."

Influence of a functional core stability program on trunk and knee joint biomechanics in female athletes during lateral movements. J Strength Cond Res 35(10): 2713-2719, 2021-Trunk positioning has been shown to be associated with knee joint loading during athletic tasks, especially changes of direction. Quasistatic and conventional core stability (CS) training did not improve the biomechanics of cutting maneuvers according to reports in the literature. The purpose of this study was to test whether a 5-week dynamic and functional CS training program would improve trunk positioning and knee joint control during lateral movements. Nineteen female athletes participated in a longitudinal study, where lateral reactive jumps (LRJs) and unanticipated cuttings were performed before and after CS training (15 training sessions within 5 weeks) while 3D kinematics and kinetics were measured. In addition, core endurance and power were evaluated. Core stability training increased trunk rotation in the new movement direction (p = 0.02) during LRJ. However, lateral trunk lean was significantly increased during LRJ (from 5.6 to 7°) and cuttings (from 3.8 to 5.8°) after CS training. Knee joint abduction moment was not influenced. Finally, core endurance (p < 0.01) and core power (p < 0.001) were significantly improved after CS training. A 5-week dynamic and functional CS training program improved core muscle endurance and power. This might explain the better trunk rotation toward the new movement direction during LRJ; however, it was not effective during unanticipated cuttings. The practical application of this research will allow strength and conditioning professionals to setup training programs with simple and relevant exercises to increase the core endurance and power of trained individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2960284616,Effects of Neuromuscular Training on Agility Performance in Elite Soccer Players,2019-07-23,2019,article,"Background: Agility in general and change-of-direction speed (CoD) in particular represent important performance determinants in elite soccer. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of a 6-week neuromuscular training program on agility performance, and to determine differences in movement times between the slower and faster turning directions in elite soccer players. Materials and Methods: Twenty male elite soccer players from the Stade Rennais Football Club (Ligue 1, France) participated in this study. The players were randomly assigned to a neuromuscular training group (NTG, n=10) or an active control (CG, n=10) according to their playing position. NTG participated in a 6-week, twice per week neuromuscular training program that included CoD, plyometric and dynamic stability exercises. Neuromuscular training replaced the regular warm-up program. Each training session lasted 30 minutes. CG continued their regular training program. Training volume was similar between groups. Before and after the intervention, the two groups performed a reactive agility test that included 180° left and right body rotations followed by a 5-m linear sprint. The weak side was defined as the left/right turning direction that produced slower overall movement times (MT). Reaction time (RT) was assessed and defined as the time from the first appearance of a visual stimulus until the athlete's first movement. Results: No significant between-group baseline differences were observed for RT or MT. Significant group x time interactions were found for MT (p=0.012, effect size = 0.332, small) for the slower and faster directions (p=0.011, effect size = 0.627, moderate). Significant pre-to post improvements in MT were observed for NTG but not CG (p=0.011, effect size = 0.877, moderate). For NTG, post-hoc analyses revealed significant MT improvements for the slower (p=0.012, effect size = 0.897, moderate) and faster directions (p=0.017, effect size = 0.968, moderate). Conclusions: Our results illustrate that 6 weeks of neuromuscular training with 2 sessions per week included in the warm-up program, significantly enhanced agility performance in elite soccer players. Moreover, improvements were found on both sides during body rotations. Thus, practitioners are advised to focus their training programs on both turning directions."

However, findings across studies are often conflicting in respect to what a movement deficiency is or the magnitude of association to a specific injury. This study tests the information content within movement data using a data driven framework that was taught to classify movement data into the classes: NORM, ACLOP and ACLNO OP, without the input of expert knowledge. The NORM class was presented by 62 subjects (124 NORM limbs), while 156 subjects with ACL reconstruction represented the ACLOP and ACLNO OP class (156 limbs each class). Movement data from jumping, hopping and change of direction exercises were examined, using a variety of machine learning techniques. A stratified shuffle split cross-validation was used to obtain a measure of expected accuracy for each step within the analysis. Classification accuracies (from best performing classifiers) ranged from 52 to 81%, using up to 5 features. The exercise with the highest classification accuracy was the double leg drop jump (DLDJ; 81%), the highest classification accuracy when considering only the NORM class was observed in the single leg hop (81%), while the DLDJ demonstrated the highest classification accuracy when considering only for the ACLOP and ACLNO OP class (84%). These classification accuracies demonstrate that biomechanical data contains valuable information and that it is possible to differentiate normal from rehabilitating movement patterns. Further, findings highlight that a few features contain most of the information, that it is important to seek to understand what a classification model has learned, that symmetry measures are important, that exercises capture different qualities and that not all subjects within a normative cohort utilise 'true' normative movement patterns (only 27 to 71%)."

However, little is known regarding the movement patterns these players perform in sports actions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether visually impaired players present changes in their movement patterns in specific functional tasks compared with sighted amateur football players. Six VI and eight sighted amateur football players performed two functional tasks: (1) 5 m shuttle test and (2) 60 s ball passing against a wall. The sighted players performed the tests while fully sighted (SIG) as well as blindfolded (BFO). During both tasks, full-body kinematics was recorded using an inertial motion capture system. The maximal center-of-mass speed and turning center-of-mass speed were computed during the 5 m shuttle test. Foot resultant speed, bilateral arm speed, and trunk flexion were measured during the 60 s ball passing test. The results showed that VI players achieved lower maximal and turning speed compared to SIG players (p &lt; 0.05), but BFO were slower than the VI players. The VI players presented similar foot contact speed during passes when compared to SIG, but they presented greater arm movement speed (p &lt; 0.05) compared to both SIG and BFO. In addition, VI players presented greater trunk flexion angles while passing when compared to both SIG and BFO (p &lt; 0.05). It is concluded that VI players present slower speed while running and turning, and they adopt specific adaptations from arm movements and trunk flexion to perform passes."

Study protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled single centre trial",2019-07-23,2019,article,"Acute injuries of the hamstring muscle complex (HMC) type 3b (interfascicle/bundle-tear) are frequently observed in various sports disciplines both in elite and recreational sport. The treatment of choice of acute HMC injuries type 3b is a progressive physiotherapeutic exercise programme. Besides this, there is currently only insufficient scientific evidence to support other treatment methods, including local infiltrations and injections of platelet-rich-plasma. Very recently, it was demonstrated that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may accelerate regeneration after acute skeletal muscle injury. The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of radial ESWT (rESWT) and a specific rehabilitation program (RP) is effective and safe in treatment of acute HMC injury type 3b in athletes, and is statistically significantly more effective than the combination of sham-rESWT and RP. We will perform a double blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial at the clinic KinEf Kinesiología Deportiva, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Forty patients with acute HMC injury type 3b will be randomly allocated to receive either rESWT (nine rESWT sessions; three sessions per week; 2500 radial extracorporeal shock waves (rESWs) per session; energy density depending on what the patient tolerates) or sham-rESWT. In addition, all patients will receive a specific rehabilitation program that will last for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the individual time (days) necessary to return to play. Secondary outcomes will include the presence or absence of reinjury during a time period of 6 months after inclusion into the study. Because of the lack of adequate treatment options for acute HMC injury type 3b in athletes and particularly the high reinjury rate, we hypothesize that the results of this trial will be of importance and have impact on clinical practice.

Prevention of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) is an area of emphasis because of the potential for long-term as well as short-term sequelae. Hypothesis: A rule change can lower the incidence of concussions and other injuries in professional baseball. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study included a retrospective review of data entered concurrently into professional baseball’s electronic medical record system. All minor and major league teams are required to use this system. All injuries are captured by creation of a new record in the system at the time of the injury. All active minor and major league players from 2011 to 2017 were included. The 30 major league clubs have 1200 roster players and play 162 games per season. The approximately 200 minor league clubs have about 7500 active players and play 56 to 144 games annually that combine for approximately 330,000 athlete-exposures per season. Before the 2014 season, Major League Baseball, in conjunction with its players association, instituted a rule limiting home plate collisions between base runners and catchers that applied to both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball. All concussions and other injuries at home plate from 2011 to 2017 were analyzed by mechanism and player position. Results: From 2011 to 2013, an annual mean of 100 injuries occurred from home plate collisions in the minor and major leagues, resulting in a mean loss of 2148 days annually. After the rule change, there was a mean 55 home plate collision injuries with 936 days lost per season ( P &lt; .0001 for injuries and days lost). A mean 11 concussions attributed to these collisions occurred annually in the minor and major leagues before the rule change, as compared with 2.3 per year after ( P = .0029). There were no major league concussions from these collisions after the rule change. The mean annual number of days missed because of concussions at home plate dropped from 276 before 2014 to 36 per year after 2014 ( P = .0001). Conclusion: This rule change was associated with significant reductions in the numbers of concussions and other injuries caused by collisions at home plate as well as significant decreases in time lost from play."

PCEs were defined as direct head collision incidents resulting in the athlete being unable to immediately resume play for at least 5 sec following impact. Results A total of 218 incidents were identified in 179 matches (1.22 per match, 36.91 per 1000 hours of exposure). The most common mechanism of PCE was elbow-to-head (28.7%, n=68). The frontal region was the most frequently affected location of impact with 22.8% (n=54). Conclusion Our study defined the identification, prevalence and nature of PCEs in professional international soccer tournaments. Our findings indicate the different contexts and mechanisms of head contact and contact to different regions of the head can be associated with varying signs of concussion. The results highlight targets for future injury prevention strategies."

Knowledge of the peculiarities of anthropometric indicators, body weight components, and somatotype of athletes is important for coaches, sports scientists, and sports physicians at all stages of perennial training, starting with children’s sport. Often this is seen as an important indicator for identifying talented children in sport. The aim of this study was to determine how the anthropometric and body weight profile of young swimmers (11–12 years) significantly changes during the training period, and the correlation of these indicators with the competition results in the chosen event.Methods. The study included 24 young (aged 11.7 ± 0.5 years) national level swimmers – girls (n = 14) and boys (n = 10) with 3 to 4 years of sports experience in the national competitions and demonstrating high results in their age group. We investigated longitudinal anthropometric measurements, body mass components, established the somatotype and handgrip strength. The change of indicators was analysed during the training period of five months as well as its correlation with the result in the chosen sport. Sports results were rated by FINA ranking points.Results. The anthropometric longitudinal and transverse dimensions of girls and boys increased during the study period, however, there was no difference between the sex groups except for the length of the foot (it was higher in the group of boys, p &lt; .05). The analysis of body weight components showed that girls had higher body fat mass and a percentage of body fat than boys (p &lt; .05). The results of boys’ swimming had statistically significant links with their height (r = .857), foot length (r = .805), body weight (r = .857), lean mass and muscle mass (r = .927) and right handgrip strength (.786). There was no significant correlation between these indicators in the group of girls.Conclusion. The results of the study suggest that the characteristics of the anthropometric profile as a prognostic indicator for the viability in the chosen sport for boys were more significant than for girls."

In contrast to physiological loads however, the biomechanical demands of training and competition are still not well understood, primarily due to the difficulty of quantifying biomechanical loads in a field environment. Although musculoskeletal adaptation and injury are known to occur at a tissue level, several biomechanical load metrics are available that quantify loads experienced by the body as a whole, its different structures and the individual tissues that are part of these structures. This paper discusses the distinct aspects and challenges that are associated with measuring biomechanical loads at these different levels in laboratory and/or field contexts. Our hope is that through this paper, sport scientists and practitioners will be able to critically consider the value and limitations of biomechanical load metrics and will keep pursuing new methods to measure these loads within and outside the lab, as a detailed load quantification is essential to better understand the biomechanical load-response pathways that occur in the field."

This review provides an overview of the most recent literature concerning spinal injury epidemiology, mechanisms, patterns and prevention strategies in the context of alpine winter sports. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched using the keywords spine injury, alpine injury, spine fracture, skiing injuries, snowboard injuries. 64 published studies in English and German met a priori inclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail by the authors. There are various mechanisms of injury in alpine winter sports (high speed falls in skiing, jumping failure in snowboarding) whilst regionality and injury severity are broadly similar. The thoracolumbar spine is the most common region for spinal injury. Spinal cord injury is relatively rare, usually accompanying distraction and rotation type fractures and is most commonly localised to the cervical spine. Disc injuries seem to occur more commonly in alpine winter sport athletes than in the general population. Despite awareness of increasing rates and risks of spinal injuries in alpine winter sports, there has been little success in injury prevention."

Here we show how to establish a protocol for reliably and repeatedly inducing a mild awake closed head injury (ACHI) in rats, with no mortality or clinical indications of persistent pain. Moreover, we implement a new rapid neurological assessment protocol (NAP) that can be completely conducted within 1 min of each impact. This ACHI model will help to rectify the paucity of data on how repeated mTBI (r‐mTBI) impacts the juvenile brain, an area of significant concern in clinical populations where there is evidence that behavioral sequelae following injury can be more persistent in juveniles. In addition, the ACHI model can help determine if r‐mTBI early in life can predispose the brain to exhibiting greater neuropathology (i.e., chronic traumatic encephalopathy) later in life and can facilitate the identification of critical periods of vulnerability to r‐mTBI across the lifespan. This article describes the protocol for administering an awake closed head mTBI (i.e., ACHI) to rats, as well as how to perform a rapid NAP following each ACHI. Methods for administering the ACHI to individual subjects repeatedly are described, as are the methods and scoring system for the NAP. The goal of this article is to provide a standardized set of procedures allowing the ACHI and NAP protocols to be used reliably by different laboratories. © 2019 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc."

The aim of our study was to examine the effect of intermittent running on bone turnover markers using altered exercise‐to‐rest intervals. Twelve males completed one control (no exercise), and three, 45‐min intermittent protocols (5, 20, and 80 s intervals) matched for distance and speed. Fasted venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 1, 2 and 24 h post‐exercise. Carboxyterminal crosslinked telopeptide (CTX‐I) and procollagen type 1 amino‐terminal propeptide (P1NP) were used as markers of bone resorption and formation. After adjustment for baseline, CTX‐I concentration at 1 h was higher (very likely to most likely small) for 5 s (30.2%; ±90% confidence limits: 10%), 20 s (2.9.0%; ±10%) and 80 s (32.0%; ±10%) compared to control. The very likely small effect remained for 5 s at 2 h (30.2%; ±15%). The effect for 20 and 80 s was possibly trivial and possibly small/possibly trivial (∼14.5%; ±∼15%). Differences in P1NP concentrations were likely to very likely trivial (∼7.4%; ±∼7.6%). Circulating CTX‐I concentration is affected acutely by intermittent running with short‐interval (5 s) intermittent loading resulting in a prolonged attenuation in circadian rhythm of CTX‐I up to 2 h that was not demonstrated as clearly by longer intervals despite matched internal and external training load."

However, teams continue to face challenges that characteristically align with those of amateur sport in addressing recruiting and retaining athletes. The purpose of this study was to examine the challenges elite, competitive wheelchair basketball programs face and to understand their approach to recruiting and retaining athletes with disabilities to play the sport. Green’s (2005) theory of sport development was chosen as the lens for this study because of its focus on establishment of a sport for sustainability through athlete participation. An online open-ended questionnaire was sent to all 139 NWBA team contacts, with 28 responses representing multiple divisions within the league. Findings revealed that teams were primarily formed through unstable means of personal interest and community needs as well as stable means of university and rehabilitation hospital systems. Participants identified funding as the biggest challenge as they offered little support for tournament travel or financial rewards for athletes. Teams recruited athletes through social connections and community presence, but offered little structure for their means of retaining athletes. These findings show the NWBA teams operate with challenges akin to amateur sport due to uncertainty of funding and athlete sustainability."

It is considered a ""multisystemic"" disease with many potential mechanisms responsible for its pathology. Currently, there is no cure for ALS. Exercise training is suggested as a potential approach to reduce ALS pathology, but its beneficial role remains controversial. This review provides an overview of the effects of exercise training in ALS-affected mice and patients. It will compare the intensity, duration and type of exercise on the health of SOD1G93A mice, a mouse model of familial ALS, and review clinical studies involving ALS patients undergoing both endurance and resistance training. In summary, mild-to-moderate swimming-based endurance training appears the most advantageous mode of exercise in SOD1G93A mice, improving animal survival and delaying the onset and progression of disease. Furthermore, clinical studies show that both endurance and resistance training have an advantageous impact on the quality of life of ALS patients without extending life expectancy. However, small sample sizes, non-representative control populations, heterogeneous disease stage of patients and the presence of confounders often exist in the exercise studies conducted with ALS patients. This raises concerns about the interpretation of these findings and, therefore, these results should be considered with caution. While promising, more pre-clinical and clinical studies with improved experimental design and fewer limitations are still necessary to confirm the impact of exercise training on the health of ALS patients."

MethodsWe asked 19,261 participants to complete a demographic questionnaire and 12 cognitive tests measuring aspects of executive function, including inhibitory control. We compared the performance of those reporting a history of concussion (post-concussion) to those reporting no history of concussion (non-concussed) on the cognitive battery and four non-cognitive variables. We used the results of this population-level study to predict the profile of cognitive performance in varsity American football players, who completed the same cognitive tasks. ResultsPost-concussion and non-concussed participants did not differ on 11 of the 12 cognitive tasks employed. However, on a test of inhibitory control based on the classic Stroop paradigm, post-concussion participants showed accuracy-related impairments specific to the incongruent conditions of the task. Post-concussion participants reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and trouble concentrating. An entirely independent sample of 74 varsity American football players demonstrated the same pattern of impairment: compared to healthy controls, they scored significantly lower on the test of inhibitory control but were indistinguishable from controls on the 11 other tasks.InterpretationSelf-reported concussion is not associated with long-term general effects on cognitive function. Nevertheless, those who report at least one concussion and those who expose themselves to long-term frequent sport-related head impacts, do have a modest, but statistically robust, deficit of inhibitory control."

Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a novel thermoplastic polymer with high biocompatibility and mechanical properties that mimic native bone, and it can be imaged on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without signal flare. Purpose: To compare the clinical performance of ACL reconstruction with PEEK and titanium interference screws at 2 years and to evaluate a novel method of measuring tunnel volume. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 133 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with 4-strand hamstring autografts and were randomized to have titanium or PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial tunnel fixation. At 2 years, subjective Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores were assessed and clinical examination performed. At 12 months, MRI was performed to assess graft incorporation and cyst formation, and a novel technique was employed to measure tunnel volumes. Results: There were no significant differences in graft rerupture rate, contralateral ACL rupture rate, subjective outcomes, or objective outcomes. In the titanium and PEEK groups, MRI demonstrated high overall rates of graft integration (96%-100% and 90%-93%, respectively) and ligamentization (89% and 84%) and low rates of synovitis (22% and 10%) and cyst formation (0%-18% and 13%-15%). There was a higher proportion of patients with incomplete graft integration within the femoral tunnel in the PEEK group as compared with the titanium group (10% vs 0%, P = .03); however, the authors suggest that metal artifact precluded proper assessment of the graft in the titanium group by MRI. Tunnel volumes also appeared to be equivalent in the 2 groups and were measured with a novel technique that was highly reproducible in the PEEK group secondary to the absence of flare. Conclusion: Two-year clinical analysis of PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial fixation of ACL reconstructions showed equivalent clinical performance to titanium interference screws. Given the excellent mechanical characteristics, biological compatibility, and absence of metal artifact on MRI, PEEK has become our material of choice for interference screw fixation in ACL reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2962230031,Injury Surveillance in Major League Soccer: A 4-Year Comparison of Injury on Natural Grass Versus Artificial Turf Field,2019-07-15,2019,article,"Background: Artificial playing surfaces are becoming more common due to decreased cost of maintenance and increased field usability across different environmental conditions. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has approved newer generation artificial turf for soccer competition at the elite level, but many elite-level athletes prefer to play on natural grass surfaces due to a perceived increase in injury rate, discomfort, and fatigability on artificial turf. Hypothesis: Injury rates and rates of individually categorized types of injury experienced on artificial turf are noninferior to rates of injury on the standard comparator, natural grass, in elite-level Major League Soccer athletes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Over the course of 4 Major League Soccer seasons (2013-2016), athlete injury data were recorded electronically. Injury data recorded in matches between 2 Major League Soccer teams were then analyzed. Playing surface was known for each venue, and all artificial turf surfaces were rated as 2-star according to FIFA criteria. Incidence rate ratios (Artificial Turf ÷ Natural Grass) were calculated with a 95% CI (α = .05) for both overall injury incidence and individual injury subgroups. A noninferiority margin (δ) of 0.15 was used to determine noninferiority of injury incidence rates. Results: A total of 2174 in-game injuries were recorded during the study period, with 1.54 injuries per game on artificial turf and 1.49 injuries per game on natural grass (incidence rate ratio, 1.033; 95% CI, 0.937-1.139). Within injury subgroups, overall ankle injury, Achilles injury, and ankle fracture were found to have a statistically higher incidence on artificial turf. Artificial turf was found to be noninferior to natural grass for overall foot injury and forefoot injury. No statistically significant differences were found in knee injuries between the 2 surfaces. Conclusion: The overall rate of injury on artificial turf was noninferior to that on natural grass. Within individual injury categories, a higher rate of ankle injury was found on artificial turf. No other injury subgroup demonstrated statistically significant differences between surfaces. Clinical Relevance: FIFA 2-star rated artificial turf is a viable alternative to natural grass in elite-level soccer competition. Innovative research methods for comparing artificial turf versus natural grass may elucidate relative advantages with respect to player safety."

We argue there is a lack of business competition because franchises are simultaneous co-producers, collaborators, buyers, and suppliers. Consequently, mainstream strategic management frameworks that rely on competitive environments are ill-equipped to evaluate the nuances of spectator sport. In response to these observations, we develop multiple new and modified frameworks, including a spectator sport supply chain that inextricably links the participatory and spectator sport segments. Through this hierarchy of training, participants evolve from paying customers to inputs to production. Spectator sport and its supply chain are then positioned in the center of a revised industry model to develop a theory of spectatoritis, which is a rational explanation for why spectator sport is not only a natural focus for research, but also furnishes considerable promise for the development of unique sport management theory."

Study Protocol for a Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled Single Centre Trial",2019-07-14,2019,preprint,"Background: Acute injuries of the hamstring muscle complex (HMC) Type 3b (interfascicle / bundle-tear) are frequently observed in various sports disciplines both in elite and recreational sport. The treatment of choice of acute HMC injuries Type 3b is a progressive physiotherapeutic exercise program. Besides this, there is currently only insufficient scientific evidence to support other treatment methods, including local infiltrations and injections of platelet-rich-plasma. Very recently it was demonstrated that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may accelerate regeneration after acute skeletal muscle injury. The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of radial ESWT (rESWT) and a specific rehabilitation program (RP) is effective and safe in treatment of acute HMC injury Type 3b in athletes, and is statistically significantly more effective than the combination of sham-rESWT and RP. Methods/Design: We will perform a double blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial at the clinic KinEf Kinesiolog&amp;iacute;a Deportiva, Ciudad Aut&amp;oacute;noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Fourty patients with acute HMC injury Type 3b will be randomly allocated to receive either rESWT (nine rESWT sessions; three sessions per week; 2500 radial extracorporeal shock waves (rESWs) per session; energy density depending on what the patient tolerates) or sham-rESWT. In addition, all patients will receive a specific rehabilitation program that will last for eight weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the individual time (days) necessary to return to play. Secondary outcomes will include the presence or absence of reinjury during a time period of six months after inclusion into the study. Discussion: Because of the lack of adequate treatment options for acute HMC injury Type 3b in athletes and particularly the high reinjury rate, we hypothesize that the results of this trial will be of importance and have impact on clinical practice.

Muscle injury classification systems aim to provide a framework for diagnosis. The British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification (BAMIC) describes an MRI classification system with clearly defined, anatomically focused classes based on the site of injury: (a) myofascial, (b) muscle-tendon junction or (c) intratendinous; and the extent of the injury, graded from 0 to 4. However, there are no clinical guidelines that link the specific diagnosis (as above) with a focused rehabilitation plan.We present an overview of the general principles of, and rationale for, exercise-based hamstring injury rehabilitation in British Athletics. We describe how British Athletics clinicians use the BAMIC to help manage elite track and field athletes with hamstring injury. Within each class of injury, we discuss four topics: clinical presentation, healing physiology, how we prescribe and progress rehabilitation and how we make the shared decision to return to full training. We recommend a structured and targeted diagnostic and rehabilitation approach to improve outcomes after hamstring injury."

While the mechanics and neurophysiology of turns have been extensively studied in laboratory conditions, modern inertial measurement units allow us to monitor athletes directly on the field. In this study, we applied four supervised machine learning techniques (linear regression, support vector regression/machine, boosted decision trees and artificial neural networks) to predict turn direction, speed (before/after turn) and the related positive/negative mechanical work. Reference values were computed using an optical motion capture system. We collected data from 13 elite female soccer players performing a shuttle run test, wearing a six-axes inertial sensor at the pelvis level. A set of 18 features (predictors) were obtained from accelerometers, gyroscopes and barometer readings. Turn direction classification returned good results (accuracy &gt; 98.4%) with all methods. Support vector regression and neural networks obtained the best performance in the estimation of positive/negative mechanical work (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.42–0.43, mean absolute error = 1.14–1.41 J) and running speed before/after the turns (R2 = 0.66–0.69, mean absolute error = 0.15–018 m/s). Although models can be extended to different angles, we showed that meaningful information on turn kinematics and energetics can be obtained from inertial units with a data-driven approach."

The most commonly injured joint in male and female football players is the knee joint. It has been reported that approximately 60-85% of football injuries occur in the lower limbs. The aim of this study is to present the methods of biomechanical assessment of lower limbs joint loading during specific tasks (single leg squat (SLS) and single leg landing (SLL)). In this experimental setup, Qualisys Tracking Motion system synchronised with AMTII force plates embedded into the floor was used. The marker setup Salford Lower Limb model was used to track pelvis and lower body movements. By analysing biomechanical parameters (range of motion, internal moments, power, ground reaction forces) in all three planes it is possible to identify the structures and the imbalances of the lower extremity that need intervention and further decrease the possibility of injury to the knee and to evaluate an appropriate moment of return to play. This method showed a very high reproducibility and it can be considered as a reliable tool in assessing lower limb performance tasks."

They are a common injury in female athletes and often cause significant morbidity. The goal of this study is to review the presentation, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prevention of SFx in female athletes.Results: A thorough history, physical exam, and appropriate imaging can facilitate early diagnosis of stress fracture (SFx) and faster resolution of symptoms with more conservative management. The female athlete triad is an especially important factor that contributes to the increased risk of SFx in females. The continuum of stress injuries ranges from mild microfailure to complete fracture, which has resulted in the development of newer grading schemas through MRI and radiographic findings. Stress fractures are also classified as low- or high-risk according to anatomic location, as blood supply and applied forces at different locations affect the likelihood of fracture propagation, displacement, delayed union, or non-union.Conclusions: The ability to screen for at-risk athletes is paramount in preventing SFx. Recognition and prompt treatment of the female athlete triad requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to restore energy balance, correct menstrual irregularities, and improve bone health. This review provides a basis for understanding how to identify and treat stress fractures, which may allow treating physicians to diagnose this condition earlier and minimize any associated morbidity."

While pigs have been used for various biomedical applications and research, it has only been recently that they have been used to study neurodegenerative diseases due to their neuroanatomically similar gyrencephalic brains and similar neurophysiological processes as seen in humans. This review focuses on the use of pigs in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). AD is considered the most common neurodegenerative disease in elderly populations. Head impacts from falls are the most common form of injury in the elderly and recent literature has shown an association between repetitive head impacts and the development of AD. This review summarizes research into the pathological mechanisms underlying AD and TBI as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using pigs in the neuroscientific study of these disease processes. With the lack of successful therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, and an increasing elderly population, the use of pigs may provide a better translational model for understanding and treating these diseases."

The purpose of this study was to determine differences return to play (RTP) rate, career length, and performance-based outcomes after a patellar tendon repair in professional athletes of four different sports.Methods: Participants met inclusion criteria if initial reports of the date and type of surgery were corroborated by at least two independent sources of information through a well-established protocol of public newspaper archives, team injury reports, and player profiles. Players with other concomitant injuries of the knee or treated nonoperatively were excluded. One hundred and three athletes across professional baseball, basketball, American football, and soccer athletes were identified and met inclusion criteria. RTP rate, career length, and sports-specific performance statistics (i.e. player efficiency rating (PER) for professional basketball players) before and after surgery were collected for each athlete.Results: Seventy-nine (76.7%) professional athletes successfully RTP. American football athletes had the lowest RTP rate and the largest drop in performance in post-operative season 1 (P < 0.001). These athletes also experienced the shortest adjusted career lengths (P = 0.003) compared to players in the other sports. Basketball athletes played significantly less games through post-operative seasons 1 to 3 (P < 0.05). Soccer athletes had less goals and assists per game and played fewer games (P < 0.05) in post-operative season 1 that recovered to baseline by seasons 2 and 3.Conclusion: A patellar tendon rupture is a potentially devastating injury for the professional athlete. American football players appeared to have the worst postoperative outcome with the lowest RTP rate and a most significant decrease in performance in the first postoperative season. This procedure also had a significant short-term impact on soccer athletes who sustained decreases in short-term game performance. These findings are likely explained by the unique physical demands imposed by each sport."

However, the correlations between these factors and lower extremity muscle activation during the flight phase, which may affect these factors, are unknown. Objectives: The present study aimed to clarify the correlations between the peak vertical ground reaction force (pVGRF), sagittal joint angles during the landing phase, and the vastus medialis (VM) and semitendinosus (ST) muscle co-contraction index (CCI) during the flight phase in single-leg jump-landing. Methods: Fourteen healthy, physically active volunteers (age, 22.6 ± 2.7 years; height, 164.4 ± 7.6 cm; body weight, 58.9 ± 8.9 kg; body mass index, 21.7 ± 2.3 kg/m2) participated. All subjects performed a single-leg jump-landing task. The pVGRF variables and the sagittal joint angles during the landing phase were measured. The CCI between the VM and ST during the flight phase was measured. The correlations between the VGRF variables, sagittal joint angles, and CCI were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The knee flexion angle at the pVGRF was negatively correlated with the magnitude of pVGRF (ρ = -0.609, P = 0.021). The knee flexion angle at the pVGRF was negatively correlated with the CCI during the flight phase in single-leg jump-landing (ρ = -0.627, P = 0.016). Conclusions: An excessive CCI between the VM and ST during the flight phase might be indirectly related to a greater landing impact after a single-leg jump."

Although postmortem analysis is currently the only confirmatory method to diagnose CTE, there has been progress in early detection techniques of fluid biomarkers as well as in advanced neuroimaging techniques. Specifically, promising new methods of diffusion MRI and radionucleotide PET scans could aid in the early detection of CTE. The authors examine early detection methods focusing on various neuroimaging techniques. Advances in structural and diffusion MRI have demonstrated the ability to measure volumetric and white matter abnormalities associated with CTE. Recent studies using radionucleotides such as flortaucipir and 18F-FDDNP have shown binding patterns that are consistent with the four stages of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) distribution postmortem. Additional research undertakings focusing on fMRI, MR spectroscopy, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and singlephoton emission CT are also discussed as are advanced MRI methods such as diffusiontensor imaging and arterial spin labeled. Neuroimaging is fast becoming a key instrument in early detection and could prove essential for CTE quantification. This review explores a global approach to in vivo early detection. Limited data of in vivo CTE biomarkers with postmortem confirmation are available. While some data exist, they are limited by selection bias. It is unlikely that a single test will be sufficient to properly diagnosis and distinguish CTE from other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease or Frontotemporal Dementia. However, with a combination of fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging, and genetic testing, early detection may become possible."

INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW[Vol.16:251 sexual dimorphism that make them respond differently to their environment causing disparities in health and health care. 1 These differences are present across organ systems throughout the whole body; yet women's health research and regulation have historically focused on ""women's health issues"" as those related to the reproductive system (e.g., childbirth) or ""women's diseases"" (e.g., breast cancer) with the assumption that sex differences in other organ systems could be explained by differences in height, weight, etc. 2 Biological, psychological, socioeconomic, and cultural factors interact to cause differences in health and health care for men and women. 3Recognition of sex-based differences in the medical needs of patients leads to improvement of health care delivery and outcomes. 4Medical teaching, treatment, and research outside of reproductive medicine have traditionally been gender-neutral 5 2019] SEX-BASED DISPARITIES IN MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH CARE 253-especially in fields like musculoskeletal medicine.Failure to adjust medical care based on sex can lead to disparities, especially among women. 6 Many musculoskeletal diseases and injuries have sex-based differences.Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, osteoarthritis, ankle sprains, osteoporosis, hip & wrist fractures, spinal disorders, severe scoliosis, and many other musculoskeletal problems are more prevalent among women than men. 7 Sexbased differences in injury mechanism, pain sensation, drug handling by the body, and healing responses have also been noted and can lead to differences in responses to treatments like surgery, anesthesia, pain medication, pharmaceuticals, and rehabilitation. 8Therefore, health care professionals need to be ""sex sensitive"" to optimally treat both sexes. 9 Law and policy measures can sometimes unintentionally complicate medical care by making medical professionals uneasy and perhaps less likely to acknowledge or address non-obvious sex-based differences to avoid the appearance of sex stereotyping or of treating the sexes unequally in a socially and politically charged environment.Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") ""prohibits discrimination on the grounds of . . .sex . . . in certain health programs and activities"" with the ""final rule appl[ying] to any health program or activity, any part of which receives funding from"" entities funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS""), like Medicare and Medicaid 10 -virtually including all health care activities, including doctor and hospital interactions with patients.""The rule makes clear that sex discrimination prohibited under Section 1557 11 includes discrimination based on . . .sex stereotyping."" 12 Sex stereotypes means stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity, including expectations of how individuals represent or communicate their clinical practice guidelines remain gender neutral failing to cover gender issues related to diagnosis/treatment).For problems with gender neutral medicine, see infra pp.19-26.6."

This retrospective observational study analyzed 84 male patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction from 2015 to 2018. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 6 weeks of injury. Bone bruise, tendon, ligament, meniscal, and muscle injuries were evaluated. The surgery was performed within 3 months after the injury. Detailed arthroscopic findings (chondral, meniscal, and ligamentous injuries) were documented intraoperatively. The weight and height were used to quantify BMI (weight in kg/height in m2). Of the 84 male patients, 58 had associated articular injuries. The median age of the study population was 24 years (minimum: 17 years, maximum: 43 years) years. The mean BMI, height, and weight were 27.12 ± 0.78 kg/m2, 1.73 ± 0.01 m, and 81.17 ± 21.52 kg, respectively. The relationship between higher BMI and associated articular injuries (95% confidence interval [CI]) was statistically significant (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant relationship between weight and associated articular injuries (p = 0.003). Height and age were not predictive factors. Higher BMI and weight were significant risk factors for associated articular injuries in the presence of ACL tear. Height was not found to be a predictive factor. Higher BMI was associated with increased risk of medial and/or lateral meniscus tears and bone bruising."
https://openalex.org/W2979304393,Cluster analysis successfully identifies clinically meaningful knee valgus moment patterns: Frequency of early peaks reflects sex-specific ACL injury incidence,2019-07-08,2019,preprint,"Abstract Background Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors report heterogenous results, analyze only a fraction of the data, and do not analyze data in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing of the peak value. Aims/Hypotheses The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be an early peak pattern, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have higher early peak frequencies. Methods N=213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N=35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared test. Results 6 discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P&lt;0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P&lt;0.001 for full test). Conclusions Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Higher frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher incidence of ACL injury."

To ensure the effective coordination of the shared effort, each task must be decomposed into a sequence of atomic actions that can be assigned either to a single agent or to the combination of more agents, according to a defined metric. While task allocation is a general problem and has been discussed intensively in other fields, less effort has been devoted in industrial scenarios, involving mixed human–robot teams and in particular, to the factors that should be considered in allocating tasks among a heterogeneous set of agents in collaborative manufacturing scenarios. In this letter, we investigate the agent characteristics that should be considered in the task allocation problem of fast-reconfigurable systems in industrial assembly processes. First, we introduce a set of indices, namely task complexity, agent dexterity, and agent effort, to evaluate agent performance with respect to a task. Second, we propose an offline allocation algorithm that combines the performance indices to assign optimally the task to the team agents. Finally, we validate the framework in a proof-of-concept collaborative assembly of a metallic structure. The results show that the workload is shared through the agents according to their particular physical capabilities and skill levels. A subjective analysis of the proposed collaborative framework on 12 healthy participants also validated the intuitiveness-of-use and improved performance."

Eighty-one professional basketball and soccer athletes participated, each performing three CMJs on a force platform. Inferential parametric and nonparametric statistics were performed to explore group differences. Binary logistic regression was used to model the response variable (soccer or not soccer). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was reached for differences between groups in maximum braking rate of force development (RFDDmax, U79 = 1035), mean braking rate of force development (RFDDavg, U79 = 1038), propulsive impulse (IMPU, t79 = 2.375), minimum value of vertical displacement for center of mass (SBCMmin, t79 = 3.135), and time difference (% of impulse time; ΔΤ) between the peak value of maximum force value (FUmax) and SBCMmin (U79 = 1188). Logistic regression showed that RFDDavg, impulse during the downward phase (IMPD), IMPU, and ΔΤ were all significant predictors. The model showed that soccer group membership could be strongly related to IMPU, with the odds ratio being 6.48 times higher from the basketball group, whereas RFDDavg, IMPD, and ΔΤ were related to basketball group. The results imply that soccer players execute CMJ differently compared to basketball players, exhibiting increased countermovement depth and impulse generation during the propulsive phase."

Participants were 73 male rugby players, 52 professional players and 21 semi-professional players. All participants completed the NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory (NEO-FFI) as part of the WebNeuro Sport online assessment. An independent sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference in neuroticism between the professional and semi-professional players. The magnitude-based inference method confirmed the results of the independent sample t-test with a moderate effect. The potential practical value of these findings is that the Neuroticism scale of the Big Five personality dimensions can be used as a screening tool for indicating which players a team would want to recruit and invest time and money in since these players will most likely be capable of progressing to the top level in their sport."

A better understanding of the techniques of AI employed and of the sports that are using AI is clearly warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify which AI approaches have been applied to investigate sport performance and injury risk and to find out which AI techniques each sport has been using. Systematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases were conducted for articles reporting AI techniques or methods applied to team sports athletes. Fifty-eight studies were included in the review with 11 AI techniques or methods being applied in 12 team sports. Pooled sample consisted of 6456 participants (97% male, 25 ± 8 years old; 3% female, 21 ± 10 years old) with 76% of them being professional athletes. The AI techniques or methods most frequently used were artificial neural networks, decision tree classifier, support vector machine, and Markov process with good performance metrics for all of them. Soccer, basketball, handball, and volleyball were the team sports with more applications of AI. The results of this review suggest a prevalent application of AI methods in team sports based on the number of published studies. The current state of development in the area proposes a promising future with regard to AI use in team sports. Further evaluation research based on prospective methods is warranted to establish the predictive performance of specific AI techniques and methods."

Purpose: To identify the risk factors and outcomes of AT ruptures in NBA athletes. Furthermore, using video analysis, to characterize the mechanisms of rupture by identifying the most common playing situations and lower extremity positions at the time of injury. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: AT ruptures in the NBA that occurred between the seasons of 1969-1970 and 2017-2018 were identified. Player data collected included age, position, body mass index, total games started before and after injury, and Player Efficiency Rating. Injury-related variables collected included date of injury, laterality, minutes played before injury, operative versus nonoperative treatment, and time to return to play. Available video footage was analyzed for the mechanism and body position at the time of injury. Univariable and multivariable linear regression was used to compare changes in performance before and after AT rupture. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. Results: Forty-four ruptures were identified between 1970 and 2018. The mean age was 28.3 years, with players averaging 6.8 seasons before AT rupture. AT ruptures were most prevalent during early-season game play (27.3%), followed by preseason (18.2%) and late season (18.2%). More than a third (36.8%) of players either did not return to play or started in fewer than 10 games in the remainder of their career, with 21% of ruptures leading to retirement. The mean time to return to play was 10.5 months. The Player Efficiency Rating declined by an average of 2.9 points (range, –11.5 to +2.3) ( P &lt; .001). Analysis of available injury footage (n = 12) demonstrated all ruptures to be noncontact in nature, most commonly occurring just before takeoff as the player began to push off from a stopped position, with the foot in dorsiflexion, the knee in early flexion, and the hip in extension. Conclusion: In the NBA, a majority of AT ruptures occur early in the season, in veteran players, with almost half not returning to play or starting fewer than 10 games in the remainder of their career. The most common mechanism of injury is taking off from a stopped position just before toe-off in a dorsiflexed foot."

Biomechanical associates of performance and knee joint loads during a 70-90° cutting maneuver in subelite soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 35(11): 3190-3198, 2021-The aim of this study was to explore the ""performance-injury risk"" conflict during cutting, by examining whole-body joint kinematics and kinetics that are responsible for faster change-of-direction (COD) performance of a cutting task in soccer players, and to determine whether these factors relate to peak external multiplanar knee moments. 34 male soccer players (age: 20 ± 3.2 years; body mass: 73.5 ± 9.2 kg; height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m) were recruited to investigate the relationships between COD kinetics and kinematics with performance and multiplanar knee joint moments during cutting. Three-dimensional motion data using 10 Qualisys Oqus 7 infrared cameras (240 Hz) and ground reaction force data from 2 AMTI force platforms (1,200 Hz) were collected to analyze the penultimate foot contact and final foot contact (FFC). Pearson's or Spearman's correlations coefficients revealed performance time (PT), peak external knee abduction moment (KAM), and peak external knee rotation moment (KRM) were all significantly related (p < 0.05) to horizontal approach velocity (PT: ρ = -0.579; peak KAM: ρ = 0.414; peak KRM: R = -0.568) and FFC peak hip flexor moment (PT: ρ = 0.418; peak KAM: ρ = -0.624; peak KRM: ρ = 0.517). Performance time was also significantly (p < 0.01) associated with horizontal exit velocity (ρ = -0.451) and, notably, multiplanar knee joint loading (peak KAM: ρ = -0.590; peak KRM: ρ = 0.525; peak KFM: ρ = -0.509). Cohen's d effect sizes (d) revealed that faster performers demonstrated significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 1.1-1.7) multiplanar knee joint loading, as well as significantly greater (p < 0.05; d = 0.9-1.2) FFC peak hip flexor moments, PFC average horizontal GRFs, and peak knee adduction angles. To conclude, mechanics associated with faster cutting performance seem to be ""at odds"" with lower multiplanar knee joint loads. This highlights the potential performance-injury conflict present during cutting."

METHODS Participants completed multiple sets of unilateral leg presses combining ankle, knee, and hip extension and flexion movements against resistance at a pace of 1.2 Hz while lying supine in a 3T MRI scanner. Regions of Interest (ROI) consisted of regions primarily involved in lower extremity motor control (right and left primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum). RESULTS The group analysis based on mixed effects paired samples t‐test revealed no differences for brain activity between sessions ( P &gt; .05). Intraclass correlation coefficients in the sensorimotor regions were good to excellent for average percent signal change (.621 to .918) and Z‐score (.697 to .883), with the exception of the left secondary somatosensory cortex percent signal change (.165). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that a loaded lower extremity force production and attenuation task that simulates the range of motion of squatting, stepping, and landing from a jump is reliable for longitudinal neuroimaging applications and support the use of this paradigm in further studies examining therapeutic interventions and changes in dynamic lower extremity motor function."

In most cases, ACL injuries do not require external contact and they are associated with biomechanical risk factors that increase ACL tension. The increase of the hip flexion angle (HF) is included within these. The ACL requires cooperation of the periarticular musculature of the knee, muscle groups, hip stabilizers and CORE muscles; consequently, fatigue caused by exercise would alter the balance and put this ligament at risk. The objective of the study is to determine the angular behavior for HF before and after a physical load (a standardized training) in children between 11 and 12 years old. A non-randomized clinical study was carried out. The sample consisted of 50 soccer school students born between 11 and 12 years old. The angular behavior of HF was compared before and after performing a training session. The angular behavior was measured through the Drop Jump test (DJ), with data obtained by inertial sensors. After the exercise, there was a significant increase in HF. It was concluded that the angular behavior of HF increases significantly in both extremities after training and that preventive measures must be applied for neuromuscular control of the hip."

Most ACL injuries do not require external contact and are associated with biomechanical risk factors that stress this ligament ACL: like an increase in knee valgus angle (KV) and hip flexion (HF) and a decreased in knee flexion (KF). The ACL requires muscle cooperation to resist the load; however, when there is fatigue, the protective capacity of the musculature would decrease. The objective of the study is to analyze the angular behavior before and after a physical load for HF in children of 14-15 years old. Hypothesis The physical load applied in a single training session is enough to change some biomechanical risk factors of ACL injury. Study Design Experimental study Level of Evidence 2b Methods The sample consisted of 50 students from different soccer schools between 14-15 years old. We analyzed the hip angular behavior of hip flexion before and after a training session. The angles where obtained from inertioal sensor while the students performed a Drop Jump test from a 30 centimeters drawer. Results Statistically significant differences were found in the differences between pre physical load HF / post-load HF (p = 0.00053), right pre physical load HF / right post- load HF (p = 0.0086) and left post- load (p = 0.0248206). Conclusions It was concluded that the angular behavior of HF increases significantly in both post-training limbs, after performing a physical load.

https://openalex.org/W2954178889,Lisfranc fracture-dislocations: current management,2019-07-01,2019,review,"It is essential to know and understand the anatomy of the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint (Lisfranc joint) to achieve a correct diagnosis and proper treatment of the injuries that occur at that level. Up to 20% of Lisfranc fracture-dislocations go unnoticed or are diagnosed late, especially low-energy injuries or purely ligamentous injuries. Severe sequelae such as post-traumatic osteoarthritis and foot deformities can create serious disability. We must be attentive to the clinical and radiological signs of an injury to the Lisfranc joint and expand the study with weight-bearing radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scans. Only in stable lesions and in those without displacement is conservative treatment indicated, along with immobilisation and initial avoidance of weight-bearing. Through surgical treatment we seek to achieve two objectives: optimal anatomical reduction, a factor that directly influences the results; and the stability of the first, second and third cuneiform-metatarsal joints. There are three main controversies regarding the surgical treatment of Lisfranc injuries: osteosynthesis versus primary arthrodesis; transarticular screws versus dorsal plates; and the most appropriate surgical approach. The surgical treatment we prefer is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with transarticular screws or with dorsal plates in cases of comminution of metatarsals or cuneiform bones.

https://openalex.org/W2957901458,An Anterior Cruciate Ligament Failure Mechanism,2019-07-01,2019,article,"Background: Nearly three-quarters of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur as “noncontact” failures from routine athletic maneuvers. Recent in vitro studies revealed that repetitive strenuous submaximal knee loading known to especially strain the ACL can lead to its fatigue failure, often at the ACL femoral enthesis. Hypothesis: ACL failure can be caused by accumulated tissue fatigue damage: specifically, chemical and structural evidence of this fatigue process will be found at the femoral enthesis of ACLs from tested cadaveric knees, as well as in ACL explants removed from patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: One knee from each of 7 pairs of adult cadaveric knees were repetitively loaded under 4 times–body weight simulated pivot landings known to strain the ACL submaximally while the contralateral, unloaded knee was used as a comparison. The chemical and structural changes associated with this repetitive loading were characterized at the ACL femoral enthesis at multiple hierarchical collagen levels by employing atomic force microscopy (AFM), AFM–infrared spectroscopy, molecular targeting with a fluorescently labeled collagen hybridizing peptide, and second harmonic imaging microscopy. Explants from ACL femoral entheses from the injured knee of 5 patients with noncontact ACL failure were also characterized via similar methods. Results: AFM–infrared spectroscopy and collagen hybridizing peptide binding indicate that the characteristic molecular damage was an unraveling of the collagen molecular triple helix. AFM detected disruption of collagen fibrils in the forms of reduced topographical surface thickness and the induction of ~30- to 100-nm voids in the collagen fibril matrix for mechanically tested samples. Second harmonic imaging microscopy detected the induction of ~10- to 100-µm regions where the noncentrosymmetric structure of collagen had been disrupted. These mechanically induced changes, ranging from molecular to microscale disruption of normal collagen structure, represent a previously unreported aspect of tissue fatigue damage in noncontact ACL failure. Confirmatory evidence came from the explants of 5 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, which exhibited the same pattern of molecular, nanoscale, and microscale structural damage detected in the mechanically tested cadaveric samples. Conclusion: The authors found evidence of accumulated damage to collagen fibrils and fibers at the ACL femoral enthesis at the time of surgery for noncontact ACL failure. This tissue damage was similar to that found in donor knees subjected in vitro to repetitive 4 times–body weight impulsive 3-dimensional loading known to cause a fatigue failure of the ACL. Clinical Relevance: These findings suggest that some ACL injuries may be due to an exacerbation of preexisting hierarchical tissue damage from activities known to place larger-than-normal loads on the ACL. Too rapid an increase in these activities could cause ACL tissue damage to accumulate across length scales, thereby affecting ACL structural integrity before it has time to repair. Prevention necessitates an understanding of how ACL loading magnitude and frequency are anabolic, neutral, or catabolic to the ligament."

Objective To identify the time segments across a competitive season or within an individual competition associated with the greatest ACL injury incidence. Design Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods Data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program for 2004–2005 through 2015–2016 for basketball, lacrosse, and soccer were analyzed. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) compared ACL injury rates by sport, sex, season segment, and competition period. Poisson regression was used to examine the associations between each of these categories and the incidence of ACL injury as well as interaction effects. Results During the early regular season, the incidence rate was elevated relative to the preseason (IRR = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27, 2.74), middle regular season (IRR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.15), late regular season (IRR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.27), and postseason (IRR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.06, 4.56). A sport-by-season interaction indicated this effect was largely attributable to a higher incidence in the early season among lacrosse athletes. An interaction between season segment and competition period (P = .02) revealed a greater injury incidence before halftime in the early regular season (IRR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.76), but a greater incidence after halftime in the late regular season (IRR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.15, 5.02). Fewer noncontact injuries occurred in soccer than in basketball or lacrosse. Conclusions The ACL injury incidence was higher in the early part of the regular season, particularly among lacrosse athletes. Although the injury incidences before and after halftime were similar, further analyses of player time and time of injury within each half are necessary.

https://openalex.org/W2961683579,Reconstruction of the Medial Ulnar Collateral Ligament of the Elbow: Biomechanical Comparison of a Novel Anatomic Technique to the Docking Technique,2019-07-01,2019,article,"In recent years, understanding of the anatomy of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) has evolved, demonstrating that the insertional footprint of the UCL on the ulna is more elongated and distally tapered than previously described. Current UCL reconstruction configurations do not typically re-create this native anatomy, which may represent a potential area for improvement.The purposes of this study were (1) to describe a novel anatomic UCL reconstruction technique designed to better replicate the native UCL anatomy and (2) to biomechanically compare this with the docking technique. The hypothesis was that the ultimate load to failure for the anatomic technique would not be inferior to the docking technique.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 16 fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities (8 matched pairs) were utilized. One elbow in each pair was randomized to receive UCL reconstruction via the docking technique or the novel anatomic UCL reconstruction technique with palmaris tendon autograft. Following reconstruction, biomechanical testing was performed by applying valgus rotational torque at a constant rate of 5 deg/s until ultimate mechanical failure of the construct occurred. Maximal torque (N·m), rotation stiffness (N·m/deg), and mode/location of failure were recorded for each specimen.The mean ultimate load to failure for elbows in the docking technique group was 23.8 ± 6.1 N·m, as compared with 31.9 ± 8.4 N·m in the anatomic technique group (P = .045). Mean rotational stiffness was 1.9 ± 0.7 versus 2.3 ± 0.9 N·m/deg for the docking and anatomic groups, respectively (P = .338). The most common mode of failure was suture pullout from the graft, which occurred in all 8 (100%) docking technique specimens and 7 of 8 (88%) specimens that underwent the anatomic UCL reconstruction technique.Ultimately, the anatomic UCL reconstruction technique demonstrated superior strength and resistance to valgus torque when compared with the docking technique, and this was comparable with that of the native UCL from prior studies. Increased initial strength may allow for earlier initiation of throwing postoperatively and potentially shorten return-to-play times.Current UCL reconstruction techniques do not accurately reproduce the UCL insertional anatomy on the ulna. The novel anatomic technique described may result in more natural joint kinematics. This study demonstrated load-to-failure rates that are significantly higher than with the docking technique and consistent with the native ligament, as reported from previous studies. These findings may serve as a foundation for future clinical study and optimization of this technique."

The biomechanical parameters differentiating these 2 distinct signs of injury are poorly described.To differentiate between cases of concussions with LOC and those with impact seizures by comparing the impact velocity, peak linear and peak rotational acceleration, as well as brain tissue deformation in the cerebral cortex, white matter, brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and corpus callosum.Descriptive laboratory study.Elite American football players who sustained an LOC (n = 20) or impact seizures (n = 21).Impact velocity, peak linear and peak rotational acceleration, maximum principal strain, cumulative strain damage measure at 10%, and strain rate (SR).The SR in the cerebral white matter was greater in the LOC group than in the impact-seizure group. Similar trends were observed for SRs in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and corpus callosum. No differences were present between groups for the other variables in this study.A lower SR in certain brain regions helps to explain why motor function is preserved and can be observed in patients with impact seizures versus LOC from concussive injuries."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate several methodological opportunities, to enhance the accuracy of this type of modelling. Specifically, we evaluated the potential benefits of 1) modelling match outcome using an increased number of seasons and PIs compared with previous reports, 2) how to identify eras where technical performance characteristics were stable and 3) the application of a novel feature selection method. Ninety-one PIs across sixteen Australian Football (AF) League seasons were analysed. Change-point and Segmented Regression analyses were used to identify eras and they produced similar but non-identical outcomes. A feature selection ensemble method identified the most valuable 45 PIs for modelling. The use of a larger number of seasons for model development lead to improvement in the classification accuracy of the models, compared with previous studies (88.8 vs 78.9%). This study demonstrates the potential benefits of large databases when creating models of match outcome and the pitfalls of determining whether there are eras in a longitudinal database."

This article compares distances and times for these disciplines systematically with each other and with running, walking, and swimming in the Summer Olympics. Regarding physiological implications, the absence of distances below 6 km in biathlon, 5 km in Nordic combined, 1.2-1.5 km in cross-country skiing, and 0.5 km in speed skating means recruiting fewer competitors with sprint characteristics (type IIx fast isoforms muscles, etc.). The absence of distances above 10 km in speed skating and Nordic combined, and 20 km in biathlon, means recruiting fewer or other kinds of competitors with long distance characteristics. For example, high anaerobic threshold is important at greater distances, and high VO2max is important above intermediate distances. A new recruitment criterion for Olympic events is proposed, argued to recruit athletes fairly and be fair to spectators. The new criterion supplements current criteria such as popularity, relevance, and cooperation. The article recommends assessing 26 new events for future Winter Olympics within the five disciplines, equivalently for men and women. Formats are specified for the new events. Regarding equal distances for men and women, women use 8.7-13.6% more time than men in most events, except when upper-body power is important (above 13.6%) and in ultraendurance events (below 5.3%)."

Recent evidence suggests that individuals may possess sensorimotor deficits beyond clinical recovery, predisposing them to further injury. This preliminary prospective case series aimed to determine if an inertial sensor instrumented Y balance test can capture changes in dynamic balance, regardless of apparent `clinical recovery', in six concussed elite rugby union players. The findings from this case series demonstrate that the inertial sensor-based measures can detect clinically meaningful changes in dynamic balance performance, not captured by the traditional clinical scoring methods, 48-hours post-injury and at the point of `clinical recovery' (return to play). Further research should investigate the role such instrumented dynamic balance assessments may play in the management of sports-related concussion."

https://openalex.org/W2965685462,Proximal Adductor Avulsion: A Biomechanical Comparison of Suture Anchor Repair Techniques,2019-07-01,2019,article,"Objectives: Acute avulsion of the proximal fibrocartilaginous origin of the adductor longus (AL) is an injury mostly occurring in individuals that perform cutting and rapid lateral movements such as in hockey, soccer, and rugby. Especially in competitive athletes, recent trends have advocated for surgical repair of these acute injuries. However, while multiple repair configurations have been proposed, the current literature lacks biomechanical data to guide surgical technique. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine load-to-failure values for two proximal adductor repair techniques and to compare their strength to that of a native, uninjured proximal adductor tendon. Methods: Seventeen cadaveric fresh frozen pelvic specimens were dissected to preserve the proximal adductor tendon and the fibrocartilage attachment to the pubis. The specimens were then divided into three groups: an intact AL tendon(baseline control), and ‘torn’ tendons repaired with either a 2-suture anchor or 4-suture anchor technique. Once repaired, specimens were cyclically loaded on a custom jig to simulate a maximal effort soccer-style kick. Testing endpoints included suture anchor pull-out, loss of clamp fixation, or catastrophic tendon failure. To control for individual differences, values were reported both in terms of gross force and as load-to-displacement ratios. Following collection, data from each of the three groups were recorded and analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and multiple comparison tests. Results: The mean load to failure for the 4-anchor group was 83.74±19.28 N, which was significantly greater than for either the intact (25.43±3.46 N, p &lt;0.05) or 2-anchor repair (20.58±1.33 N, p &lt;0.001) conditions. All intact and 4-anchor repair specimens failed via disruption distal to the adductor’s musculotendinous junction, with no failure at the bone-anchor interface noted in either of these groups. In contrast, 80% of 2-anchor repairs failed at the bone to anchor interface. In this group, following initial pullout, failure of a secondary anchor occurred with 41.4% less force than for the index failure (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study provides biomechanical data which identifies a 4-anchor repair as being much more resistant to surgical-site failure than a 2-anchor construct. Further, the 4-anchor group failed at the same anatomic location as the intact adductor group, suggesting that a 4-anchor construct results in a repair that acts similar to an uninjured control. Based on this finding, a 4-anchor repair construct should be preferentially used in proximal adductor repair whenever clinically feasible. [Figure: see text][Figure: see text]"

Aggerholm, K., O. Standal, D. M. Barker, and H. Larsson. 2018. ""On Practising in Physical Education: Outline for a Pedagogical Model."" Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy 23 (2): 197–208] recently made a case for the introduction of a new model. Based on the work of German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, the Movement-Oriented Practising Model (MPM) contains a philosophical rationale, a set of guiding principles, and an illustration of how lessons based on the model could look in the classroom. This paper reports empirical findings from an investigation in which the model was employed. The aim was to discern how students' movement dispositions develop when they take part in lessons guided by the MPM.Method: Empirical material was produced with one ninth-grade class that took part in ten lessons based on the MPM. Three types of empirical material were generated through observations, focus group interviews, and textual work produced by students. Analysis of the combined data was informed by Gilbert Ryle's [2009. The Concept of Mind. New York: Routledge] theory of knowing and dispositions.Findings: Four descriptive cases are presented. Each case focuses on a student's dispositional development over the course of the ten lessons. Dispositional development involved changes in: the ways students moved, the students' approaches to practicing and performing, and the ways the students described themselves and their learning.Discussion: The findings are discussed in relation to the philosophy and guiding principles of the MPM. Specifically, we consider: (1) how students developed in unique and personal ways during the module, (2) how dispositional development may not always be observable when students participate in lessons based on the MPM, and, (3) how time impacts upon learning when employing the MPM.Conclusion: Reflections on practical implications associated with the MPM are put forward and questions for further scholarly consideration are raised."

Early sport specialization may contribute to injury risk. The dynamic effects of maturation on reduced neuromuscular control may be amplified in young athletes who specialize in a single sport. The purpose of this study was to investigate if sport specialization is associated with increased proliferation of aberrant biomechanics during maturational development in adolescent female athletes. Seventy-nine sport-specialized female adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball athletes were identified and matched with seventy-nine multi-sport (soccer, basketball, and volleyball) female athletes from a database of 1116 female adolescent basketball, soccer, and volleyball athletes who were enrolled in one of two large prospective, longitudinal studies. The athletes were assessed over two visits in which they were classified as pre-maturational and post-maturational, respectively. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to compare sport-specialized and multi-sport groups and dominant/non-dominant limbs with respect to maturational changes in peak sagittal, frontal, and transverse plane joint angular measures and joint moments of force for the hip and knee joints over the two visits. Kinematic changes through maturation showed no significant interaction with the group × limb and the main effects of group or limb (all p > .05). Kinetic changes through maturation showed no significant interaction with the group × limb and the main effect of limb (both p > .05). The main effect of group was significant (F(6, 152) = 3.196, p = .005). The sport-specialized group sustained a smaller increase in peak knee extensor moment than the multi-sport group (F(1, 157) = 5.658, p = .018) and exhibited a larger increase in peak knee abduction moment (F(1, 157) = 5.790, p = .017) when compared to the multi-sport group. Sport-specialized female athletes exhibited altered biomechanics during landing while performing the DVJ task compared to multi-sport athletes through maturation, which may play a role in injury risk profiles of sport-specialized female athletes."

Headform accelerations were input into a finite-element model to approximate peak strain in the cerebrum.Stiffness was most influential on peak linear and angular acceleration, and strain was most influenced by velocity. Interaction effects demonstrated that the 9 kg mass had consistently higher peak linear and angular acceleration and strain than the 15 kg mass between 3.0 and 4.5 m/s.

Although the majority of pectoralis major ruptures are acute injuries, many chronic ruptures are unrecognized and it is imperative to understand the proper evaluation of these injuries, as well as the appropriate treatment for acute and chronic ruptures.Purpose: Pectoralis major ruptures can lead to deformity and physical disability if left untreated. This review paper discusses both acute and chronic ruptures as well as indications for nonoperative treatment and operative treatment to give the reader the best understanding of this diagnosis and proper management.Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using a search of electronic databases. Search terms such as pectoralis major rupture, pectoralis major repair, pectoralis major tendon transfer, and pectoralis major nonoperative treatment were used. Case reports, systematic reviews, prospective and retrospective studies were included to provide a comprehensive review. The only exclusion criteria consisted of studies not published in English. This review article includes the anatomy and biomechanics of the pectoralis major muscle, proper evaluation of the patient, operative and nonoperative treatment of acute and chronic pectoralis major ruptures, and outcomes of the recommended treatment.Conclusion: Nonoperative treatment is indicated for patients with medical comorbidities, older age, incomplete tears, or irreparable damage. Patients treated non-operatively have been shown to lose strength, but regain full range of motion. Patients with surgery before 6 weeks reported better outcomes than patients with surgery between 6 and 8 weeks. The chronicity of the rupture (>8 weeks) increases the likelihood of reconstruction, involving the use of autografts or allografts. Patients treated with delayed repair had significantly better strength, satisfaction, and outcomes than patients with nonoperative treatment. The pectoralis tendon can also be transferred in patients with rotators cuff tears, atrophy, or significant functional limitation. Tendon transfers have been shown to have unpredictable outcomes, but overall satisfactory results."

Pre-participation examinations, including musculoskeletal screening and functional performance testing, is an essential part of a multidisciplinary approach to prevent future injuries. Because the lower extremities are the most commonly-injured body area in basketball players. Assessing fundamental movement qualities is of utmost importance. The aim of our study was to determine if functional tests can predict sports injuries in elite female basketball players. A total of 351 records for professional female basketball players were screened during 2013–2016 season. We analysed functional characteristics before the season and used functional performance tests for injury risk assessment: the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), the lower quarter Y Balance test (YBT-LQ) and the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS). Data from 169 players’ records were analysed: 77 of them made it to the end of season without injury, making up the non-injured group, while 92 of them suffered lower limb sport injuries during the sport season (injury group). Student’s t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used to determine differences between groups. The most commonly encountered sports injuries in our population were those of knee 40.2% and ankle 38%. The injury group had a lower total FMS score ( p = 0.0001) and higher total LESS score ( p = 0.028) than non-injury group. The dynamic balance of lower limbs was similar in both groups. Imperfect functional movement patterns and poor jump-landing biomechanics during pre-season screening were associated with lower extremity injuries in elite female basketball players. Impairments of dynamic stability in the lower extremities were not associated with injury rates in our population. A combination of functional tests can be used for injury risk evaluation in female basketball players."
https://openalex.org/W2953562360,Regular physical activity modulates perceived visual speed when running in treadmill-mediated virtual environments,2019-06-26,2019,article,"In virtual reality, visual speed is usually underestimated relative to locomotor speed. Here we investigated how physical activity and fitness affect perceived visual speed when running in a treadmill-mediated virtual environment. Thirty healthy participants (ten sedentary individuals, ten team sport players and ten expert runners) ran on a treadmill at two different speeds (8, 12km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. Participants were asked to match the speed of the visual scene to their running speed (i.e. treadmill speed), indicating for each trial whether the scene was moving slower or faster than the treadmill. The speed of the visual scene was adjusted according to the participant’s response using a staircase until visual and running speeds were perceived as equivalent. More sedentary participants underestimated visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Specifically, visual speed had to exceed running speed to be perceived as equivalent. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and it was significantly larger for sedentary participants than for team sports players and expert runners. The volume of physical activity per week was found to be the best predictor of visual speed perception for both running speeds, while the perceived effort constituted a good predictor only at 8km/h. Physical fitness, on the other hand turned out to be a poor predictor of visual speed perception. Therefore, in order to enhance users’ engagement and their adherence to physical activity programs, the development of “personalized” treadmill-mediated virtual environments should take into account users’ personal characteristics to provide the most natural and engaging feedback possible."

The aim of this study was to determine whether the maximal knee angle and maximal angular velocity of the lead knee extension are associated with ball speed in elite drag-flick players. The kinematics of the drag flick was studied in 19 elite field-hockey players who performed 15 drag-flick shots each towards a target located 1.30 m high at optimal speed. A motion capture suit was used to capture full body drag-flick behaviour sampling at 240 Hz. Multiple regression analyses were used to study the association between both the maximal knee flexion angle and maximal angular velocity of the leading knee extension and ball speed. Significant positive associations were found between knee extension velocity and ball speed (R2 = .127, p < .001). A higher knee extension velocity resulted in higher ball speeds within the individual, without negatively affecting the accuracy. It is advised to train, within an elite drag-flick group, for higher knee extension speed to improve the drag-flick performance. Whether training to improve this parameter results in higher ball speeds should be subject of future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2955441104,Relationship Between Sport Expertise and Postural Skills,2019-06-25,2019,review,"The review addresses the relationship between sport expertise (i.e., sport competition level), postural performance (amount of motion of the center of mass/of pressure of foot or ability to preserve body balance), and postural strategy (geometric organization of different body segments as well as neurobiological involvement of organism). Since the conditions of postural evaluation are likely to influence results, the aim is to compare athletes at different competition levels in ecological postural conditions (specific postural conditions related to the sport practiced) and non-ecological postural conditions (decontextualized postural conditions in relation to the sport practiced). Evidence suggests that the most successful athletes in terms of sport competition level have the best postural performance both in ecological and non-ecological postural conditions. However, in non-ecological conditions, the postural tasks should be preferentially challenging or relatively close to the sport practice stance. Moreover, the most successful athletes also have more elaborate postural strategies compared with athletes at lower competition level. Mechanistic explanations as well as conceptual models are proposed to explain the role of different factors influencing the relationship between sport expertise and postural performance and strategy."

This is especially the case for rebounding-based protocols involving young athletes.To compare the frontal plane projection angles (FPPAs) during the drop vertical jump (DVJ) and tuck jump assessment (TJA) in a cohort of elite male youth soccer players of varying maturity status.A total of 57 male youth soccer players from an English championship soccer club participated in this study. Participants performed 3 trials of the DVJ and TJA, during which movement was recorded with 2-dimensional video cameras. FPPA for both right (FPPA-r) and left (FPPA-l) legs, with values <180° indicative of medial knee displacement.On a whole-group level, FPPA-r (172.7° [7.4°] vs 177.2° [11.7°]; P < .05; effect size [ES] = 0.46) and FPPA-l (173.4° [7.3°] vs 179.2° [11.0°]; P < .05; ES = 0.62) were significantly greater for both limbs in the TJA compared with the DVJ; however, these differences were less consistent when grouped by maturity status. FPPA-r during the TJA was significantly and moderately greater in the circa-peak height velocity (PHV) group compared with the post-PHV cohorts (169.4° [6.4°] vs 175.3° [7.8°]; P < .05; ES = 0.49). Whole-group data showed moderate relationships for FPPA-r and FPPA-l between the TJA and DVJ; however, stronger relationships were shown in circa- and post-PHV players compared with the pre-PHV cohort.Considering that the TJA exposed players to a larger FPPA and was sensitive to between-group differences in FPPA-r, the TJA could be viewed as a more suitable screen for identifying FPPA in young male soccer players."

Pretraining Landing Error Scoring System scores were used to determine risk groups.The FIFA 11+ group had greater improvement than the control group in terms of improving the landing pattern; there was a significant intergroup difference (F1,20 = 28.86, P < .001, ηp2=.591). Soccer players categorized as being at high risk displayed greater improvement from the FIFA 11+ program than those at low risk (P = .03). However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of risk category following the routine warm-up program (P = 1.000).The present study provides evidence of the usefulness of the FIFA 11+ program for reducing risk factors associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries. The authors' results also suggest that soccer players with the higher risk profile would benefit more than those with lower risk profiles and that targeting them may improve the efficacy of the FIFA 11+ program."

However, most of these studies measured the AT length between the calcaneus and medial head of the gastrocnemius and the reliability of such a measurement has not been satisfactorily presented. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the measurement of AT length within and between sessions. AT length was measured by using a combination of ultrasound imaging and optoelectronic stereophotogrammetry. Nineteen healthy athletes visited the lab on six different days where the AT length was measured on both lower extremities: 1) from the calcaneus to the mid-point of the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius; and 2) from the calcaneus to the soleus musculotendinous attachment. The reliability results indicated high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC > 0.8), a low typical error (< 0.6) and a standard error of measurement (SEM < 5.5 mm) for all measured AT lengths on within and between sessions. This non-invasive reliable measurement method may be recommended for sport science research purposes."

Based on the existing literature, there is a strong physiological rationale for the incorporation of eccentric training into a training program for an individual seeking to maximize muscle size, strength, and power. Specific adaptations may include an increase in muscle cross-sectional area, force output, and fiber shortening velocities, all of which have the potential to benefit power production characteristics. Tempo eccentric training, flywheel inertial training, accentuated eccentric loading, and plyometric training are commonly implemented in applied contexts. These methods tend to involve different force absorption characteristics and thus, overload the muscle or musculotendinous unit in different ways during lengthening actions. For this reason, they may produce different magnitudes of improvement in hypertrophy, strength, and power. The constraints to which they are implemented can have a marked effect on the characteristics of force absorption and therefore, could affect the nature of the adaptive response. However, the versatility of the constraints when prescribing these methods mean that they can be effectively implemented to induce these adaptations within a variety of populations."

Furthermore, reinjury to the ipsilateral or contralateral knee can occur in &gt;20% of athletes. Female sex and younger age are known risk factors for graft failure. The optimal graft choice for young females remains unknown and poorly studied. Purpose/Hypothesis: The authors aimed to compare clinical outcomes in young females who underwent ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB) and quadrupled hamstring (HS) autografts. It was hypothesized that no significant differences in outcomes exist between graft choices. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Female patients aged 15 to 25 years who underwent primary ACLR with BTB or HS autograft were included for review. Patients were subdivided into 2 age groups: 15 to 20 years and 21 to 25 years. The occurrence of chondral, meniscal, or ligamentous injury to either knee was recorded for comparison. Results: A total of 256 females were included (BTB, n = 175; HS, n = 81). The majority of patients were between the ages of 15 and 20 years (BTB, 80%; HS, 77.8%). Overall, graft rupture occurred in 23 patients (9%) and contralateral ACL tear occurred in 18 (7%). Subgroup analysis showed that 75% of BTB and 100% of HS graft retears occurred in females aged 15 to 20 years. Within this age group, there was a significantly lower rate of graft ruptures in the BTB group (6.4%) as compared with the HS group (17.5%, P = .02). Allograft augmentation was used in 4 of the 11 HS grafts that retore. When allograft-augmented grafts were excluded, there was no significant difference in graft failure rate between graft choices. Fifteen patients in the BTB group (12%) as opposed to 1 in the HS group (2%) reported extreme difficulty or the inability to kneel on the front of the knee ( P = .04). Conclusion: In females aged 15 to 20 years undergoing ACLR, BTB autograft may lead to fewer graft ruptures than HS autograft. While this difference was not observed in females aged 21 to 25 years, a larger sample may be required to accept the null hypothesis in this age group. BTB autograft significantly increased the risk of kneeling pain as compared with HS regardless of age."

A Footwork® Pro pressure platform was used to study plantar pressures and an Achilles® bone scanner was used to record the bone stiffness of the calcaneus. The variables analyzed were plantar surface, percentage of force per area (forefoot and hindfoot), distance between the center of pressure and the projection of the center of mass in standing, and calcaneal bone stiffness.Results: The values of bone stiffness of the calcaneus were higher in badminton players than control group in the dominant lower limb (Badminton = 114.32 ± 18.97 U.A. vs. Control = 102.07 ± 16.36 U.A.; p = 0.019) and non-dominant lower limb (Badminton = 115.12 ± 21.95 U.A. vs Control = 101.37 ± 15.72 U.A.; p = 0.014). Badminton players showed asymmetric values in mean pressure (dominant = 35.41 ± 6.05 Kpa vs. non-dominant = 39.21 ± 6.54 Kpa; p = 0.011) and distance among center of pressure of each foot and center of mass (dominant = 11.28 ± 1.65 cm vs. non-dominant = 10.48 ± 1.63 cm; p = 0.025).Conclusions: The calcaneal stiffness of the badminton players was higher than control group, which places badminton in the category of osteogenic sports. The badminton players showed an asymmetric pattern during the static balance, which may be an indicative of asymmetries derived from the continued practice of badminton."

Injury to articular cartilage is a significant cause of pain and dysfunction that may eventually lead to osteoarthritis or degenerative arthrosis. Management of these injuries is complicated by the complex architecture and poor vascularity of this tissue. The field of articular cartilage restoration has evolved rapidly over the past several decades and current techniques offer promising results. However, despite the fast pace of progress in the treatment and repair of articular cartilage injury, a clear gold standard in management has yet to emerge. Current techniques for managing cartilage injuries discussed in this review include bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral transplantation, chondrocyte implantation, cell-based transplantation, biological augmentation and scaffold-based therapies. Heterogeneity in study design, including surgical procedures, lesion and patient characteristics, cell collection, biologics preparation protocols and outcome measures limits interpretation of results presented in the literature. Therefore, standardisation across research protocols and collaboration among centres will be necessary. This 'state-of-the-art review' presents the indications and techniques for managing ankle articular cartilage lesions, as well as future directions and geographical differences in management."

This study aims to compare the head kinematics and brain strain response between two oblique test protocols for simulating fall impact events in cycling. (1) The Angular Launched Impact (ALI) protocol simulates a head impact for realistic and typical falling events in cycling such as falling over the bicycle handle bars or laterally falling, and (2) EN13087-11 is a currently proposed standard test that simulates a head impact from a vertical fall onto an angled surface. EN13087-11 reported greater rotational head kinematics and brain tissue strain than occurs in the more frequent and realistic falling events simulated by the ALI. Differences in response are attributed to the different vector of impact forces associated with the ALI and EN13087-11. When considering how best to test a helmet under oblique impact conditions, it is recommended that a certification test should closely mimic real-world kinematics of cycling accidents."

Peak and sum PlayerLoad were not different comparing fastball to curveball (N = 12; ESIpeak = 0.24, p = 0.050 and ESISum<0.01, p = 0.106) and fastball to slider (N = 12; ESIpeak = 0.32, p = 0.088 and ESISum = 0.02, p = 0.221). Fastball velocity (37.1 ± 2.1 m/s) differed from the changeup (33.8 ± 1.9 m/s; p < 0.001), curveball (32.2 ± 1.2; p < 0.001), and slider (33.8 ± 1.3 m/s; p < 0.001). Pitching workload may differ based on pitch type. Pitch counts may not capture true player fatigue due to variability in stresses resulting from different pitch types."

https://openalex.org/W2951030871,Part I: epidemiology and risk factors for stress fractures in female athletes,2019-06-19,2019,review,"Objectives: Stress fractures (SFx) are a common athletic injury, occurring in up to 40% of athletes at some point in their career. These injuries can cause pain, permanent disability, financial burden, and loss of playing time. This review presents updated epidemiology and comprehensive analysis of risk factors for stress fractures, especially as it pertains to female athletes.Results: Stress fractures (SFx) account for up to 10% of all orthopedic injuries and up to 20% of injuries seen in sports medicine clinics, with an incidence among female athletes as high as 13%. Lower extremity SFx represent 80-95% of SFx, and the increased popularity of endurance running has contributed to the tibia (49% prevalence) replacing the metatarsals (9%) as the most common location for lower extremity SFx. Studies have demonstrated that 50% of peak bone mass is acquired during adolescence, a 'peak time' for eating disorder and female athlete triad development; furthermore, catch-up growth cannot be expected in athletes with diminished bone growth in this critical period. The female athlete triad (low energy availability with or without disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density) are well-known risk factors for SFx; the risk of SFx for female athletes presenting with a single aspect of the triad is 15-20%, and this risk increases to 30-50% for female athletes presenting with multiple aspects of the triad.Conclusion: This review provides a basis for how to identify populations at greatest risk for SFx. Prompt recognition of the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for SFx in female athletes is imperative to early diagnosis and to develop targeted strategies to prevent SFx occurrence or recurrence."

https://openalex.org/W2950665421,Concussion in Sports,2019-06-19,2019,review,"Concussion, a peculiar type of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is an injury frequently encountered in various contact and noncontact sports, such as boxing, martial arts, American football, rugby, soccer, ice hockey, horse riding, and alpine skiing. Concussion occurs anytime external forces of specific intensities provoke acceleration–deceleration of the brain, and it is characterized by the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurologic functions, spontaneously resolving within weeks, persisting for longer times only in a small percentage of cases. A wide range of molecular alterations, including mitochondrial dysfunction, energy deficit, and gene and protein expression changes, is triggered by concussion and lasts longer than clinical symptoms. In recent years, concussion has become a primary issue of discussion among sports medicine professionals, athletes, media, and sports sponsors in relation to athletes’ return to play, after a concussion. Continued improvement in prevention and management of concussed athletes requires extensive research from different disciplines. Research work needs to focus on both prevention and management. Researchers and clinicians’ efforts should be dedicated to a better understanding of the molecular changes occurring in the post-concussed brain and to clearly define healing after concussion for a safe return of athletes to play. It is essential for sports medicine professionals to stay informed about the advances in understanding concussions and how to rehabilitate each single player who sustained a concussion."

In response to these identified differences, several institutions have established Women's Sports Medicine Programs (WSMPs). The purpose of this study was to determine the number of WSMPs and explore program characteristics such as geographic location, specialties represented, common conditions treated, program history, and patient population.Methods: An extensive internet search was conducted to identify WSMPs in the United States. The second part of this study involved a 13-question, anonymous, electronic survey that was distributed to the directors of identified WSMPs to gather further data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.Results: Nineteen WSMPs were identified and the majority have been in existence for 6 to 10 years (44.4%). The survey was delivered to 18 programs and 9 WSMP directors responded (50% response rate). The most commonly reported number of physicians, across all specialties, comprising the core network was two physicians (4 programs, 44.4%). Health care providers with fourteen different areas of specialization were identified across all programs. The most common conditions treated were patellofemoral pain syndrome (33.3%), stress fracture (33.3%), and ACL tear (22.2%). In 5 programs (55.5%), patients < 18 years of age accounted for less than 25% of total patients. Only 2 programs (22.2%) reported that >51% of patients were actively participating in sports.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that nineteen Women's Sports Medicine Programs have been established in the United States. These programs address conditions known to have a higher incidence in the active female population, however the WSMPs are not solely geared towards the treatment of active female athletes. The information provided in this study can serve as a guide for the development of future WSMPs, as well as, future research studies regarding WSMPs."

The whole player focused FPHS is designed to deepen understanding of the benefits and risks of participation in ASF, identify risks that are potentially reversible or preventable, and develop interventions or approaches to improve the health and wellbeing of former players. We are recruiting and following a cohort of former professional ASF players who played since 1960 (current n = 3785). At baseline, participants complete a self‐administered standardized questionnaire, including initial reporting of exposure history and physician‐diagnosed health conditions. Additional arms of the initiative are addressing targeted studies, including promising primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions; extensive in‐person clinical phenotyping, and legal and ethical concerns of the play. This paper describes the components of the FPHS studies undertaken and completed thus far, as well as those studies currently underway or planned for the near future. We present our initiatives herein as a potential paradigm of one way to proceed (acknowledging that it is not the only way). We share what we have learned so that it may be useful to others, particularly in regard to trying to make professional sports meet the needs of multiple stakeholders ranging from players to owners, to fans, and possibly even to parents making decisions for their children."

However, the continued high incidence of concussion in American football, has led researchers to investigate novel helmet liner strategies. These strategies typically supplement existing technologies by adding or integrating head-helmet decoupling mechanisms. Decoupling strategies aim to redirect or redistribute impact force around the head, reducing impact energy transferred to the brain. This results in decreased brain tissue strain, which is beneficial in injury risk reduction due to the link between tissue strain and concussive injury.The purpose of this study was to mathematically demonstrate the effect of ten cases, representing theoretical redirection and redistribution helmet liner strategies, on brain tissue strain resulting from impacts to the head. The kinematic response data from twenty head impacts collected in the laboratory was mathematically modified to represent the altered response of the ten different cases and used as input parameters to determine the effect on maximum principal strain (MPS) values, calculated using finite element modeling. The results showed that a reduced dominant coordinate component (contributes the greatest to resultant) of rotational acceleration decreased maximum principal strain in American football helmets. The study theoretically demonstrates that liner strategies, if applied correctly, can influence brain motion, reduce brain tissue strain, and could decrease injury risk in an American football helmet."

THE CASE OF LIU JINGMIN’S EARLY EXPERIMENTS. “PORÓWNANIA” 1 (24), 2019. Vol. XXIV, P. 175-194. ISSN 1733-165X. The paper is a result of several years’ research conducted in Taiwan. It presents the early years of one of the most interesting theatre groups from Taipei, You Juchang/U-Theatre/Youren Shengu, which was established in 1988 by Liu Jingmin (Liu Ruoyu). Liu Jingmin was much inspired by Jerzy Grotowski’s idea of actor’s training presented by him in Irvine (California) in the mid-eighties. The article shows how Liu Jingmin started from imitating Grotowski’s physical exercises and later she focused on understanding her native culture. She rethought many Chinese and Taiwanese forms of theatre, meditation and breathing techniques, music and dance traditions, culture of masks andreligious rituals. The aim of this paper is to describe how Liu Jingmin for more than three decades had been working on a comprehensive development of the actor through perfecting his technical skills along with their spirit. Her goal was the internal/spiritual and external/physical transformation of a performer and finally creating a beautiful person."

At the time he became World Champion he also achieved among the highest reported maximal oxygen uptake (V̇o2max) value, 96.7 ml·min-1·kg-1, or 7,397 ml/min in absolute terms at 76.5 kg, which had increased by 29.6% from 74.6 ml·min-1·kg-1 pre-bike-specific training. After 15 mo with almost no structured exercise training, V̇o2max returned to 77.0 mL·min-1·kg-1 and was similar to the value reported before specific bike training, albeit with absolute term (6,205 ml/min) still being 11.3% higher. Part of the explanation for his athletic achievements is likely also related to the up to 20.9% improvement in Power@4 mmol/l (W). Although genetic profiles of endurance athletes have not generated data suggesting a shared genetic signature associated with elite endurance performance, this case study highlights the importance of intrinsic biological factors in elite endurance performance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows that very high V̇o2max values (>70 ml·min-1·kg-1) can be found in individuals not previously specializing in aerobic training and that values of >90 ml·min-1·kg-1, as well as a cycling world junior champion title, can be achieved in such individuals with just 3 yr of dedicated exercise training."

The ergonomics focus regarding job design is to address the issue of fitting the job to the worker. This means that other things such as space, matter, pedagogical parameters and the organizational environment need to be adjusted to the worker, to obtain optimal performance. Hence, it is important that jobs are designed in such a way that the environment of the worker becomes ergonomically better. Methods. Seventeen interviews were undertaken with employees from call centres of three major telecom companies in Islamabad. The interviews were semi-structured and NVivo version 10 was used for analysis. Results. The results indicated an influence of the following ergonomic factors on job design: (a) force, mental well-being and supervisor and peer support acted more on the complexity of the task; (b) inappropriate postures, mental well-being, characteristics of work, supervisor and peer support and the work environment acted on the skill and efforts required; (c) repetitiveness, workstation design, mental well-being, supervisor and peer support, work environment and characteristics of work acted more on the degree of worker's control. Conclusion. The issues related to these factors should be addressed to improve job design in the workplace."

https://openalex.org/W2949885369,A low-cost test rig for impact experiments on a dummy head,2019-06-12,2019,article,"Anthropomorphic test dummies are commonly used to evaluate the potential harm to humans due to dangerous scenarios, such as that due to car accidents. Furthermore, they have been used in sports to evaluate the efficacy of protective gears in mitigating harm due to impacts. Recently, they have been considered in industrial and collaborative robotics to assess risks due interactions between a human and a robot. In this article, we describe the development of a low-cost dummy head impact rig. The motivation behind this project is to quantify the potential harm to a child's head due to impacts with a small robotic toy. Three severity indices can be estimated, namely, Head Acceleration Criterion (HIC), 3 ms criterion, and peak head acceleration. Furthermore, the artificial skin of the dummy head can be used to assess the potential for tissue injuries. 3D-printed parts were used to develop the head. A tri-axial accelerometer embedded inside the head was used to measure the changes in accelerations. The developed head was placed inside a dedicated experimental bench. A data acquisition card that is connected to a computer system was used to acquire the raw data and then store it. A script was used to postprocess the stored data for the three severity indices. A video camera recording in slow-motion was used to record the impacts. The calculation of the impact velocities was based on the analysis of the video recordings using an open-source software. The developed experimental setup was validated by producing comparable results to that of relevant previous studies."

For irreparable tears of the tendon, a salvage procedure is indicated with segmental resection followed by reconstruction with tenodesis, tendon transfer, or bridging the defect using allograft or autograft. Although there is insufficient evidence to guide which of these treatment options provides the best outcomes, reconstruction with tendon allograft has provided satisfactory clinical results and is effective for pain relief and restoration of tendon function. However, there are concerns about the use of tendon allografts which include its cost and availability, disease transmission, delayed incorporation, and stretching of the graft. The aim of this study is to present the surgical technique for the reconstruction of the peroneus brevis tendon tears using semitendinosus tendon autograft as an alternative to the allograft and report the short-term results of three cases."

Due to the lack of human test data, real-world accident data is useful for the research on the mechanism and tolerance of head injuries. The objective of the present work is to investigate pedestrian head-brain injuries through real car-pedestrian accidents and evaluate the existed injury criteria. Seven car-to-pedestrian accidents in China were selected from the IVAC (Investigation of Vehicle Accident in Changsha) database. Accident reconstructions using multi-body models were conducted to determine the kinematic parameters associated with the injury and were used to measure head injury criteria. Kinematic parameters were input into a finite element model to run simulations on the head-brain and car interface to determine levels of brain tissue stress, strain, and brain tissue injury criteria. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine the probability of head injury risk associated with AIS3+ injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale). The results showed that head injury criteria using kinematic parameters can effectively predict injury risk of a pedestrians’ head skull. Regarding brain injuries, physical parameters like coup/countercoup pressure are more effective predictors. The results of this study can be used as the background knowledge for pedestrian friendly car design."

A systematic search was completed to identify acute and longitudinal studies assessing the effects of lower limb WR on sprint running performance from international peer-reviewed journals. The Boolean phrases (limb OR leg OR lower extremity) AND (sprint*) AND (resist* OR weight OR load*) were used to search PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis that reported the acute kinematic and kinetic effects (n = 8), acute performance effects (n = 3), and longitudinal effects (n = 1). Results showed that the WR micro-loading (0.6-5% body mass) significantly increased contact time (2.9-8.9%), decreased step frequency (-1.4 to -3.7%), and slowed total sprint times (0.6-7.4%). Unloaded sprinting immediately following sprints with lower limb WR resulted in no significant change to total sprinting times. One longitudinal training study did not find a significant effect on maximal sprinting speed for non-trained participants. It can be concluded that not all step kinematic variables are affected during sprinting with an added load up to 5% body mass. Therefore, coaches can use lower limb WR to selectively overload certain aspects of sprint running, in particular stride frequency. It also appears that lower limb WR overloads sprint movement velocity and may provide a stimulus to increase horizontal force output, therefore, it may be inferred that lower limb WR has the potential to elicit improved sprinting performance."

Seventeen female and 17 male collegiate team sport athletes completed seven anticipated and seven unanticipated sidestep trials during which three-dimensional CoM data were recorded. Female athletes had a reduced ability to reorient their CoM towards the desired direction of travel (lower medio-lateral and anterior-posterior CoM velocity) than their male counterparts, with reduced medial (closer to stance foot) and increased posterior positioning of CoM relative to the stance foot (p < 0.05). When planning time was limited, female and male athletes performed sidestepping with CoM further from the stance foot (more medial) and more anterior than in the anticipated condition (p < 0.05) at reduced medio-lateral velocities. Sex and condition control strategy differences were evident both in the preparatory phase and the stance phase. The current research draws attention to the foreseen benefits of training athletes, with particular emphasis on females, to direct CoM towards the desired direction of travel in the preparatory and stance phases within temporally constrained situations for improved performance."

Only players that were placed on the 'Disabled List' were included in the study. Our database included the player's position, injury location, injury cause, and time spent on the Disabled List.Results: A total of 3090 injuries were recorded; 511 (17%) were shoulder injuries, making it the most vulnerable anatomic location in baseball (N = 511). Of the 511 shoulder injuries, 132 (25.8%) were due to inflammation, making it the most common cited cause of shoulder injury. Most shoulder injuries occurred in April with 125 (24%) injuries, while June and May came in second and third with 89 (17%) and 81 (16%) injuries, respectively. The pitcher was the player most prone to injury, as it constituted 78% of the injuries. The average time spent off by a shoulder injury was 69 days, which implicated substantial economic losses for the injured athlete's club.Conclusion: Shoulder injuries are prevalent in professional baseball. The overhead pitching motion puts the shoulder at risk and accounts for the high incidence of its injuries."

Pathophysiologic models suggest that traumatic biomechanical forces caused by rotational deceleration lead to shear stress, which triggers a neurometabolic cascade beginning with excitotoxicity and leading to significant energy demands and a period of metabolic crisis for the injured brain. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) offers a means for non-invasive measurement of neurometabolic changes after concussion. Objective: Describe longitudinal changes in metabolites measured in vivo in the brains of adolescent patients with concussion. Methods: We prospectively recruited nine patients ages 11 to 20 who presented to a pediatric Emergency Department within 24 hours of concussion. Patients underwent MRI scanning within 72 hours (acute, n = 8), two weeks (subacute, n = 7), and at approximately one year (chronic, n = 7). Healthy, age and sex-matched controls were recruited and scanned once (n = 9). 1H MRS was used to measure N-acetyl-aspartate, choline, creatine, glutamate+glutamine, and myo-inositol concentrations in six regions of interest: left and right frontal white matter, posterior white matter and thalamus. Results: There was a significant increase in total thalamus glutamate+glutamine/choline at the subacute (p = .010) and chronic (p = .010) time points, and a significant decrease in total white matter myo-inositol/choline (p = .030) at the chronic time point as compared to controls. Conclusion: There are no differences in 1H MRS measurements in the acute concussive period; however, changes in glutamate+glutamine and myo-inositol concentrations detectable by 1H-MRS may develop beyond the acute period."

Peak torque, total work, mean power, angle of peak torque, hamstring-quadriceps torque ratio (H-Q ratio) and torque-angle-velocity surface maps were analysed from knee extension-flexion at 60, 120 and 300 degrees per second (°/s).Significant differences were identified for extensor peak torque between PRO x = 202.3 Newton metre (N·m) (standard deviation [SD] = 24.4) and U17 x = 141.6 N·m (30.1) at 60 °/s (p < 0.001; d = 2.21) as well as flexor peak torque (PRO x = 75.7 N·m [10.3] and U17 x = 57.7 N·m [11.4]) at 120 °/s (p < 0.001; d = 1.65) for the dominant limb. There were also significant group differences for total work and mean power at all velocities for extension and flexion. Surface maps demonstrated higher torque at lower speeds for both groups with smaller torque changes across velocities for flexion.Different groups of female volleyball players showed contrasting concentric knee muscle strength across isokinetic velocities.These results demonstrate the importance of specific strength training for different age groups, even within the same sport, and provide insight into muscle strength."

Such research recognizes learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders (LD/ADHD) as co-morbidities that should be addressed in concussion research and management. This forensic study has three objectives: 1) to investigate the prevalence of such diagnoses and examine neuropsychological test results among incoming college football players at a major US university 2) to examine how LD/ADHD diagnoses were addressed in concussion research that included such athletes, and 3) to address the implication of these results for ongoing concussion litigation. This study observed LD/ADHD rates among football athletes exceeding 50% in multiple cohort-years, a degree of magnitude greater than the rate among general college student populations. Neuropsychological testing revealed scores among some incoming freshman college football players consistent with those of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Evidence of cognitive impairment among incoming college football players raises concern over the potential effects of cumulative exposure to head trauma and the increased risk associated with continued participation in collision sports. We discuss the implications of our findings for concussion litigation and research ethics."
https://openalex.org/W2948236295,Changes in Cross-sectional Area and Signal Intensity of Healing Anterior Cruciate Ligaments and Grafts in the First 2 Years After Surgery,2019-06-05,2019,article,"Background: The quality of a repaired anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or reconstructed graft is typically quantified in clinical studies by evaluating knee, lower extremity, or patient performance. However, magnetic resonance imaging of the healing ACL or graft may provide a more direct measure of tissue quality (ie, signal intensity) and quantity (ie, cross-sectional area). Hypotheses: (1) Average cross-sectional area or signal intensity of a healing ACL after bridge-enhanced ACL repair (BEAR) or a hamstring autograft (ACL reconstruction) will change postoperatively from 3 to 24 months. (2) The average cross-sectional area and signal intensity of the healing ligament or graft will correlate with anatomic features of the knee associated with ACL injury. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients with a complete midsubstance ACL tear who were treated with either BEAR (n = 10) or ACL reconstruction (n = 10) underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Images were analyzed to determine the average cross-sectional area and signal intensity of the ACL or graft at each time point. ACL orientation, stump length, and bony anatomy were also assessed. Results: Mean cross-sectional area of the grafts was 48% to 98% larger than the contralateral intact ACLs at all time points ( P &lt; .01). The BEAR ACLs were 23% to 28% greater in cross-sectional area than the contralateral intact ACLs at 3 and 6 months ( P &lt; .02) but similar at 12 and 24 months. The BEAR ACLs were similar in sagittal orientation to the contralateral ACLs, while the grafts were 6.5° more vertical ( P = .005). For the BEAR ACLs, a bigger notch correlated with a bigger cross-sectional area, while a shorter ACL femoral stump, steeper lateral tibial slope, and shallower medial tibial depth were associated with higher signal intensity ( R 2 &gt; .40, P &lt; .05). Performance of notchplasty resulted in an increased ACL cross-sectional area after the BEAR procedure ( P = .007). No anatomic features were correlated with ACL graft size or signal intensity. Conclusion: Hamstring autografts were larger in cross-sectional area and more vertically oriented than the native ACLs at 24 months after surgery. BEAR ACLs had a cross-sectional area, signal intensity, and sagittal orientation similar to the contralateral ACLs at 24 months. The early signal intensity and cross-sectional area of the repaired ACL may be affected by specific anatomic features, including lateral tibial slope and notch width—observations that deserve further study in a larger cohort of patients.

Subjects were identified in a nationwide registry and invited to answer a return to sport and performance questionnaire, and the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score Sport subscale investigating difficulties in eight specific sports activities (HAGOS sport items) as; none, mild, moderate, severe or extreme. Subjects were divided into two groups based on sport performance (optimal or impaired). The proportion of athletes with none-to-mild versus moderate-to-extreme difficulties in the eight specific sport activities was compared between groups. The association between difficulties in sport activities and sport performance were investigated using logistic regression analysis. One hundred and eighty-four athletes (31 athletes with optimal and 153 athletes with impaired sport performance) were included at a mean follow-up of 33.1 ± 16.3 months. Up to six athletes (<20%) with optimal sport performance had moderate-to-extreme difficulties in sport activities. Contrary, 43-108 athletes (28.1-70.6%) with impaired performance had moderate-to-extreme difficulties in sport activities. Furthermore, moderate-to-extreme difficulties in HAGOS sport items: 'running as fast as you can' and 'kicking, skating etc.' increased the odds (14.7 and 6.1 times, respectively) of having impaired sport performance. Many athletes with impaired sport performance reported moderate-to-extreme difficulties in sport activities, specifically moderate-to-extreme difficulties in 'running as fast as you can' and 'kicking, skating etc.' were associated with patients having impaired sport performance."

Furthermore, it discusses the biological makeup of tendons and ligaments and how genetic variation may influence this and predisposition to injury. Elite rugby has one of the highest reported injury incidences of any professional sport. This is likely due to a combination of well-established injury surveillance systems and the characteristics of the game, whereby high-impact body contact frequently occurs, in addition to the high intensity, multispeed and multidirectional nature of play. Some of the most severe of all these injuries are tendon and ligament/joint (non-bone), and therefore, potentially the most debilitating to a player and playing squad across a season or World Cup competition. The aetiology of these injuries is highly multi-factorial, with a growing body of evidence suggesting that some of the inter-individual variability in injury susceptibility may be due to genetic variation. However, little effort has been devoted to the study of genetic injury traits within rugby athletes. Due to a growing understanding of the molecular characteristics underpinning the aetiology of injury, investigating genetic variation within elite rugby is a viable and worthy proposition. Therefore, we propose several single nucleotide polymorphisms within candidate genes of interest; COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, MIR608, MMP3, TIMP2, VEGFA, NID1 and COLGALT1 warrant further study within elite rugby and other invasion sports."

Research, however, has shown a lack of reliability or sensitivity of available methodologies. This study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability and sensitivity of a novel lateral stability protocol, the Submaximal Lateral Shuffle Test (SLST). We recruited 11 and 40 participants to assess reliability and sensitivity of the SLST, respectively. Participants performed the SLST in footwear that differed in collar height and upper stiffness. ICC values showed good to excellent reliability in peak ankle angles and moments, ground reaction forces, impulses, stance time, and performance time. Significantly lower peak inversion and adduction angles and lower medio-lateral push off peak forces were found in the high cut shoes compared to the low cut shoes. The medio-lateral landing peak force showed lower forces in the high cut shoes. The smallest worthwhile change indicated meaningful differences in 70.0-82.5% of participants for inversion, adduction, medio-lateral landing peak, and push off peak forces. These results, however, were not systematic such that there was not a consistent direction of the difference for all participants. In conclusion, the SLST is a promising protocol to further investigate lateral stability in footwear."

The growing number of concussion assessments increases the difficulty for researchers and clinicians to determine the best method of concussion diagnosis.Purpose: To systematically review the current assessments selected for acute sports-related concussion.Methods: Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus were searched. English-language, peer-review published studies of acute (<72 h) concussion assessments were included.Results: A total of 31 studies met inclusion criteria (of 291 evaluated); 27 studies provided sufficient information to be included in the descriptive statistics of the assessments. Six of these assessments were used in at least three studies. Only 12 percent of the population studied was female. The age range for these assessments was 9–67 years, although most participants ranged in age between 18 and 35 years.Conclusion: There is a need for a 'gold' standard concussion assessment to enable consistency across research and clinical outcomes. We found a large discrepancy between the number of males and females assessed, suggesting that future studies are needed to determine if these current assessments identify concussion signs and symptoms unique to females. Further studies are needed to determine which assessments are appropriate and valid for youth athletes."

However, it seems that in movements involving eccentric-concentric muscular contractions, a higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio should have a positive impact on human movement performance. The present study is aimed at identifying relationships between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables describing countermovement and drop jumps. The study was carried out in a group of 14 female soccer players. The tests were conducted using a Kistler force plate, an SG electrogoniometer, and the Biodex System 4 Pro dynamometer. Each player performed three countermovement jumps (CMJ) and three drop jumps (DJ) from heights of 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm. The peak torques of knee extensors and flexors were measured in isometric conditions and in isokinetic conditions at angular velocities of 30o/s, 60o/s, 90o/s, and 120o/s. Statistically significant relationships were found between the variables that describe CMJ, DJ 15, DJ 30, and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio at some, though not all, of the angular velocities measured. No significant relationships were found between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables that describe DJ 45 and DJ 60. The heights of CMJ, DJ 15, and DJ 30 were increased with higher hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratios. Analogous relationships were found between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and relative mechanical power during the take-off phase of the CMJ. Significant relationships between the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and variables that describe vertical jump are likely to be observed if adequate angular velocity is used in the measurement of muscle torque."

After an LAS, a large proportion of individuals develop long-term symptoms, which contribute to the development of chronic ankle instability (CAI). Due to the prevalence of LASs and the propensity to develop CAI, collective efforts toward reducing the risk of sustaining these injuries should be a priority of the sports medicine and sports physiotherapy communities. The comprehensive injury-causation model was developed to illustrate the interaction of internal and external risk factors in the occurrence of the inciting injury. The ability to mitigate injury risk is contingent on a comprehensive understanding of risk factors for injury. The objective of this current concepts review is to use the comprehensive injury-causation model as a framework to illustrate the risk factors for LAS and CAI based on the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2948893994,Meniscal allograft transplants and new scaffolding techniques,2019-06-01,2019,review,"Clinical management of meniscal injuries has changed radically in recent years. We have moved from the model of systematic tissue removal (meniscectomy) to understanding the need to preserve the tissue.Based on the increased knowledge of the basic science of meniscal functions and their role in joint homeostasis, meniscus preservation and/or repair, whenever indicated and possible, are currently the guidelines for management.However, when repair is no longer possible or when facing the fact of the previous partial, subtotal or total loss of the meniscus, meniscus replacement has proved its clinical value. Nevertheless, meniscectomy remains amongst the most frequent orthopaedic procedures.Meniscus replacement is currently possible by means of meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) which provides replacement of the whole meniscus with or without bone plugs/slots. Partial replacement has been achieved by means of meniscal scaffolds (mainly collagen or polyurethane-based). Despite the favourable clinical outcomes, it is still debatable whether MAT is capable of preventing progression to osteoarthritis. Moreover, current scaffolds have shown some fundamental limitations, such as the fact that the newly formed tissue may be different from the native fibrocartilage of the meniscus.Regenerative tissue engineering strategies have been used in an attempt to provide a new generation of meniscal implants, either for partial or total replacement. The goal is to provide biomaterials (acellular or cell-seeded constructs) which provide the biomechanical properties but also the biological features to replace the loss of native tissue. Moreover, these approaches include possibilities for patient-specific implants of correct size and shape, as well as advanced strategies combining cells, bioactive agents, hydrogels or gene therapy.Herein, the clinical evidence and tips concerning MAT, currently available meniscus scaffolds and future perspectives are discussed.

Most patients heal uneventfully, but those with symptoms persisting past 3 months should be evaluated for chronic ankle instability and its associated conditions as well as for the presence of varus malalignment. Chronic ankle instability is initially treated nonoperatively, with surgical management reserved for those who have failed to improve after 3 to 6 months of bracing and functional rehabilitation. Anatomic repair using a modification of the Broström procedure is the preferred technique for initial surgery. Anatomic reconstruction with tendon graft should be considered when repair is not possible, as it maintains physiological joint kinematics. Nonanatomic reconstructions are seldom indicated. Arthroscopic repair or reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments is a promising new technique with results similar to those of open surgery."

Whereas the underlying cause of CAI is disputed, alterations in cortical motor functioning may contribute to the perceived dysfunction.To assess differences in cortical activity during single-limb stance among control, coper, and CAI groups.Cross-sectional study.Biomechanics laboratory.A total of 31 individuals (10 men, 21 women; age = 22.3 ± 2.4 years, height = 169.6 ± 9.7 cm, mass = 70.6 ± 11.6 kg), who were classified into control (n = 13), coper (n = 7), and CAI (n = 11) groups participated in this study.Participants performed single-limb stance on a force platform for 60 seconds while wearing a 24-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) changes in the supplementary motor area (SMA), precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobe were measured.Differences in averages and standard deviations of HbO2 were assessed across groups. In the CAI group, correlations were analyzed between measures of cortical activation and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) scores.No differences in average HbO2 were present for any cortical areas. We observed differences in the standard deviation for the SMA across groups; specifically, the CAI group demonstrated greater variability than the control (r = 0.395, P = .02; 95% confidence interval = 0.34, 0.67) and coper (r = 0.38, P = .04; 95% confidence interval = -0.05, 0.69) groups. We demonstrated a strong correlation that was significant in the CAI group between the CAIT score and the average HbO2 of the precentral gyrus (ρ = 0.64, P = .02) and a strong correlation that was not significant between the CAIT score and the average HbO2 of the SMA (ρ = 0.52, P = .06).The CAI group displayed large differences in SMA cortical-activation variability. Greater variations in cortical activation may be necessary for similar static postural-control outcomes among individuals with CAI. Consequently, variations in cortical activation for these areas provide evidence for an altered neural mechanism of postural control among populations with CAI."

After determining the maximum isometric voluntary contraction of the hamstring and quadriceps, eight female athletes performed 3 repetitions of each exercise, while electromyography activity of the biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) was monitored. Comparisons between exercises revealed higher activation in BF (descending phase: p = 0.016, d = 1.36; ascending phase: p = 0.046, d = 1.11), ST (descending phase: p = 0.04, d = 1.87; ascending phase: p = 0.04, d = 1.87), VL (ascending phase: p = 0.04, d = 1.17) and VM (descending phase: p = 0.05, d = 1.11; ascending phase: p = 0.021, d = 1.133) muscles for the SLSB compared to the DLSQ. Furthermore, higher muscular activation of the ST (ascending phase: p = 0.01, d = 1.51; descending phase: p = 0.09, d = 0.96) and VM (ascending phase: p = 0.065, d = 1.03; descending phase: p = 0.062, d = 1.05) during the SLSB with respect to the DLSB was observed. In conclusion, the SLSB elicits higher neuromuscular activation in both hamstring and quadriceps muscles compared to the other two analysed exercises. Additionally, the higher muscle activation of both medial muscles (ST and VM) during the SLSB suggests that single leg squatting exercises may enhance lower limb medial to lateral balance, and improve knee stability in the frontal plane."

Search terms used were ""hamstring,"" ""repair,"" ""return to sport,"" and ""return to play."" Patients were assessed based on return to sport, return to preinjury activity level, type of HT tear (complete or partial), and interval from injury to surgery. Patients were also divided into subgroups depending on timing of the surgical intervention: early, <1 month; delayed, 1 to 6 months; and late, >6 months from the time of injury.Sixteen studies (one level 2, five level 3, ten level 4) met the inclusion criteria, including 374 patients with a complete proximal HT tear (CT group) and 93 patients with a partial proximal HT tear (PT group), with a mean follow-up of 2.9 years. Overall, 93.8% of patients (438/467) returned to sport, including 93.0% (348/374) in the CT group and 96.8% (90/93) in the PT group (P = .18). The mean time to return to sport was 5.7 months, and 83.5% of patients (330/395) returned to their preinjury activity level. The early group demonstrated the greatest rate of return to sport at 94.4% (186/197) as well as the quickest time to return at a mean of 4.8 months, although this was not found to be statistically significant.Over 90% of patients undergoing repair of a complete or partial proximal HT tear can be expected to return to sport regardless of the tear type. Early surgical interventions of these injuries may be associated with a quicker return to sport, although the rate of return to sport does not differ based on timing of the surgical intervention."

Modifying midsole stiffness of the basketball shoe has been reported to alter ankle motion and plantar forces to reduce the risk of injury; however, the effects on anatomical, in-shoe foot (metatarsal), motion is not well understood.The purpose of this study was to identify differences in foot and ankle biomechanics between basketball shoes with differing midsole stiffness values during single-leg jump landings. It was hypothesized that a stiffer midsole would elicit lower 1st metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) dorsiflexion angles, higher ankle dorsiflexion angles, and higher plantar forces and relative loading in the distal foot.Experimental cross-sectional study.Twenty high school and collegiate-aged basketball players performed a single-leg side drop jump and a single-leg cross drop jump in a pair of standard basketball shoes and a pair of shoes modified with a fiberglass plate to increase midsole stiffness. Three-dimensional motion analysis and flexible insoles quantified foot and ankle kinematics and plantar force distribution, respectively. Separate 2 (footwear) × 2 (task) repeated measures ANOVA models were used to analyze differences in 1) ankle kinematics, 2) 1st metatarsophalangeal kinematics, 3) maximal regional plantar forces, and 4) relative load.The stiffer shoe elicited decreased peak ankle plantarflexion (mean difference = 5.8 °, p = 0.01) and eversion (mean difference = 6.6 °, p = 0.03) and increased peak ankle dorsiflexion angles (mean difference = 5.0 °, p = 0.008) but no differences were observed in 1st MTPJ motion (p > 0.05). The stiffer shoe also resulted in lower peak plantar forces (mean difference = 24.2N, p = 0.004) and relative load (mean difference = 1.9%, p = 0.001) under the lesser toes.Altering the midsole stiffness in basketball shoes did not reduce motion at the MTPJ, indicating that added stiffness may reduce shoe motion, but does not reduce in-shoe anatomical motion. Instead, a stiffer midsole elicits other changes, including additional ankle joint motion and a reduction in plantar forces under the lesser toes. Collectively, this indicates that clinicians need to account for unintended compensations that can occur throughout the kinetic chain when altering a shoe property to alleviate a musculoskeletal injury.2b."

On the other hand, movements with rapid changes of direction, associated with the high traction of soccer cleats, can increase overload and risk of injuries. Given the lack of consensus on the effects of these cleats on mechanical overload during specific soccer movements, the aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of wearing cleats with bladed studs on mechanical overload in soccer. A search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases between October and November 2017. Non-original articles were excluded, as were those not related to soccer or cleats, and those not written in English. Eight articles were included that tested the effects of bladed studs on overload and that used biomechanical tests. The tasks evaluated were: running in a straight line or with changes of direction, and landing of jumps. The resulting joint torque, soil reaction force, electromyography, and plantar pressure were measured. There was no influence of bladed shaped studs on joint torque or on ground reaction force. There was an increase in plantar pressure on the lateral part of the foot in bladed studs compared to Society cleats and running shoes. When compared with round studs, the results were inconclusive for plantar pressure. Round studs, caused greater electromyographic activity in the quadriceps muscles than bladed studs. It was concluded that wearing bladed-stud cleats does not result in greater mechanical overload during running or landing of jumps. Evidence Level I, Systematic Review."

The side-to-side difference (SSD) of posterior tibial translation (PTT) improved from 18.4 ± 9.2 mm (range, 12.9-25.6 mm) to 5.2 ± 5.0 mm (range, -5.0-18.5 mm, P < 0.001), and the SSD of tibial external rotation by dial test (ER) decreased from 18.0° ± 14.4° (range, 13.0°-22.0°) to 1.2° ± 7.5° (range, -9.0°-22.0°, P < 0.001). In patients with type C injury, the SSD of the lateral opening decreased from 14.2 ± 6.6 mm (range, 22-10.2 mm) to 0.9 ± 3.1 mm (range, -4.4-6 mm, P < 0.001). In a comparison between patients with positive and negative LGDT signs, the LGDT-negative patients had significant superiority in subjective scores, SSD of PTT, and SSD of ER. The sensitivity and specificity of the LGDT test in detecting postoperative posterolateral rotational instability (PLRI) were calculated as 100% and 88.4%, respectively.In the series of surgically treated patients with PCL and PLC injury: (i) patients had improved subjective and objective clinical outcome after combined PCL reconstruction and PLC surgery at a minimum of 24-months follow-up; and (ii) second arthroscopic LGDT sign testing had high sensitivity and specificity in detecting postoperative PLRI, and a positive LGDT sign was related with inferior subjective and objective results."

Group differences were analyzed using independent-samples t tests. Paired-samples t tests were used for a comparison of the operated and nonoperated hips. Standard effect sizes (Cohen d) were provided for all outcomes.The HA group reported worse subjective hip function than the control group (HAGOS subscores: d = -0.7 to -2.1; P ≤ .004). Objective measures of hip ROM (d = -0.5 to -1.1; P ≤ .048), hip flexion strength (d = -0.5; P = .043), and posteromedial reach of the YBT (d = -0.5; P = .043) were also reduced in the HA group, although there were no significant differences between groups regarding the remaining objective measures (d = -0.1 to -0.4; P ≥ .102 to .534). The only significant difference between the operated and nonoperated hips in the HA group was reduced passive hip flexion (d = -0.4; P = .045).Patients who had undergone HA demonstrated reduced subjective hip function compared with controls 6 to 10 months after surgery, when return to sports can be expected. While most objective strength and performance test results were comparable between the HA and control groups at 6 to 10 months after surgery, the HA group presented with impairments related to hip mobility and hip flexion strength. No consistent pattern of impairments was found in operated hips compared with nonoperated hips."

Knowledge of patient complaints and clinical findings are crucial for adequate interpretation of imaging examinations. However, asymptomatic athletes can present abnormal imaging findings, and clinical presentation of hip injuries may be nonspecific. Therefore, a thorough examination of the hip and surrounding soft tissue images is essential. This review describes the intra-articular pathologies encountered in sports activities including labrum or cartilage lesions, associated or not with femoroacetabular hip impingement syndromes, as well as ligament teres injuries, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography arthrography. Different causes of snapping hip syndrome (from intra- and extra-articular origins) are also discussed and illustrated. The extra-articular forms of hip impingement syndromes including ischiofemoral and subspine impingement are depicted with MRI and ultrasound. Diagnostic imaging of bone avulsions, greater trochanteric syndrome, athletic pubalgia, and myotendinous injuries is also described."

Increased awareness among physicians is necessary as PCHA pathology (PCHAP) might be underdiagnosed. Knowledge of sports and professions at risk and risk-factors for obtaining PCHAP is essential for the development of future preventive measures. This study aims to identify sports and professions at risk as well as risk factors for PCHAP.The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were systematically searched.Twenty-seven papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and described 67 patients with PCHAP involved in seven sports and three professions. The sports (number of cases) were volleyball (41), baseball (13), swimming (1), tennis (3), American football (2), canoeing (1) and yoga (1) (2 unknown). The professions included a baseball coach, a circus trapeze artist and a mechanic. Apart from expert opinions, no studies have identified risk factors for PCHAP. An anatomic variation of the PCHA origin is suggested to be protective for PCHAP.PCHAP is reported in seven overhead sports and three professions. No risk factors for PCHAP were identified. An anatomic variant of the PCHA origin was found to be a potential protective factor for PCHAP. Physicians should be cautious for distal embolization as a result of PCHAP in athletes and workers, both adult and adolescent, involved in repetitive powerful overhead movements."
https://openalex.org/W2965574761,A Multi-body Simulation Framework for Live Motion Tracking and Analysis within the Unity Environment,2019-06-01,2019,article,"Synthesizing motion de novo for dynamic virtual organisms in a physics-based, virtual environment is presently intractable. Multi-body simulation development within current software systems is often cumbersome and interfacing third-party hardware (i.e. VR equipment, IMUs, haptic systems) is usually not straightforward for the average developer. Developing a simulation framework within a widely supported engine, such as Unity or Unreal Engine, would be much more practical because the resulting products can be designed to be scalable, highly customizable, easy-to-use, and open source. In this paper, we present a Unity-based multi-body simulation framework that can be used to simultaneously track and analyze human motion. The framework incorporates the musculoskeletal models derived from OpenSim and utilizes runtime-derived, closed-form definitions for muscle routing kinematics and kinematic Jacobians. The framework can be used to simulate multiple dynamic models simultaneously. Also, being integrated with the Unity environment, the framework naturally provides intuitive customization and third-party system integration. To demonstrate the performance and motion analysis capabilities of the framework, the paper also presents a live test simulation in which the muscular effort values of three different bicep curl forms were calculated while simultaneously tracking the tasks' motion at 100 Hz. One prospective use of the proposed framework is virtual reality and haptic-augmented motion training. The live tracking and motion analysis capabilities of the framework will allow immediate and effective dynamic feedback towards task performance optimization."

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a short-term, three-week intensive neuromuscular training programme on the postural stability of professional soccer players and to establish whether lower-limb dominance affects one-leg stability. Material and methods. The experimental group consisted of 16 professional male soccer players, and the control group included 20 professional soccer players who did not undergo any additional training. The experimental group was provided with three-stage progressive training twice a day over a three-week period during the preparatory period and then trained twice per week in-season for a period of 5 months. The experimental subjects were evaluated with the use of a stabilographic platform before the programme, 3 weeks into the programme, and finally after 5 months from its commencement. Total centre of pressure (COP) sway path was measured during one leg stance for the dominant and non-dominant leg with eyes open and closed. Results. After three weeks of training, the experimental group showed a significantly shorter COP path for the measurements taken with both open (p &lt; 0.001; η2 = 0.28) and closed eyes (p &lt; 0.05; η2 = 0.09) compared to the initial results. It was found that the training effects were sustained five months into the training programme for the tests with eyes open (p &lt; 0.001) and eyes closed (p &lt; 0.05). The control group, however, showed no such improvement during that time. No differences were found between the limbs in either of the groups. Conclusions. Neuromuscular training can be effective for postural control improvement in professional male soccer players within a short period of time. Leg dominance does not affect one-leg stability."

Participatory dance, which uses the same articulators as sign languages plus additional ones, also demonstrates methods of reducing biomechanical effort, analogous to those seen in sign languages, and, again, limited by the need to maintain recognizability of the dance figures/phrases. However, when we look at performance language (here, sign poetry) and performance dance, we find a contrast: sign language poetry uses reduced and enhanced forms, while performance dance does not use reduced forms but often uses enhanced forms. We attribute this contrast to the different functions of the different types of language and dance, with attention to the notion of intention in performance dance."

For this work, we developed our own soccer data set through computer vision analysis of footage from a tactical overhead camera. This data set included X, Y, coordinates for the ball and players throughout, as well as passes, steals and goals. After a divergent creation process, we developed four main methods of sports soniﬁcation for entertainment. For the Tempo Variation and Pitch Variation methods, tempo or pitch is operationalized to demonstrate ball and player movement data. The Key Moments method features only pass, steal and goal data, while the Musical Moments method takes ex-isting music and attempts to align the track with important data points. Evaluation was done using a combination of qualitative focus groups and quantitative surveys, with 36 participants completing hour long sessions. Results indicated an overall preference for the Pitch Variation and Musical Moments methods, and revealed a robust trade-off between usability and enjoyability."

Methods An interview was conducted with 257 referees using a web application. With this tool, a monthly evaluation form was sent to the referees with questions that measured the incidence, location, and pain intensity of injuries with complaints of pain and time of leave, severity in games and training in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The numerical pain scale was used to classify the pain intensity of the lesions with pain complaint. Results There was no difference between the years studied in relation to injuries with pain complaints, both in games and in training. Mean values were 37.8/1,000 hours in games and 39.9/1,000 hours in training, with a mean incidence of “ injuries defined by time of leave” of 3.7/1,000 hours in games. The difference was significantly higher in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2014, and in training, the average incidence was 3.5/1,000 hours, with a significantly higher difference in 2012 compared to 2013 and 2014. Conclusion Lesions with pain complaints did not present a significant difference in games compared to training; in the lesions by time of leave, the incidence in games was higher than in training, and the most frequent type of injury was low-degree muscle pain, predominantly in the thigh and triceps surae.

The physical demands required by TG athletes largely remain unknown, and likely are dictated by the specific disciplines and equipment used. This study aimed at describing physiological capacity by investigating mechanical lower limb muscle function and its association with TG performance in 24 senior elite (12 males, 12 females) team gymnasts. Methods: Anthropometrical data as well as 25m sprint ability, repetitive jumps (RJ), countermovement jumping (CMJ), drop jumping from a height of 48cm (DJ48), maximal isometric leg press muscle strength (MVC) and rate of force development (RFD) were measured. Results: Significant sex differences (p<0.05) were observed for all variables, except MVC. Total sprint times were 3.36±0.1s in males vs. 3.70±0.1s in females, CMJ height 0.51±0.05 vs. 0.41±0.03m, DJ48 rebound height 0.43±0.06 vs. 0.34±0.06m, with no difference in concentric peak power production between CMJ and DJ48. MVC was 38.3±9.9N/kg in males vs. 36.4±9.2N/kg in females. In female gymnasts, correlations (r2=0.41-0.46, p<0.05) were found between trampette and tumbling performance and sprint ability. In male gymnasts, correlations (r2=0.44, p<0.05) emerged between trampette performance and relative RFD (%MVC/s). Conclusions: Moderate associations were found between mechanical lower limb muscle function and functional tumbling performance in male and female TeamGym, indicating that performance in elite TeamGym also relies on factors other than isolated mechanical muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2954970371,Clinical outcome 5 years after Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization of acute ACL ruptures,2019-06-01,2019,article,"Aims and Objectives: Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilisation (DIS) is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) preserving surgical procedure for acute ACL injuries. A braided suture and a threaded sleeve containing a preloaded spring fixed into the proximal tibia provides continuous biomechanical stability. In combination with mircofracturing, self-healing of the ACL is promoted. Materials and Methods: Between January and November 2013 65 patients with an acute ACL rupture treated by Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilisation (DIS) were included in this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were acute ACL injury, a positive Lachman test compared to the healthy contralateral side and closed growth plates. The following demographic patient data was preoperatively recorded: age, gender, weight, activity scores (Tegner, Lysholm, IKDC), type of injury, ap-translation of both knees measured by KT-1000 or Rolimeter, knee function and prior surgeries to the knees. Furthermore pivot shift test, acl rupture type, days until surgery, operating time, pre-existing pathologies and concomitant injuries were detected during surgery. The result of the reconstruction was assessed by rating it as anatomical, almost anatomical or non-anatomical. Patients were followed-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after surgery. Patient satisfaction was detected recorded on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale from 0-10. Results: 34 men and 31 women were included. Mean age was 32.6 years (range 15 to 62 years). More than 70% of the injuries were soccer or handball associated. In 24 patients meniscal tears had to be repaired and in 4 patients cartilage damages had to be treated. All patients could be examinated 5 years after surgery. Within the follow up period 8 reruptures occured which were treated by one-step ACL reconstruction using an ipsilateral semitendinosus autograft. 4 patients had to be revised performing an arthrolysis due to extension deficit. At 5 years, Tegner Score averaged at 4.9 (compared to 5.5 pre-operatively). IKDC had an average of 90 (98). Lysholm score was at 95 (99). Patient satisfaction was 8.5. Conclusion: With the use of DIS, ACL preserving restoration of knee joint kinematics and mid-term survival of the repaired ACL after acute acl rupture can be achieved. Perioperative morbidity is reduced since harvesting of tendon grafts is not required. In case of recurrent instability or rerupture, conventional ACL reconstruction can still be performed. Knee function scores have shown a good rehabilitation and return to pre-trauma activity levels. However, long-term results are required to confirm safety and effectivity of the presented technique."

However, the effects of these exercises in young handball athletes is not known. Objective To compare the effect of Olympic weightlifting training with traditional strength training on jumping, squatting and acceleration performance in young handball athletes. Ten female handball athletes were evaluated. After six weeks of regular training, the athletes underwent eight weeks of training specifically designed for the survey, with equivalence of the total volume of training and differences in the means used. The evaluations were performed after six weeks of regular training (Baseline), after four weeks of traditional strength training and after four weeks of Olympic weightlifting. Vertical Jumps with and without movement of the arms, acceleration of 10 m, 20 m and 30 m, and 1RM in squatting were quantified. Results Increases (p&lt;0.05) were observed in accelerations and squatting in the Olympic weightlifting and in squatting in the traditional strength training. Differences in coordination, time to activation of the gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris and gluteus maximus, peak force and power and rate of force development between the jumps and exercises used in the training are hypotheses to be considered for the different responses adaptations found in the jumps. Conclusion The Olympic weightlifting training resulted in an increase in accelerations and strength, but not in vertical jump performance in young handball athletes.

https://openalex.org/W2949341124,Traditional Indian sports – A case-control study on Kho Kho players investigating genomic instability and oxidative stress as a function of metabolic genotypes,2019-06-01,2019,article,"The beneficial effects of physical exercise regularly for overall well being, or for recreational or professional purposes are widely accepted in clinical practice and have from time immemorial been the reasons for performing traditional sports. On the contrary, there is also evidence implying increased oxidative stress and genetic damage from intensive exercising. Depending on the intensity, time, frequency and characteristics of exercises, there can be differential induction of oxidative stress and provocation of oxidation of cellular macromolecules (including DNA) and cellular dysfunction which can likely accumulate with age, physical attributes and increase the susceptibility to disease on one hand, while stimulating cell signalling pathways leading to cell adaptation and improved resistance to stress, on the other. In order to observe if continuous sports activities as in Kho Kho increase oxidation capacity, which can also provoke oxidation of cellular macromolecules, the effects on oxidative/antioxidant changes and DNA damage in professional Kho Kho players modulated by individual genetic differences were assessed. Kho Kho, a traditional Indian game of 'Tag', is an all-time favourite which requires endurance, agility and strength. Healthy Kho Kho players (20.27 ± 0.28 y; sports age 6.78 ± 0.52 y) and controls (20.90 ± 0.45 y) were matched for age, gender, BMI, VO2 max (maximal oxygen uptake), frequency of GSTT1 (present/null), M1 (present/null), SOD2 (C199T) polymorphisms but differed for variant allele frequencies of GSTP1 (A313G) and SOD2 (C47T). Players compared to controls had significantly increased levels of DNA damage (1.8x, 44.66 ± 1.68 vs. 23.85 ± 1.79 μm, p = 0.000), lipid (MDA) peroxidation (2x, 1.72 ± 0.06 vs. 0.83 ± 0.16 μmol/l, p = 0.000) and total antioxidant capacity (1.09x, 1.69 ± 0.06 vs. 1.11 ± 0.03 mmol Trolox equivalent/l, p = 0.000) but with no differences for SOD activity (94.99 ± 2.42 vs. 93.36 ± 2.54 U/ml, p = 0.935). These results suggest that the players have increased genetic damage and oxidative stress probably from the intense physical activity in the absence of other exposure(s) as other attributes were comparable in the study group. The players may therefore be at increased risk for susceptibility to cancer, various diseases and precocious age-related changes and should be sensitized to health risks related to regular intensive physical exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2952553639,Championing Physical Cultural Sciences,2019-06-01,2019,article,"Abstract The term “physical culture” is, first of all, associated (referring to the etymology of the word “culture” from the Latin “colo,-ere”, meaning “to cultivate”, “to inhabit” or “to honor”) with cultivation and taking care of the human “physis” – obviously in the context of social and natural environment. What matters in physical cultural reflection is not movement as such – as a purely physical phenomenon – but only such a form of movement which has been cultivated and attributed with conventionalized social values of symbolic and autotelic character. Biological sciences connected with the human being are traditionally – after MacFadden, among others – counted among physical cultural sciences. Because of the bodily foundations of human physical activity, they perform a significant cognitive function: they describe natural foundations of special forms of movement, but they are not offering knowledge of cultural character. As there are no values in the human being’s nature, the biological sciences within the institutional field of physical culture can with their separate methodological and theoretical assumptions only offer an auxiliary, supportive function. Physical cultural sciences are primarily dealing with the significant relations between humans in physical cultural practices, with knowledge of an axiological (ethical and aesthetical) and social (philosophical, sociological, pedagogical, historical or political) character. The alleged superiority of biological sciences within physical cultural sciences and the connected marginalization of the humanities – which constitute, after all, a necessary and hence an unquestionable foundation for cultural studies – is, therefore, a clear challenge in the institutional field of physical culture."
https://openalex.org/W2953759273,Evaluation Of A Novel Acl Injury Prevention Technique:can Martial Arts Fall Training (break-falling And Rolling) Alter The Lower Extremity At-risk Biomechanics In Soccer Athletes?,2019-06-01,2019,article,"PURPOSE: We propose that by introducing martial arts fall training (specifically break-falling and rolling), the neuropathways in these athletes will be trained to recognize and avoid at risk postures by having an alternative response. Given the absence of research utilizing martial arts falling techniques in other sports, this study aims to compare lower extremity biomechanics and risk factors in soccer athletes with fall training compared to those without. METHODS: 5 youth premier soccer athletes between the ages of 9 and 16 were recruited for participation. Subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. All subjects continued their usual soccer training. The intervention group completed a twice weekly 10-week training program in addition to their usual training, taught by a karate and aikido expert at the level of 3rdthdegree black belt. At baseline and after the 10 week program was completed, all subjects underwent a biomechanical evaluation that measured hip and knee movement/position in frontal, transverse, and sagittal planes at 4 different time points during a drop fall. A mixed factorial ANOVA model was used to determine the effects of the intervention training on the kinematic variables of interest. The between subjects' factor was treatment group (intervention and control) and the within subjects factor was time point (pre-intervention and post-intervention). The test of the interaction between group and time point was used to determine if the intervention produced change in the variables of interest. The alpha level of significance for this study is set at the 0.05 level. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in knee flexion in the sagittal plane at initial contact when comparing pre and post-intervention (-4.802 degrees, P <0.001). There was also a significant decrease in knee flexion in the sagittal plane at heel strike 33ms (-7.384 degrees, P<0.001). There was no significant change in any of the other motion points examined. CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant change in body mechanics when comparing pre and post-break falling intervention.Pprior research has shown that neuromuscular programs decrease ACL injury rates when they are started at an early age and continued with strong compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2953437079,Use Of A Clinic-Based ACL Prediction Algorithm In Division III Female Soccer And Basketball Players,2019-06-01,2019,article,"During landing and pivoting movements female athletes have an increased lower extremity valgus alignment and knee abduction moment (KAM) making them four to six times more likely than males to sustain a sports-related, non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. PURPOSE: To utilize a clinic-based ACL prediction algorithm developed by Myer, Ford and Hewett (2011) that determines the probability of high knee abduction moment (KAM) in Division III female soccer and basketball players. METHODS: Twenty female athletes were recruited (n = 10 basketball, n = 10 soccer). Five measures were obtained and utilized in the prediction algorithm, namely tibial length, body mass, knee valgus, knee flexion range of motion, and quadriceps-to-hamstring isokinetic strength ratio. A prediction nomogram was applied to award a point value for each variable, which when summed generated a probability of high knee abduction moment (KAM). High KAM is associated with a higher risk of ACL injury. In each group a dependent t-test was used to compare KAM in the left and right leg. Significance was tested at p <0.05. RESULTS: The probability of high KAM in basketball and soccer players was higher in the left leg compared to the right leg. In soccer players, this difference in KAM between the left and right leg was significant (basketball: L = 0.76 ± 0.27, R = 0.71 ± 0.24, t(9) = 0.82, p = 0.43; soccer: L = 0.64 ± 0.31, R = 0.49 ± 0.31, t(9) = 2.65, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The higher KAM scores for the basketball players suggest that they may be at a greater risk for ACL injury compared to the soccer players. The significant difference in bilateral KAM scores in the legs of the soccer players suggests a greater risk of ACL injury in the left leg compared to the right leg. This difference may be attributed to leg dominance, although leg dominance was not measured in this study. The current study supports the use of a clinic-based ACL prediction algorithm to evaluate ACL injury risk of athletes when advanced biomechanical equipment is unavailable. Identification of risk of ACL injury allows for potential implementation of injury prevention training."

METHODS: Six soccer players with a PG ACLR (age, 25.83 ± 4.44 years; height, 1.73 ± 0.04 m; weight, 70.91 ± 8.00 kg, BMI, 23.64 ± 3.29 kg/m2, time since surgery, 4 ± 3.38 years) and 6 soccer players with a HG ACLR (age, 26.83 ± 3.25 years; height, 1.69 ± 0.08 m; weight, 67 ± 6.16 kg, BMI, 23.40 ± 2.08 kg/m2 time since surgery, 5 ± 2.89 years) participated in the study. Planned landing (PL) included jumping forward and landing on two force plates, whereas unplanned landing (UL) included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force plates. Participants performed 4 trials of each landing task. Outcome measures included peak flexion angles and extension moments of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, and electromyography of gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles. A 2×2 ANOVA (group × landing) was performed for each measure. RESULTS: There were no significant group × landing interactions for any of the outcomes. Significant main effects of landing were found. The UL showed smaller hip flexion (F1,10 = 48.77, p < 0.001), smaller knee flexion (F1,10 = 28.02, p < 0.001), and lower ankle platarflexion moments (F1,10 = 26.48, p < 0.001). Significant main effects for group for quadriceps muscle and hip extension moments were found showing that the PG group landed with reduced quadriceps activity (F1,10 = 11.72, p = 0.007), and greater hip extension moments (F1,10 = 14.69, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The UL showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with the PL. Although the PG group showed nearly similar landing biomechanics to the HG group during both maneuvers, they (PG) demonstrated a protective landing pattern by reducing quadriceps activity and increasing the demand on the hip extensors. These findings reinforce the clinical emphasis on improving the use of hip and knee joints during landing to reduce the risk of consequent injuries in soccer players following PG ACLR."

However, in non-contact sports such as soccer, little is known about onfield head accelerations during soccer play, which limits the understanding of the risk and mechanism of head injury. PURPOSE: To assess the biomechanics underlying the risk of head injury during soccer play. METHODS: An instrumented headband was worn by 8 elite male (M) players (18 ± 0 yrs, 73.7 ± 9.5 kg, 1.73 ± 0.1 m) and 16 amateur female (F) players (24.1± 1.4 yrs, 63.5 ± 7.8 kg, 1.63 ± 0.1 m) during 7 (M) and 9 (F) games of a summer season. Head kinematics of each impact (peak linear and angular accelerations of the head) were grouped as heading techniques or involuntary impacts. Heading techniques were sub-categorized as jump, stable, head rotation or unstable. Involuntary impacts were sub-categorized as player-to-player contact, ball control (feet or chest), running (acceleration or deceleration), change-of-direction, ground impact, unstable or involuntary head-to-ball impact. Head kinematics were subjected to standard descriptive statistics. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare heading techniques and involuntary impacts kinematic. RESULTS: In total 239 head impacts were registered for M and 139 for F. Heading techniques accounted for 92 impacts for M (36g ± 15g; 4175 ± 2517 rad/s2) and 97 for F (33g ± 13g; 3334 ± 1747 rad/s2). Involuntary impacts accounted for 147 impacts for M (20g ± 9g; 1934 ± 1511 rad/s2) and 42 for F (21g ± 11g; 2095 ± 1603 rad/s2). For M and F, the average peak linear and angular accelerations of the head caused by heading techniques were associated with higher values than involuntary impacts (p < 0.05). For both M and F, the most frequent heading technique was the jump and player-to-player contact was the most frequent for involuntary impact. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results show that heading techniques can cause higher values of head accelerations than involuntary impacts and therefore, could cause a higher risk of head injury in two different populations of players. Grant funding: this study was funded using NSERC and FRQNT research grants."

The effects of PAD on impact attenuation and injury risks of human movements are still relatively unknown. PURPOSE: To examine impact attenuation related ankle biomechanical characteristics of a 90° cutting movement on synthetic turf with shock pad compared to synthetic turf only. METHODS: Twelve recreational football and soccer players performed five successful trials of 90° cutting movement in each of two approaching speed conditions: 3.0±0.3 (SLOW) and 4.0±0.4 (FAST) m/s on each of TURF and PAD surface conditions. Three-dimensional kinematic and ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected simultaneously. A 2"" monofilament synthetic turf with 1/2"" stitch gauge was used in TURF and PAD conditions. A foam-based shock pad was used in PAD condition. RESULTS: No significant surface main effect or surface by speed interactions were found for any ankle kinematic and kinetic variables and peak GRFs (p > 0.05). Increased peak ankle eversion moment (0.65 vs. 0.84 Nm/kg, p<0.001) and inversion loading range of motion (ROM, 13.7 vs. 18.6 deg, p=0.001) were seen in FAST compared to SLOW. Increases for peak ankle sagittal-plane concentric pushoff power, and frontal-plane eccentric and concentric power were also observed in FAST compared to SLOW. Peak vertical (2.04 vs. 2.31 BW, p=0.023) and medial loading (0.79 vs. 1.11 BW, p=0.002) GRFs were higher in FAST than SLOW. Additionally, peak pushoff medial GRFs were increased from SLOW to FAST (0.91 vs. 1.20 BW, p=0.025), but pushoff vertical GRFs were decreased slightly (2.24 vs. 2.11 BW, p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant differences between TURF and PAD and their interactions for examined ankle and GRF variables suggest that adding a form-based shock pad does not impede cutting performance. These results also seem to indicate there is a neuromuscular accommodation in cutting mechanics on PAD surface, which cannot be reflected loading variables using inverse dynamics. As cutting speed increased, greater increases in medial peak GRFs, and frontal-plane peak ankle moment and ROM were observed compared to those in sagittal-plane, suggesting increased mediolateral loading to ankle complex in fast cut movement.

PURPOSE: To examine overall and age-specific HI exposure and magnitude in youth flag football. METHODS: Five youth flag football teams (n = 35, age = 8.5 ± 1.1 yrs, height = 138.5 ± 10.5cm, mass = 35.3 ± 8.8kg) comprised of two age groups (7-8Us and 9-10Us) wore HI sensors (Triax Sim-G) during practice and game sessions over one season. Sensors recorded HI frequency, linear (g), and rotational acceleration (rad/s2). Athlete exposure was calculated as one player participating in one practice or game session. Impact rates (IR) were calculated as impacts per 10 athlete exposures. Impact rate ratios (IRR) compared session type and age groups. Acceleration values were placed into low- and high-magnitude categories via median splits. Magnitude category frequencies were compared between age groups using χ2 tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: We observed 203 overall flag football HIs (127 game, 76 practice; 5.8 impacts/player; 0.56 impacts/exposure). Overall median linear acceleration was 32.7g (16.0g - 100.9g) and angular acceleration was 4,300 rad/s2 (1,000rad/s2 - 12,500rad/s2). 90th percentile accelerations were 63.0g and 8,400 rad/s2 during games and 49.5g and 8,200 rad/s2 during practices. Players experienced significantly higher IRs during practices than games (IRR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.16-2.05). There were no age group HI differences overall (IRR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.83-1.51) or for games (IRR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.80-1.64). Practices resulted in 1.80 times the IR (95% CI: 1.02 - 3.17) in the 9-10Us compared to the 7-8Us. No significant associations between age groups were observed for low- and high-magnitude HIs for linear (p = 0.73) or angular acceleration (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Flag football players experienced a low-frequency of HIs and relatively high-impact magnitudes, but whether high-frequency or magnitude HIs contribute to neurodegeneration is unknown. Practices had greater odds for HI frequencies than games, suggesting practice modifications can further decrease total HI. The 9-10Us experienced greater HI frequencies, potentially indicating more aggressive or risky game play with age."

The historical derivation of current operational definitions of uncomplicated concussive brain injury based on acute injury variables especially posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) vs. symptom presence (no PTA) are reviewed.Methods: Major milestones from 150 plus years of concussion research include (a) railway spine; (b) traumatic neurosis; (c) duration of loss of consciousness predicting severity of brain injury; (d) early neuropsychological studies; (e) sport related concussion; and (f) chronic traumatic encephalopathy.Results: After initial organic explanations proved untenable, 19th century conceptions of concussion were operationally defined from symptom presence, attributed primarily to psychogenic (emotional, motivational, and/or predispositional) causes. In the 1930s, duration of PTA was linked to brain injury severity via outcome studies. Concussion (as defined by PTA < 1 h) was later found to cause a transient lowering of neuropsychological test scores in memory and executive function. In the 1990s, organizational definitions of sport-related concussion began to include biomechanical events without PTA that produced symptoms. Such events have not been linked to neuropsychological impairment.Conclusions: Two differing operational definitions of concussion are in the current use, involving the presence vs. absence of PTA. These two groupings are not clinically similar, although they are currently being widely treated as such. Operational definitions of concussion should address both minimum and maximums for duration of PTA, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, complications, and symptom presence."

The investment toward, participation in, and consumption of the sport has surged in the years following the Chinese Communist Party’s implementation of major 2015 reforms intended to (1) develop the domestic professional football league, (2) grow the sport’s popularity among the country’s 1.4 billion population, (3) increase youth participation, (4) develop the national team to be the best team in Asia, and (5) aggressively bid for a men’s FIFA World Cup. Despite these significant levels of State and private investment theretoward, there are still significant concerns within the Chinese and international media publics about the footballing nation—specifically as related to the performance of the Chinese men’s national team. In this article, we present a comparative analysis of Chinese- and English-language news media representations that frame how east and west media publics might “read” various aspects of Chinese football (commercial, cultural, ideological, etc.). In so doing, we identify and analyze major themes which, as popularized in different popular media contexts, articulate the men’s national team’s performance to broader (inter)national anxieties about the state of football and the geopolitical trajectories of the People’s Republic."

The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) has been used to assess the neuromuscular control of landing mechanics for the first landing in a drop vertical jump (DVJ) task. However, the second DVJ landing may provide different results, warranting assessment.(1) LESS scores will differ between first and second DVJ landings across all female participants with (2) greater intraparticipant variability among the second landing compared with the first landing scores.Cross-sectional study.Level 4.A total of 13 gymnasts and 31 softball players (N = 44) performed 3 DVJ trials. The mean ± SD age of 44 female athletes was 16.46 ± 2.59 years. The LESS was scored using 2-dimensional video of each trial.There was a significant difference between the first and second DVJ landings (P < 0.01). All participants demonstrated higher LESS scores (worse landing mechanics) during the second DVJ landing (10.10 ± 2.25) than the first landing (6.97 ± 2.72).The initial landing in a DVJ has been the focus of neuromuscular control studies using the LESS. This study found worse neuromuscular control during the second DVJ landing, which highlights the importance of evaluating landing mechanics beyond the initial landing.LESS analysis of both DVJ landings might improve neuromuscular control screening in female athletes and augment lower extremity and anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programs."

However, the effects of RHI on sensory processing for balance control is unknown and may have significant clinical implications if athletes are still participating in sport despite impairments. Research Question Are there changes in sensory processing for balance control during standing and walking following RHI? Methods Thirty healthy, adult, amateur soccer players (15 males, 15 females, 21.8±2.8 years, 69.9±11.5 kg, 171.4±8.2 cm) volunteered for the standing balance assessment (i.e., experiment 1). A distinct cohort of twenty healthy, adult, amateur soccer players (10 males, 10 females, 22.3±4.5 years, 70.0±10.5 kg, 170.5±9.8 cm) volunteered for the walking balance assessment (i.e., experiment 2). We used a repeated measures design across three time points (pre-heading, 0-hours post-heading, 24-hours post-heading). Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (i.e., performed 10 soccer headers in 10 minutes) or a control group (i.e., did not perform any soccer heading between sessions). In experiment 1, participants stood in a virtual reality cave while experiencing simultaneous perturbations to their visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems. In experiment 2, participants walked blindfolded along a foam walkway and experienced a vestibular perturbation on the second heel strike of the right foot. Changes in sensory processing were assessed using repeated measures ANOVAs. Results There were no changes in sensory reweighting during experiment 1 and no changes in balance responses to the vestibular stimulus in experiment 2. Significance Although the cumulative effects of RHI may result in later-life cognitive, behavioral, and mood impairments, a single episode of repeated soccer headers does not appear to be associated with acute impairments in sensory processing for balance control."

To demonstrate the use of machine-learning for reducing questionnaireresponse burden, we created multiple, shorter versions of the Mindfulness Inventory for Sport. We then tested the reliability and validity of scores derived from these shorter versions in athletic populations.Design. We used genetic algorithms to shorten the measure, and both cross-sectional and longitudinal data to test psychometric properties.Method. We collected data from 859 undergraduate exercise science students and 118 golfers. We used 75% of the student sample to shorten the measure, and the rest of the data to test the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, content validity, and factorial validity. For criterion validity, we explored relationships between the subscales and other measures of mindfulness, golf handicaps, and an objective measure of putting accuracy.Results. Genetic algorithms efficiently generated stable solutions to shortening the measure. Reliability decreased as the measure become shorter—especially between three and two items per subscale—but remained acceptable. Validity metrics for shorter versions were as good, and sometimes better, than the full questionnaire. Awareness and refocusing subscales demonstrated weak associations with golf handicap for long and short versions. Non-judgment showed no significant associations, and no subscales significantly predicted putting performance.Conclusions. Genetic algorithms provide efficient solutions to reducing questionnaire response burden for athletes."

Figure skaters may experience different body-related expectations based on gender despite performing in identical or similar training and competition environments. In a qualitative investigation that examined body pressure experiences of male skaters, participants discussed some of their struggles, but seemed compelled to discuss, unexpectedly, the plight of female skaters in facing the skating body ideal. The present findings represent an exploratory analysis of qualitative data elucidating the body pressure experiences of female skaters through the eyes of male skaters. Participants were 13 competitive male figure skaters ages 16–24 ( M = 18.53). Analyzed using a social constructivist and critical perspective, the results demonstrated the salience of body pressures for female skaters and afforded insight into sociocultural and historical factors that influence how male and female skaters experience their bodies differently in a skating context. Male skaters reported they faced less extreme body pressures, had certain physical advantages, and tended to be more confident than female skaters, which underscored a gendered body pressure experience. This work explores the intersections of gender and power within figure skating and examines body image concerns and unhealthy eating and exercise behaviors as a larger social justice issue that serves to encourage similar investigations in other sports."

However HSI still exhibit high injury/re-injury rates and new areas of research must be thoroughly explored. Deficiencies that impact the close relationship between the nervous system and muscle functioning constitute a promising research direction, according to existing literature.Objectives: To outline the often-overlooked factors that pre-dispose to hamstring neuromuscular deficits, with a special emphasis on hamstring strain injury and re-injury.Major Findings: Sensory input impairment, neural tension, fatigue, competitive anxiety and lumbar-pelvic motor control deficit can all induce dysregulations of the hamstring neuromuscular functioning that may be detrimental during high-speed running. They constitute therefore serious risk factors for hamstring strain injury and re-injury.Conclusions: We devised an intervention algorithm including both evaluation procedures and hamstring management plan, by compiling and adjusting the most promising doctrines of the literature reviewed. Further research, such as randomized controlled trials, is required to provide evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of this algorithm for patients in post-HSI recovery or as a preventive approach in the event of high suspicion of re-injury."

Adults decided which of five backpacks (10–30 cm thick) they would be able to wear while low crawling under barriers. Participants were assigned to one of three experience conditions. Participants in the Pre/Post-choice experience condition crawled under the barrier before and after picking a backpack, participants in the Feedback condition crawled under the barrier after picking a backpack, but participants in the No Experience condition received no low-crawling experience. Past research suggests that pre-choice experience with low crawling under the barrier would lead to more accurate responses. Overall, participants in all three conditions scaled the height of the backpack to the barrier height. Pre-choice low-crawling experience strongly influenced backpack choices such that participants in the Pre/Post condition picked significantly smaller backpacks and produced fewer failures than participants in the other conditions. The results provide evidence that brief practice, in an unfamiliar posture, can lead to improvements in affordance perception."
https://openalex.org/W2946938553,Modeling sports‐related mild traumatic brain injury in animals—A systematic review,2019-05-28,2019,review,"Sports-related head trauma has emerged as an important public health issue, as mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) may result in neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Research into mTBI and CTE pathophysiology are difficult to undertake in athletes, with observational trials and post-mortem analysis the current mainstays. Thus, animal models play an important role in the study of mTBI, however, traditional animal models have focused on acute, severe injuries rather than the more typical mTBI's seen in sport injuries. Recently, a number of animal models have been developed that are both appropriately scaled and biomechanically relevant to the forces sustained by athletes. This review aimed to examine the literature for variables included in these animal models, and the resulting neurotrauma as evidenced by pathology and behavioral deficits. A systematic search of the literature was performed in multiple electronic databases. The inclusion criteria required mimicry of athlete mTBI conditions: freedom of head movement, lack of surgical alteration of the skull, and application of direct contact force. Studies were analyzed for variables including apparatus design features (impact force, change in animal head velocity, and kinetic energy transfer to the head), demonstrated pathology (phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 aggregation, diffuse axonal injury, gliosis, cytokine inflammation response, and genetic integrity), and behavioral changes. These studies suggested that appropriate animal models can assist in understanding the pathological and functional outcomes of athlete mTBI, and could be used as a platform for future studies of diagnostic/prognostic markers and in the development of treatment interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2946932878,PET Evaluation of Microglial Activation in Non-neurodegenerative Brain Diseases,2019-05-28,2019,review,"Purpose of the Review: Microglial cell activation is an important component of neuroinflammation, and it is generally well accepted that chronic microglial activation is indicative of accumulating tissue damage in neurodegenerative conditions, particularly in the earlier stages of disease. Until recently, there has been less focus on the role of neuroinflammation in other forms of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Through this review, we hope to demonstrate the important role TSPO PET imaging has played in illuminating the pivotal role of neuroinflammation and microglial activation underpinning these conditions. Recent Findings: TSPO is an 18 kDa protein found on the outer membrane of mitochondria and can act as a marker of microglial activation using nuclear imaging. Through the development of radiopharmaceuticals targeting TSPO, researchers have been able to better characterise the spatial-temporal evolution of chronic neurological conditions, ranging from the focal autoimmune reactions seen in multiple sclerosis to the Wallerian degeneration at remote parts of the brain months following acute cerebral infarction. Summary: Development of novel techniques to investigate neuroinflammation within the central nervous system, for the purposes of diagnosis and therapeutics, has flourished over the past few decades. TSPO has proven itself a robust and sensitive biomarker of microglial activation and neuroimaging affords a minimally invasive technique to characterise neuroinflammatory processes in vivo."

A network theoretical “social” model is proposed as a tool to explore and understand the dynamics of prestige in the academic hierarchy. It is observed that such a model naturally gives rise to the idea that the prestige associated with a node in the graph (the prestige of an individual academic) can be viewed as a dynamic quantity that evolves with time based on both local and non-local changes in the properties in the network. The toy model studied here includes both supervisor-student and examiner-student relationships. This gives an insight into some of the key features of academic genealogies and naturally leads to a proposed model for “prestige propagation” on academic networks. This propagation is not solely directed forward in time (from teacher to progeny) but sometimes also flows in the other direction. As collaborators do well, this reflects well on those with whom they choose to collaborate and those that taught them. Furthermore, prestige as a quantity continues to be dynamic even after the end of a relationship or career. Given that time ordering of relationships on the network are implicit but that measures such as betweenness are independent of this implicit time dependence: the success of a PhD student later in their career can improve the prestige of their doctoral supervisor. Thus, prestige can be interpreted to have dynamics that flow both forward and backward in time."

Data Sources To develop the current standards and identify current best-practices evidence, the task force used a multistep process that included reviewing the existing 2004 Appropriate Medical Care for Secondary School–Aged Athletes consensus points and cross-referencing of National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) statements and official documents from the strategic alliance (the NATA, NATA Foundation, Board of Certification, and Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education). Gaps in the recommendations from the 2004 Appropriate Medical Care for Secondary School–Aged Athletes document were identified by the task force, and the new appropriate medical care standards were developed and refined. Conclusions and Recommendations Twelve standards, with supporting substandards, were developed that encompassed readiness to participate in activity; facilities; equipment; protective materials; environmental policies; nutrition, hydration, and dietary supplementation; wellness and long-term health; comprehensive emergency action plans; on-site immediate care; on-site therapeutic interventions; psychological concerns; and athletic health care administration. Collectively, these standards describe a comprehensive approach to providing appropriate health care to secondary school–aged athletes and should serve as a framework with which organizations can evaluate and improve the medical care supplied to adolescent athletes."

However, force-velocity-power (F-v-P) profiling recently showed high reliability and validity in trained adults. Therefore, the aim was to determine the reliability of F-v-P profiling in children and adolescents. Seventy-five children (60 boys, 15 girls; age: 14.1 ± 2.6 years) completed three 30 m sprints. Velocity was measured at 46.875 Hz using a radar device. The F-v-P profile was fitted to a velocity-time curve allowing instantaneous power variables to be calculated. Reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest worthwhile change (SWC). High reliability was evident for absolute peak (Ppeak) and mean power (Pmean), Ppeak and Pmean expressed relative to body mass, peak and mean velocity, 30 m sprint time, peak horizontal force (F0), relative F0, mechanical efficiency index and fatigue rate (ICC: 0.75-0.88; CV: 1.9-9.4%) with time to peak power demonstrating moderate reliability (ICC: 0.50; CV: 9.5%). The F-v-P model demonstrated at least moderate reliability for all variables. This therefore provides a potential alternative for paediatric researchers assessing sprint performance and the underlying kinetics."

The medical literature on this topic was reviewed in order to compare the findings related to boxing with those related to football. The evidence gathered from this review indicates that there are significant differences between the clinical and neuropathological descriptions of the chronic brain damage reported in retired boxers compared to those reported in retired football players. Differing biomechanics of head impacts in the two sports may help explain the different clinical and neuropathological consequences of participation in boxing versus football.

A retrospective analysis of head injuries and helmet damage from real-world equestrian accidents,2019-05-24,2019,article,"To collect and analyse helmets from real-world equestrian accidents. To record reported head injuries associated with those accidents. To compare damage to helmets certified to different standards and the injuries associated with them. Two hundred sixteen equestrian helmets were collected in total. One hundred seventy-six helmets from amateur jockeys were collected via accident helmet return schemes in the UK and USA, while 40 helmets from professional jockeys were collected by The Irish Turf Club. All helmet damage was measured, and associated head injury was recorded. Eighty-eight percent (189) of equestrian fall accidents returned an injury report of which 70% (139) reported a head injury. Fifty-four percent (75) of head injury cases had associated helmet damage while 46% had no helmet damage. Reported head injuries consisted of 91% (126) concussion, 4% (6) skull fractures, 1 (0.7%) subdural hematoma, 1 (0.7%) cerebral edema and 5 (3.6%) diffuse axonal injury (DAI). It is also shown that helmets certified to the most severe standard are overrepresented in this undamaged group (p <0.001). It is clear that despite jockeys wearing a helmet, large proportions of concussion injuries still occur in the event of a jockey sustaining a fall. However, the data suggest it is likely that helmets reduce the severity of head injury as the occurrence of skull fracture is low. The proportion of undamaged helmets with an associated head injury suggests that many helmets may be too stiff relative to the surface they are impacting to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI). It may be possible to improve helmet designs and certification tests to reduce the risk of head injury in low-severity impacts."

Eleven elite cyclists obtained a one-week baseline of habitual sleep then restricted sleep to 4 h/night (SR) for three nights assessed through self-report and actigraphy. Pre and post-intervention measures were a box drop maximal vertical jump with 3D motion capture to assess physical performance and biomechanical changes, and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) assessed changes in response time. Associations between biomechanical, physical, and cognitive performance measures were assessed. Participants restricted reported sleep from 7.4 ± 0.5 h/night at baseline to 4.0 ± 0.2 h/night and actigraphy indicated 6.7 ± 0.7 to 3.7 ± 0.2 h/night. Following SR, jump height decreased (0.44 ± 0.09 vs. 0.42 ± 0.10 m, p = 0.02, g = 0.21). Hip sagittal/knee frontal (Δ15.5°, p = 0.04, g = 0.40) and hip frontal/knee frontal (Δ11.0°, p < 0.01, g = 0.44) plane coordination variability increased after SR. Hip sagittal/knee frontal plane coordination variability after SR was associated with increasingly slower PVT response time (r = 0.63, p = 0.03). These findings suggest SR for three days decreased maximal jump performance. SR increased joint coordination variability and was associated with greater impairment in response time. SR leads to deviations from preferred movement patterns, which may have implications for decrements in athlete performance and increased injury risk."

In some instances, the effects of sports-related head injury are long-lasting. Due to their still-developing brains, adolescents appear to be more vulnerable to long-term repercussions of these injuries. In this review we will examine the pathophysiology of mTBI, its acute effects and long-term risks from sustaining injury, and current and needed advancements in the areas of neuropsychological testing, accelerometer telemetry, and neuroimaging. Current methods do not adequately measure the extent of an injury that an athlete may sustain, potentially putting these athletes at a much greater risk for long-term effects. To better understand mTBI, neuropsychological testing best practices need to be developed, standardized, and implemented based on sound scientific evidence in order to be propagated as clinical guidelines. Wearable accelerometers can be used to assess thresholds for mTBI and cumulative effects of concussive and subconcussive injuries. Novel neuroimaging methods that can detect anatomical abnormalities and functional deficits with more specificity and sensitivity should be developed. Young athletes are particularly a vulnerable population warranting immediate and significant research aimed at protecting them against sports related injury and mitigating their long-term deficits."

Investigate the predictive relationship between 100 m front crawl swimming performance of youth swimmers and anthropometric characteristics. Materials and methods. Fifty-one active athletes (n = 30 male and n = 21 female) participated in the research and for the purposes of the analysis were divided into two categories (13–15 years n = 32, and 16–18 years old, n = 19). The following anthropometric data were used as set of predictive variables (7 longitudinal, 7 skinfolds, 3 circumference and 1 voluminosity variables). Results. One prediction model for each gender and age group emerged. The percentage of the explained variance of the dependent variable (100 m front crawl performance time) is 84.6 %, 54.4 %, 71.1 % and 72.7 % respectively for male, female, youth and cadet swimmers. The significant variables for each model were: arm span, biceps skinfold, biceps bracchi circumference in contraction for male swimmers, sitting height for female swimmers, biceps bracchi circumference in contraction and body weight for youth swimmers, triceps skinfold and biceps bracchi circumference in contraction for cadet swimmers. Conclusion. Youth swimmers’ performance can be predicted by important anthropometric parameters."

The objective of this study was to determine the reliability and accuracy of a wearable head impact sensor: xPatch, X2Biosystems, Inc. The skin-mounted sensor, xPatch, was fixed onto a Hybrid III headform and dropped using an impact test rig. A total of 400 impacts were performed, ranging from 20g to 200g linear acceleration, and impact velocities of 1.2 - 3.9 m/s. During each impact, the peak linear acceleration, angular velocity and angular acceleration were recorded and compared to the reference calibrated data. Impacts were also recorded using a high-speed video camera. The results show that the linear acceleration recorded by the xPatch during frontal and side impacts had errors of up to 24% when compared to the referenced data. The angular velocity and angular acceleration had substantially larger errors of up to 47.5% and 57%, respectively. The location of the impact had a significant effect on the results: if the impact was to the side of the head, the device on that side may have an error of up to 71%, thus highlighting the importance of device location. All impacts were recorded using two separate xPatches and, in certain cases, the difference in angular velocity between the devices was 43%. In conclusion, the xPatch can be useful for identifying impacts and recording linear accelerations during front and side impacts, but the rotational velocity and acceleration data need to be interpreted with caution."

Both male and female paddlers presented significant differences and large effect sizes in muscle mass and skin mass values (η2p > .64) whereas bone mass and fat mass remained stable from the 1st to the 3rd year. Proportionality analysis revealed girths and breadths differences in arm and chest variables as well as large effect sizes in biacromial breadth among all years (η2p > .62; p < .05), particularly in boys. Similarly, significant improvements in 200-m performance times were observed for both sexes.Conclusions: The findings of the current investigation might suggest a tendency towards a leaner and more robust morphological profile of elite paddlers in the transition from young to senior categories. In addition, the presence of superior relative body dimensions from young categories seems to be paramount in the evolution to later successful paddling."
https://openalex.org/W2946520717,Influence of the structural components of artificial turf systems on impact attenuation in amateur football players,2019-05-23,2019,article,"Abstract The purpose of this research was to evaluate the influence of the structural components of different 3rd generation artificial turf football field systems on the biomechanical response of impact attenuation in amateur football players. A total of 12 amateur football players (24.3 ± 3.7 years, 73.5 ± 5.5 kg, 178.3 ± 4.1 cm and 13.7 ± 4.3 years of sport experience) were evaluated on three third generation artificial turf systems (ATS) with different structural components. ATS were composed of asphalt sub-base and 45 mm of fibre height with (ATS1) and without (ATS2) elastic layer or compacted granular sub-base, 60 mm of fibre height without elastic layer (ATS3). Two triaxial accelerometers were firmly taped to the forehead and the distal end of the right tibia of each individual. The results reveal a higher force reduction on ATS3 in comparison to ATS1 (+6.24%, CI95%: 1.67 to 10.92, ES: 1.07; p &lt; 0.05) and ATS2 (+21.08%, CI95%: 16.51 to 25.66, ES: 2.98; p &lt; 0.05) elastic layer. Tibia acceleration rate was lower on ATS3 than ATS1 (−0.32, CI95%: −0.60 to −0.03, ES: 4.23; p &lt; 0.05) and ATS2 (−0.35, CI95%: −0.64 to −0.06; ES: 4.69; p &lt; 0.05) at 3.3 m/s. A very large correlation ( r = 0.7 to 0.9; p &lt; 0.05) was found between energy restitution and fibre height in both head and tibial peak acceleration and stride time. In conclusion, structural components (fibre height, infill, sub-base and elastic layer) determine the mechanical properties of artificial turf fields. A higher force reduction and lower energy restitution diminished the impact received by the player which could protect against injuries associated with impacts compared to harder artificial turf surfaces."

Objective To discuss the current evidence as it relates to prophylactic programs for the prevention of ankle sprains and to provide critical interpretation of the evidence supporting and refuting the implementation of preventive programs. Conclusions External prophylactic supports and preventive exercise programs are effective for reducing the risk of ankle sprains in both uninjured and previously injured populations.

A review of data from the North Texas Concussion Network Prospective Registry (ConTex) was performed. Participants were diagnosed with a sport-related concussion and were ≤18 years old. Participants were categorized based on their initial clinic visit Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index composite score (0-21) into good sleep quality (GS≤5) and poor sleep quality (PS>5) groups. The PS group reported higher median total symptom scores at 3-month follow-up (3.0 vs 0.0, P < .01) and took more than a median of 2 weeks longer to recover compared to the GS group (35.0 days vs 20.0 days, P < .01). Poor sleep quality was strongly associated with greater symptom severity and longer time to recovery following sport-related concussion. Early recognition of concussed athletes with poor sleep quality at initial clinic visit may help predict prolonged recovery."

Sixty-six inactive untrained male subjects (age: 39.3 ± 5.8 years, VO2max : 41.2 ± 6.2 mL kg-1 min-1 , body mass: 81.9 ± 10.8 kg, height: 173.2 ± 6.4 cm) were evaluated. On separate occasions, the players were randomly submitted to a progressive VO2max TT, to the Yo-Yo intermittent endurance level 1 (YYIE1) and level 2 (YYIE2) tests, to the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 (YYIR1) test, and to 7v7 (43 × 27 m pitch, 83 m2 /player) football matches (45 minutes; 2-4 matches/player). To ensure data consistency, exercise HR was recorded using the same HR monitors in all the experimental conditions. A total of 73%, 24%, 18%, 17%, and 30% of the players achieved their HRmax during the YYIE1, YYIE2, YYIR1, TT, and the small-sided football matches, respectively. The probability of achieving HRmax increased proportionally to test duration, with 7.8 minutes as the cutoff time. Variations in HRpeak of ±2 b min-1 should be regarded as of practical relevance. YYIE1 HRpeak provided the most accurate estimation of a subject's individual HRmax and much higher probability of reaching HRmax . Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest caution in considering a reference test for HRmax assessment in this population. The use of confirmation tests is still highly advisable when the test duration is shorter than 7.8 minutes. In this regard, field tests seem to be suitable and accurate for individual HRmax assessment in recreational football players."

In recent years, fitness activity became the most common way to motivate and engage people in sports activity. Recently, there have been multiple attempts to elaborate on the “ideal” IoT-based solution to track and assess these fitness activities. Most fitness activities (except aerobic activities like running) involve one or multiple interactions between the athlete’s hand palms and body or between the hand palms and the workout materials. In this work, we present our idea to exploit these biomechanical interactions of the hand palms to track fitness activities via a smart glove. Our smart glove-based system integrates force-sensitive resistor (FSR) sensors into wearable fitness gloves to identify and count fitness activity, by analyzing the time series of the pressure distribution in the hand palms observed during fitness sessions. To assess the performance of our proposed system, we conducted an experimental study with 10 participants over 10 common fitness activities.

Aim: To describe research related to group physical activity and sport participation of children and adolescent wheelchair users. Methods: The five-step framework described by Arksey and O’Malley was used to guide the review. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and SCOPUS) were searched for relevant literature and selected articles were screened and evaluated for inclusion. Basic article information, study objectives, participant information, methods, outcome measures (quantitative), and themes (qualitative) were extracted from the selected articles. Outcome measures were coded using the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Results: Seventeen articles were included in the review. The quantitative research articles evaluated outcomes related to test/training parameters (n = 2), evaluation of tools/models (n = 6), and biomechanical/physiological/participation profiles of athletes/equipment (n = 5). Four qualitative studies explored perceptions and experiences with participation, social supports, and identity development. No articles focused on power wheelchair sport. Conclusion: Additional research on evaluating outcomes associated with group physical activity and sport participation is needed to inform clinical practice and guide future research."
https://openalex.org/W2956012306,Correcting for individual quality reveals trade-offs in performance among multiple modes of limbless locomotion in snakes,2019-05-20,2019,article,"Abstract Trade-offs among performance traits are often difficult to detect despite the physiological and morphological incompatibilities that underlie disparate traits being well understood. However, recent studies that have corrected for individual quality have found trade-offs in human athletes performing various performance tasks. Few studies have found trade-offs among multiple performance tasks after correcting for individual quality in non-human animals because of the difficulty in motivating many animals to perform biomechanically different tasks. We examined potential trade-offs in maximal speeds among ten locomotor conditions that involved the utilization of different locomotor modes in cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus). Snakes were assessed during terrestrial lateral undulation, swimming, concertina movements (small and large width) and six conditions of arboreal locomotion (combinations of three perch diameters and two inclines). We found no trade-offs among locomotor conditions when analysing uncorrected speeds or speeds corrected for body condition. However, we found several trade-offs among modes and treatments for speeds corrected for individual quality. Terrestrial lateral undulation speeds were negatively related to speeds of concertina and two of the arboreal locomotion conditions. A trade-off between speeds on large and small perch diameters on a 30° incline was also detected and probably reflects potential conflicts in traits that maximize lateral undulation and concertina."

Although age and gout were associated with all 3 KOA outcomes, BMI, nodal osteoarthritis (OA), a family history of OA, knee malalignment, and 2D:4D ratio were associated with one or another of these 3 KOA outcomes.This study is the first to examine KOA risk factors in retired professional footballers. The study has identified several risk factors, both specific (eg, knee injury and training dose) and nonspecific (eg, age and gout) to footballers. This may be used to develop prevention strategies to reduce the risk of KOA in professional footballers after retirement."

Purpose To examine whether the Triad increases the risk of stress fractures, athletes were assigned to a “teenage” group and a “20s” group. Methods This prospective study enrolled 390 elite female athletes and was conducted from 2012 to 2016 at Japan Institute of Sports Sciences. Blood concentrations of various hormones were examined, and BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and throughout the whole body using dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry. LEA was defined as body weight ≤85% of the ideal body weight for teenage athletes, or BMI ≤17.5 for athletes in their 20s. Low BMD was defined as a BMD Z ‐score of &lt;−1.0 in the lumbar spine and the whole body. Results Among 390 athletes enrolled, 36 developed new stress fractures within 3 months of registration. The risk for stress fractures due to the Triad in teenage athletes was higher than for athletes in their 20s. In teenage female athletes, secondary amenorrhea, low BMD for the whole body, and a low ratio of actual body weight to ideal body weight increased the risk for stress fractures by 12.9 times, 4.5 times, and 1.1 times, respectively. Conclusion To prevent stress fractures in female athletes with the Triad, age of athletes should be taken into consideration."

Studies investigating the association between LOC and recovery time or neurophysiological performance have reported ambiguous findings and resulted in a limited understanding of the severity of LOC-inducing head impacts. Concussive injuries with and without LOC from helmet-to-helmet and shoulder collisions and falls in elite American football were reconstructed in laboratory using a hybrid III headform and finite element model to obtain peak linear and rotational acceleration and brain tissue deformation metrics in the cerebral cortex, the cerebral white matter, the corpus callosum, the thalamus and the brainstem. Impact velocity, peak linear and rotational acceleration were significantly greater in the LOC group than the no LOC group. The brain tissue deformation metrics were greater in the LOC group than the no LOC group. The best overall predictor for LOC was impact velocity. Concussions with LOC are characterised by greater magnitudes of brain tissue deformation. This was mainly the result of higher impact velocities in the LOC group providing league decision-makers with an understanding of the importance of managing impact velocity through athlete education and rule enforcement or change."
https://openalex.org/W2945438825,Goals and targets: a developmental puzzle about sensitivity to others’ actions,2019-05-17,2019,article,"Abstract Sensitivity to others’ actions is essential for social animals like humans and a fundamental requirement for any kind of social cognition. Unsurprisingly, it is present in humans from early in the first year of life. But what processes underpin infants’ sensitivity to others’ actions? Any attempt to answer this question must solve twin puzzles about the development of goal tracking. Why does some, but not all, of infants’ goal tracking appear to be limited by their abilities to represent the observed action motorically at the time it occurs? And why does their sensitivity to action sometimes manifest itself differently in dishabituation, pupil dilation and anticipatory looking? Solving these twin puzzles is critical for understanding humans’ earliest sensitivity to others’ actions. After introducing the puzzles, this paper argues that solving them may require identifying multiple, distinct processes for tracking the targets and goals of actions."

Mental health cannot be separated from physical health, as evidenced by mental health symptoms and disorders increasing the risk of physical injury and delaying subsequent recovery. There are no evidence or consensus based guidelines for diagnosis and management of mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. Diagnosis must differentiate character traits particular to elite athletes from psychosocial maladaptations.Management strategies should address all contributors to mental health symptoms and consider biopsychosocial factors relevant to athletes to maximise benefit and minimise harm. Management must involve both treatment of affected individual athletes and optimising environments in which all elite athletes train and compete. To advance a more standardised, evidence based approach to mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes, an International Olympic Committee Consensus Work Group critically evaluated the current state of science and provided recommendations."

When substance use shifts from occasional to regular, heavy or hazardous use, positive and negative effects can develop that vary by substance class and athlete. Regular use of recreational or performance enhancing substances can lead to misuse, sanctions or use disorders.To review the prevalence, patterns of use, risk factors, performance effects and types of intervention for all classes of recreational and performance enhancing substances in elite athletes by sport, ethnicity, country and gender.A comprehensive search was conducted to identify studies that compared the prevalence and patterns of substance use, misuse and use disorders in elite athletes with those of non-athletes and provided detailed demographic and sport variations in reasons for use, risk factors and performance effects for each main substance class.Alcohol, cannabis, tobacco (nicotine) and prescribed opioids and stimulants are the most commonly used substances in elite athletes, but generally used at lower rates than in non-athletes. In contrast, use/misuse rates for binge alcohol, oral tobacco, non-prescription opioids and anabolic-androgenic steroids are higher among athletes than non-athletes, especially in power and collision sports. Cannabis/cannabinoids seem to have replaced nicotine as the second most commonly used substance.Substance use in elite athletes varies by country, ethnicity, gender, sport and competitive level. There are no studies on substance use disorder prevalence in elite male and female athletes and few studies with direct comparison groups."

Small graft diameter is one risk factor for graft failure and options to upsize the autologous hamstring graft include allograft augmentation and tripling one or both of the hamstring tendons. Purpose: To evaluate the association of upsized hamstring graft constructs and graft rupture after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients 19 years of age and younger who underwent hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction with or without soft tissue allograft augmentation from 2012 to 2016. All patients were skeletally mature or had less than 2 years of growth remaining. Graft constructs included 4-strand doubled semitendinosus and gracilis autograft (4-STG), 5-strand tripled semitendinosus and doubled gracilis autograft (5-STG), and 6-strand doubled gracilis and semitendinosus autograft augmented with a soft tissue allograft (6-STGAllo). The primary outcome measure was graft rupture. Results: A total of 354 patients with a mean age of 15.3 years (range, 10-19 years) were included. Graft constructs included 4-STG (198 knees), 5-STG (91 knees), and 6-STGAllo (65 knees). The average diameter of the graft constructs was 8.3 mm for 4-STG, 8.9 mm for 5-STG, and 9.2 mm for 6-STGAllo ( P &lt; .001). The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 6-56 months). There were 50 (14%) graft ruptures and 24 (7%) contralateral ACL tears. The graft failure rates were 14% for 4-STG, 12% for 5-STG, and 20% for 6-STGAllo ( P = .51). The average time to graft failure was 16 months (range, 2-40 months). After adjusting for age and graft size, patients who had allograft-augmented grafts (6-STGAllo) had 2.6 (95% CI, 1.02, 6.50) times the odds of graft rupture compared with 4-STG. There was no significant difference in failure rate between patients who had 5-STG grafts compared with 4-STG (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5, 2.7). Conclusion: ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts augmented with allografts has a significantly increased risk of graft rupture compared with comparably sized hamstring tendon autografts. In situations where the surgeon harvests an inadequately sized 4-strand autograft, we recommend obtaining a larger graft diameter by tripling the semitendinosus rather than augmenting with an allograft."

Before and after the intervention, tests for the assessment of proxies of muscle power (ie, countermovement jump, standing long jump); speed (ie, 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprint); CoD (ie, Illinois CoD test, modified 505 agility test); and kicking-distance were conducted. Data were analyzed using magnitude-based inferences.Within-group analyses for the LPJT group showed large and very large improvements for 10-m sprint time (effect size [ES] = 2.00) and modified 505 CoD (ES = 2.83) tests, respectively. For the same group, moderate improvements were observed for the Illinois CoD test (ES = 0.61), 5- and 20-m sprint time test (ES = 1.00 for both the tests), countermovement jump test (ES = 1.00), and the maximal kicking-distance test (ES = 0.90). Small enhancements in the standing long jump test (ES = 0.50) were apparent. Regarding the UPJT group, small improvements were observed for all tests (ES = 0.33-0.57), except 5- and 10-m sprint time (ES = 1.00 and 0.63, respectively). Between-group analyses favored the LPJT group for the modified 505 CoD (ES = 0.61), standing long jump (ES = 0.50), and maximal kicking-distance tests (ES = 0.57), but not for the 5-m sprint time test (ES = 1.00). Only trivial between-group differences were shown for the remaining tests (ES = 0.00-0.09).Overall, LPJT appears to be more effective than UPJT in improving measures of muscle power, speed, CoD, and kicking-distance performance in prepubertal male soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W2945285798,Effects of Plyometric Versus Optimum Power Load Training on Components of Physical Fitness in Young Male Soccer Players,2019-05-16,2019,article,"Purpose : The current study aimed to compare the effects of plyometric (PT) versus optimum power load (OPL) training on physical performance of young high-level soccer players. Methods : Athletes were randomly divided into PT (horizontal and vertical drills) and OPL (squat + hip thrust exercises at the load of maximum power output) interventions, applied over 7 weeks during the in-season period. Squat and countermovement jumps, maximal sprint (10 and 30 m), and change of direction (COD; agility t test) were the pretraining and posttraining measured performance variables. Magnitude-based inference was used for within- and between-group comparisons. Results : OPL training induced moderate improvements in vertical squat jump (effect size [ES]: 0.97; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.32–1.61) and countermovement jump (ES: 1.02; 90% CI, 0.46–1.57), 30-m sprint speed (ES: 1.02; 90% CI, 0.09–1.95), and COD performance (ES: 0.93; 90% CI, 0.50–1.36). After PT training method, vertical squat jump (ES: 1.08; 90% CI, 0.66–1.51) and countermovement jump (ES: 0.62; 90% CI, 0.18–1.06) were moderately increased, while small enhancements were noticed for 30-m sprint speed (ES: 0.21; 90% CI, −0.02 to 0.45) and COD performance (ES: 0.53; 90% CI, 0.24–0.81). The 10-m sprint speed possibly increased after PT intervention (small ES: 0.25; 90% CI, −0.05 to 0.54), but no substantial change (small ES: 0.36; 90% CI, −0.40 to 1.13) was noticed in OPL. For between-group analyses, the COD ability and 30-m sprint performances were possibly (small ES: 0.30; 90% CI, −0.20 to 0.81; Δ = +1.88%) and likely (moderate ES: 0.81; 90% CI, −0.16 to 1.78; Δ = +2.38%) more improved in the OPL than in the PT intervention, respectively. Conclusions : The 2 different training programs improved physical performance outcomes during the in-season period. However, the combination of vertically and horizontally based training exercises (squat + hip thrust) at optimum power zone led to superior gains in COD and 30-m linear sprint performances."

However, effect of graft type including bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB), hamstring tendon, or iliotibial band (ITB) on thigh size, knee range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength are understudied. Objective : To compare postoperative thigh circumference, knee ROM, and hip and thigh muscle strength in adolescent males who underwent ACLR, based on the 3 different autograft types: BTB, hamstring (HS), and ITB. Setting : Biomechanical laboratory. Participants : Male ACLR patients who are younger than 22 years of age (total N = 164). Intervention : At 6- to 9-month postoperative visits, thigh circumference, knee ROM, and hip and thigh muscle strength were measured. Main Outcome Measures : Deficits of each variable between the uninvolved and ACLR limb were compared for pediatric and adolescent ACLR males in the BTB, HS, and ITB cohorts. Baseline characteristics, including physical demographics and meniscus tear status, were compared, and differences identified were treated as covariates and incorporated in analysis of covariance. Results : Data were from 164 adolescent male ACLR patients [mean age 15.7 (1.2) years]. There were no statistical differences in thigh circumference, knee ROM, hip abductor, and hip-extensor strength among the 3 autografts. However, patients with BTB demonstrated 12.2% deficits in quadriceps strength compared with 0.5% surplus in HS patients ( P = .002) and 1.2% deficits in ITB patients ( P = .03). Patients with HS showed 31.7% deficits in hamstring strength compared with 5.4% deficits in BTB ( P = .001) and 7.7% deficits in ITB ( P = .001) groups at 6- to 9-month postoperative visits. Conclusion : Adolescent male ACLR patients with BTB and HS autografts demonstrated significant deficits in quadriceps and hamstring strength, respectively, at 6 to 9 months postoperatively. Minimal lower-extremity strength deficits were demonstrated in pediatric male ACLR patients undergoing ITB harvest."
https://openalex.org/W2945389927,Effect of Fatigue on Functional Stability of the Knee: Particularities of Female Handball Players,2019-05-16,2019,article,"The risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury in female handball players is high. Fatigue of active stabilizers and increases in joint laxity are often mentioned in the literature as causal factors. However, no studies have been carried out on this population. Our objective is to determine the effect of muscle fatigue on active and passive knee stability in female handball players. This prospective study assessed tibiofemoral joint laxity, as well as hamstring and quadriceps strength, before (Tinitial), during and 3 min after (Tfinal) an isokinetic fatigue protocol (25 repetitions of knee flexion / extension at 180°.s-1). Laxity values (slope of the displacement-load curve and anterior tibial translation) were measured using a GNRB-Rotab® arthrometer; torque values were measured at specific joint angles and peak muscle torque using an isokinetic dynamometer. Nineteen women (20.9±2.4 years, 62.0±4.9 kg, 166±5 cm) were included. Normalized peak torque decreased significantly between the first three and last three repetitions of the fatigue protocol (p<0.0001, ES=3.2 and 3.2). Slope of the displacement-load curve and anterior tibial translation, functional and conventional ratios did not change significantly between Tinitial and Tfinal. Active and passive markers of knee stability were not altered by a fatigue protocol in female handball players, suggesting these players have a large capacity for recovery. These results suggest that muscle strengthening to prevent ACL injury in female handball players may be inappropriate.Level of evidence: Level 2b, Prospective Cohort."

Secondary measurements were short form-36 and Beck Depression Inventory.Higher Lysholm (P = .001) and Beck Depression Inventory (P = .03) scores were observed in the elite athlete group, and higher pain (P = .001) was observed in the nonathlete group at baseline assessments. Significant improvement detected for pain (P < .05), knee flexion range (P < .05), Lysholm score (P < .05), and Beck Depression Inventory (P < .05) compared with preintervention for both groups. Finally, after comparing the mean change values, the nonathlete group displayed greater decrease in pain level (P = .01) and participants in the elite athlete group further showed a greater decrease in depression level (P = .001).This study found that the same accelerated rehabilitation protocol provides significant improvements for pain, functionality, and depression in both elite athletes and nonathletes after ACLR.

There are over 250,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries per year in the United States. There are over 175,000 ACL reconstructions annually. This study was a double-blinded design to establish the reliability and validity of a new orthopedic device to measure linear translation of the tibia on the femur (ACL testing). Methods : A Zeiss Smartzoom microscope was used as the gold standard to assess the ability of the Mobil-Aider ™ to measure linear translation. Sixty blinded measures were taken with each of 6 different devices. Results : Both the intraclass correlation and the Pearson correlation were .986. The Cronbach alpha reliability analysis was 0.992. Independent 1-sample t tests were performed on the differences between the Mobil-Aider ™ and Zeiss values, and were not found to be significant ( P = .42); that is, they were the same. Bland–Altman plot and a linear regression revealed no propositional bias. Finally, with 360 measures over 6 devices, the power of this study was calculated to be 100%. Discussion : This data are the first step in establishing reliability and concurrent validity of a new device. As a result of the current data, the Mobil-Aider ™ device is deemed a promising orthopedic tool for use in assessing the laxity of the ACL. Additional testing needs to be performed on both healthy and injured knees. Conclusions : There is potential for the Mobil-Aider ™ to contribute to the assessment of ACL injuries, but additional human testing is needed."

Acetabular Chondrolabral Debridement/Abrasion Demonstrates Similar Outcomes and Survival to Microfracture in Hip Arthroscopy: A Multicenter Analysis,2019-05-15,2019,article,"Background: Hip arthroscopy is becoming more advanced and commonly performed. However, significant controversy exists regarding whether high-grade acetabular cartilage lesions should be treated with debridement/abrasion or microfracture. In addition, patients treated with microfracture are subject to extended protected weightbearing rehabilitation to mitigate risk of subchondral plate fracture and to protect fibrocartilage tissue formation. Purpose: To determine the midterm patient-reported outcomes and failure rate of patients with grade 3 and 4 acetabular labrum articular disruption (ALAD) lesions managed with debridement/abrasion or microfracture. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Primary arthroscopic labral repair cases at 2 centers from November 2008 to April 2016 were reviewed for patients aged &lt;55 years with unipolar ALAD grade 3 and 4 chondrolabral acetabular delamination. Patients undergoing microfracture and debridement/abrasion were compared using the visual analog pain scale (VAS), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and Hip Outcome Score–Sports-Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS) to determine predictors of outcomes and failure. Results: A total of 113 hips in 110 patients (66 males, 44 females; mean age, 34.5 ± 1.1 years) undergoing debridement/abrasion (n = 82) or microfracture (n = 31) were followed for a mean of 4.9 years (range, 2.0-8.5 years). Lesion size was not statistically different between the debridement/abrasion (1.3 ± 1.0 cm 2 ) and microfracture cohorts (1.4 ± 1.0 cm 2 ) ( P = .47). Patients undergoing debridement/abrasion achieved 3.6-point mean improvements in VAS ( P &lt; .01), 21.2-point improvements in mHHS ( P &lt; .01), and 25.4-point improvements in HOS-SSS ( P &lt; .01), which were not significantly different from those observed in microfracture patients ( P≥ .20). The 5-year rate of survival free of revision surgery was 84.0% in the debridement/abrasion group and 85.6% in the microfracture group ( P = .78). The cartilage treatment technique was found not to be predictive of revision risk during both univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; P = .98) and multivariate (HR, 0.93; P = .90) analysis accounting for patient age, lesion grade, and acetabular coverage. Conclusion: Patients undergoing debridement/abrasion of high-grade unipolar acetabular cartilage lesions demonstrate similar outcome scores and revision rates compared with those of patients undergoing microfracture. These outcomes support the consideration of preferential debridement/abrasion at the discretion of the treating surgeon to optimize recovery while maintaining established positive outcomes after hip arthroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2946149201,Disrupted White Matter Microstructure of the Cerebellar Peduncles in Scholastic Athletes After Concussion,2019-05-15,2019,article,"Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a major public health concern, linked with persistent post-concussive syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. At present, standard clinical imaging fails to reliably detect traumatic axonal injury associated with concussion and post-concussive symptoms. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR imaging technique that is sensitive to changes in white matter microstructure. Prior studies using DTI did not jointly investigate white matter microstructure in athletes, a population at high risk for concussive and subconcussive head traumas, with those in typical emergency room (ER) patients. In this study, we determine DTI scalar metrics in both ER patients and scholastic athletes who suffered concussions and compared them to those in age-matched healthy controls. In the early subacute post-concussion period, athletes demonstrated an elevated rate of regional decreases in axial diffusivity (AD) compared to controls. These regional decreases of AD were especially pronounced in the cerebellar peduncles, and were more frequent in athletes compared to the ER patient sample. The group differences may indicate differences in the mechanisms of the concussive impacts as well as possible compound effects of cumulative subconcussive impacts in athletes. The prevalence of white matter abnormality in cerebellar tracts lends credence to the hypothesis that post-concussive symptoms are caused by shearing of axons within an attention network mediated by the cerebellum, and warrant further study of the correlation between cerebellar DTI findings and clinical, neurocognitive, oculomotor and vestibular outcomes in mTBI patients."
https://openalex.org/W2944915381,Left Ventricular Systolic Function Assessed by Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Athletes with and without Left Ventricle Hypertrophy,2019-05-15,2019,article,"The aim of this study was to evaluate selected parameters of strain and rotation of the left ventricle (the basal rotation (BR) index, the basal circumferential strain (BCS) index, and the global longitudinal strain (GLS) of the left ventricle) in male athletes with physiological cardiac hypertrophy (LVH group), and athletes (non-LVH group) and non-athletes without hypertrophy (control group, CG). They were evaluated using transthoracic echocardiography and speckle tracking echocardiography before and after an incremental exercise test. The LVH group demonstrated lower BR at rest than the non-LVH group (p < 0.05) and the CG (p < 0.05). Physical effort had no effect on BR, nor was this effect different between groups (p > 0.05). There was a combined influence of LVH and physical effort on BR (F = 5.70; p < 0.05) and BCS (F = 4.97; p < 0.05), but no significant differences in BCS and GLS at rest between the groups. A higher BCS and lower GLS after exercise in the LVH group were demonstrated in comparison with the CG (p < 0.05). Left ventricular basal rotation as well as longitudinal and circumferential strains showed less of a difference between rest and after physical effort in subjects with significant myocardial hypertrophy. In conclusion, the obtained results may suggest that echocardiographic assessment of basal rotation and circumferential strain of the left ventricular can be important in predicting cardiac disorders caused by physical effort in individuals with physiological and pathological heart hypertrophy."

For older adults, qualitative variables with the physical activity context may influence cognition than quantitative variables (e.g., intensity, duration). The purpose of this study was two-fold. The first objective was to develop taxonomies for two qualitative components within the physical activity environment: the level of task complexity (both motoric and cognitive) and the degree to which social engagement occurs during physical activity engagement. The second objective was to assess the relationships among these two components and the cognitive function of active, older adults. Physical activities reported by the participants (N = 75) were evaluated separately for the level of task complexity and social engagement. Three components of executive function were measured as indicators of cognitive function and included inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Results from multiple regressions revealed that higher levels of social engagement or more complex physical activity among this sample of older adults did not contribute to variability in any of the three indices of executive function. However, the taxonomies developed to directly assess the variability in social engagement and task complexity for a variety of physical activities developed in this research serves as a meaningful contribution to the literature and can be utilized for intervention design among physical activity interventions across a lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2944872864,Maximum acceleration performance of professional soccer players in linear sprints: Is there a direct connection with change-of-direction ability?,2019-05-14,2019,article,"The purpose of this study was to examine the selective influences of the maximum acceleration capability on change of direction (COD) speed, COD deficit, linear sprint speed, sprint momentum, and loaded and unloaded vertical jump performances in forty-nine male professional soccer players (24.3 ± 4.2 years; 75.4 ± 5.4 kg; 177.9 ± 6.4 cm). Soccer players performed the assessments in the following order: 1) squat and countermovement jumps; 2) 20-m sprinting speed test; 3) Zigzag COD ability test; and 4) bar-power outputs in the jump squat exercise. Athletes were divided, using a median split analysis, into two different groups according to their maximum acceleration rates from zero to 5-m (e.g., higher and lower ACC 0-5-m). Magnitude-based inference was used to compare the differences in the physical test results between ""higher"" and ""lower"" acceleration groups. A selective influence of the maximum acceleration ability on speed-power tests was observed, as the higher acceleration group demonstrated likely to almost certain higher performances than the lower acceleration group in all measurements (effect sizes varying from 0.66 [for sprint momentum in 20-m] to 2.39 [for sprint velocity in 5-m]). Conversely, the higher acceleration group demonstrated a higher COD deficit when compared to the lower acceleration group (ES = 0.55). This indicates compromised efficiency to perform COD maneuvers in this group of players. In summary, it was observed that soccer players with higher maximum acceleration rates are equally able to jump higher, sprint faster (over short distances), and achieve higher COD velocities than their slower counterparts. However, they appear to be less efficient at changing direction, which may be related to their reduced ability to deal with greater entry and exit velocities, or counterbalance the associated mechanical consequences (i.e., greater inertia) of being faster and more powerful."
https://openalex.org/W2945734689,Irisin and Bone: From Preclinical Studies to the Evaluation of Its Circulating Levels in Different Populations of Human Subjects,2019-05-14,2019,review,"Almost four years after the discovery of the anabolic action of irisin on bone in mice, ample clinical evidence is emerging in support of its additional physiological relevance in human bone. Irisin inversely correlates with sclerostin levels in adults with prediabetes and with vertebral fragility fractures in post-menopausal women. Furthermore, in athletes we observed a positive correlation between irisin and bone mineral density at different anatomical sites. Our group also described a positive association between serum irisin and bone status in healthy children and multivariate regression analysis showed that irisin is a stronger determinant of bone mineral status than bone alkaline phosphatase. In children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, serum irisin concentrations are positively associated with bone quality and with glycemic control following continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Additionally, our in vitro studies suggest the existence of a negative interplay between PTH and irisin biology and these results were also supported by the observation that post-menopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism have lower levels of irisin compared to matched controls. In this review, we will focus on recent findings about circulating level of irisin in different populations of human subjects and its correlation with their bone status."

Reports regarding treatment and postoperative outcomes are more limited than its anterior and superior counterparts.To evaluate the clinical presentation, surgical findings, postoperative outcomes, and rate of return to sport after arthroscopic repair of posterior labral injuries of the shoulder among baseball players.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Retrospective review was performed of baseball players who underwent arthroscopic posterior labral repair between 2009 and 2015 by a single surgeon, with a minimum 2-year follow-up. The group was composed of 32 male patients involved in recreational (6.3%), high school (43.8%), college (31.3%), and professional (18.8%) baseball, with a mean age of 20.5 years. Patients were categorized by chief complaint, clinical findings, surgical findings, and concomitant procedures performed. Pre- and postoperative measures included pain scale, range of motion, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, return to play, and patient satisfaction.A variety of tear patterns were identified; 32% involved 90° of the posterior superior labrum; 35% involved the posterior 180°; and 32% involved 90° of the posterior inferior labrum. The dominant mechanism of injury was throwing (34.4%). The most common chief complaint was pain (n = 25, 78%), followed by pain and instability symptoms (n = 6, 18.8%), with only 3% citing isolated sensation of instability. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly identified tear patterns in 75% of cases. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores significantly improved ( P < .0001), increasing on average 30.9 points from the preoperative mean of 65.4 to a postoperative mean of 96.3. No significant range of motion deficits were noted. Tear size and number of anchors utilized did not influence outcomes. Ninety-four percent of athletes returned to play, 61% at previous levels, and 6% did not return. Pitchers had a lower return to previous level of play than position players (41% vs 86%, P = .0113).Arthroscopic treatment of posterior labral tears of baseball players was effective in improving pain and function, resulting in 94% patient satisfaction and 94% return to sport, with 61% returning to previous level of play. Patient presentation is variable, with a majority of patients citing pain rather than instability."

A cluster, randomised controlled trial of adolescent athletes",2019-05-14,2019,article,"Background There have been no large randomised controlled trials to determine whether soccer headgear reduces the incidence or severity of sport-related concussion (SRC) in US high school athletes. Objective We aimed to determine whether headgear reduces the incidence or severity (days out from soccer) of SRCs in soccer players. Methods 2766 participants (67% female, age 15.6±1.2) (who undertook 3050 participant years) participated in this cluster randomised trial. Athletes in the headgear (HG) group wore headgear during the season, while those in the no headgear (NoHG) group did not. Staff recorded SRC and non-SRC injuries and soccer exposures. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine time-to-SRC between groups, while severity was compared with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results 130 participants (5.3% female, 2.2% male) sustained an SRC. The incidence of SRC was not different between the HG and NoHG groups for males (HR: 2.00 (0.63–6.43) p=0.242) and females (HR: 0.86 (0.54–1.36) p=0.520). Days lost from SRC were not different (p=0.583) between the HG group (13.5 (11.0–018.8) days) and the NoHG group (13.0 (9.0–18.8) days). Conclusions Soccer headgear did not reduce the incidence or severity of SRC in high school soccer players. Trial registration number NCT02850926 ."

The International Journal of Sport Science and Coaching 10 (4): 655–668] argued that because no two students learn or conceive knowledge in exactly the same way, teaching contexts require a flexible approach to instruction, based on a methodological continuum of empirical to radical constructivism. In short, providing novice learners with sufficient opportunities to learn requires flexibility and a holistic experiential approach to teaching that is appropriate for the learner, activity and context.Purpose: This paper examines an evolving understanding of TGfU and Game-Centred Learning (GCL). The medium for articulating this is through the presentation of a proposed model of GCL. At the heart of this model is the notion of play, invented games and its attendant qualities of creativity, fun, affiliation and exploration. The process of arriving at this model of GCL has involved an evaluation of various models of GCL, and exploring associated questions related to teaching games, especially for the generalist teacher.Discussion: This proposed model also reflects a discussion of arguments along ideological continuums of instruction in games; for example, should fundamental movement skills (FMS) be taught before game instruction or should game pedagogy be solely based on GCL? In this paper, these positions are brought together through reference to Fundamental Game Skills [Smith, W. ""Fundamental Movement Skills and Fundamental Games Skills Are Complementary Pairs and Should be Taught in Complementary Ways at all Stages of Skill Development."" Sport, Education and Society 21 (3): 431–442], the application of complexity theory [Ovens, A., T. Hopper, and J. Butler. 2013. Complexity Thinking in Physical Education: Reframing Curriculum, Pedagogy and Research. Oxon: Routledge], and complementary learning in skill acquisition [Kelso, J. A. S., and D. A. Engstrom. 2006. The Complementary Nature. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press]. Smith's practitioner position provides further justification for a GCL model from a skill acquisition perspective.Conclusion: The proposed model of GCL focuses on flexibility and pragmatism, with the intent of making a GCL approach accessible to those who teach games to novices or to more experienced athletes."

Çalışmaya 34 kadın voleybolcu gönüllü olarak katılmıştır. Voleybolcuların el bileği (60°s -1 ve 90°s -1 ) ve omuz kuvvetleri (60°s -1 ve 180°s -1 ) izokinetik dinamometre ile, servis atış ve smaç vuruş hızları radar aleti ile belirlenmiştir. Voleybolcuların izokinetik el bileği ve omuz kuvveti ile servis ve smaç hızı arasındaki ilişkiyi belirlemek için Pearson Korelasyon Analizi kullanılmıştır. Yapılan istatiksel analiz sonucunda, kadın voleybolcuların el bilek ve omuz izokinetik kuvveti ile servis ve smaç hızları arasında anlamlı bir ilişki belirlenmezken, (p>0,05) el bileği ile omuz izokinetik kuvvetleri arasında pozitif yönde anlamlı bir ilişki tespit edilmiştir (p<0,05). Bu sonuçlarla voleybolcuların servis ve smaç hızlarının üst ekstremite kuvvetleri ile ilişkili olduğu bilinmesine rağmen, yalnızca el bileği ya da yalnızca omuz kuvvetinin servis atış ve smaç vuruş hızını arttırmadığı, tüm üst ekstremite ve hatta gövde kaslarının da etkisiyle gerçekleştiği söylenebilir. Bu durum göz önüne alınarak, voleybolcuların servis atış ve smaç vuruş hızlarını geliştirebilmek için el bileği ve omuz kuvvetine ilaveten diğer değişkenleri de (tüm üst ekstremite ve gövde kaslarının da kuvvetlendirilmesi, vuruş tekniğinin geliştirilmesi vb.) geliştirmeleri gerektiği düşünülmektedir."
https://openalex.org/W2944152421,Evaluation of head impact exposure measured from youth football game plays,2019-05-10,2019,article,"OBJECTIVE There is a growing body of literature informing efforts to improve the safety of football; however, research relating on-field activity to head impacts in youth football is limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare head impact exposure (HIE) measured in game plays among 3 youth football teams. METHODS Head impact and video data were collected from athletes (ages 10–13 years) participating on 3 youth football teams. Video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each to a specific play type. Each play was categorized as a down, punt, kickoff, field goal, or false start. Kickoffs and punts were classified as special teams. Downs were classified as running, passing, or other. HIE was quantified by play type in terms of mean, median, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration. Mixed-effects models were used to assess differences in acceleration among play types. Contact occurring on special teams plays was evaluated using a standardized video abstraction form. RESULTS A total of 3003 head impacts over 27.5 games were analyzed and paired with detailed video coding of plays. Most head impacts were attributed to running (79.6%), followed by passing (14.0%), and special teams (6.4%) plays. The 95th percentile linear acceleration measured during each play type was 52.6 g , 50.7 g , and 65.5 g , respectively. Special teams had significantly greater mean linear acceleration than running and passing plays (both p = 0.03). The most common kick result on special teams was a deep kick, of which 85% were attempted to be returned. No special teams plays resulted in a touchback, and one resulted in a fair catch. One-third of all special teams plays and 92% of all nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate a trend toward higher head impact magnitudes on special teams than for running and passing plays, but a greater number of impacts were measured during running plays. Deep kicks were most common on special teams, and many returned and nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. These results support policy changes to youth special teams plays, including modifying the yard line the ball is kicked from and coaching proper return technique. Further investigation into biomechanical exposure measured during game impact scenarios is needed to inform policy relevant to the youth level."
https://openalex.org/W2944234372,"Injury Incidence in Youth, High School, and NCAA Men’s Lacrosse",2019-05-10,2019,article,"BACKGROUND: We compared injury incidence and mechanisms among youth, high school (HS), and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) boys’ and men’s lacrosse athletes for the 2014–2015 to 2016–2017 lacrosse seasons. METHODS: Multiple injury surveillance systems were used to capture 21 youth boys’, 22 HS boys’, and 20 NCAA men’s lacrosse team-seasons of data during the 2014–2015 to 2016–2017 seasons. Athletic trainers reported game and practice injuries and athlete exposures (AEs). Injuries included those occurring during a game and/or practice and requiring evaluation from an athletic trainer and/or physician. Injury counts, rates per 1000 AEs, and injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: The injury rate in youth was higher than those reported in HS (10.3 vs 5.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6–2.4) and the NCAA (10.3 vs 4.7 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9–2.5). When considering time loss injuries only (restricted participation of ≥24 hours), the injury rate in youth was lower than those reported in HS (2.0 vs 2.9 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5–0.95) and the NCAA (2.0 vs 3.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.8). The concussion rate in youth was higher than those in HS (0.7 vs 0.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1–5.2) and the NCAA (0.7 vs 0.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2–3.7). Injuries at the youth, HS, and NCAA levels were most commonly associated with stick contact, inflammatory conditions (including bursitis, tendonitis, and other unspecified inflammation), and noncontact mechanisms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the time loss injury rate was lowest in youth boys’ lacrosse, the concussion rate was the highest. Injury prevention approaches should be specific to the mechanisms associated with each level of play (eg, equipment skill development in youth)."

Forty football players participated in this study. Ankle dorsiflexion ROM was recorded to examine acute (pre-match, immediately post-match and 48 h post-match) and chronic (pre-season, mid-season and post-season) effects of competitive football. In addition, it was found that players had restricted mobility measures on ankle dorsiflexion as >2 cm change between baseline measures (pre-match and pre-season). The training load of all played matches was estimated using a global positioning system (GPS) and RPE. Pre-season ankle dorsiflexion ROM was greater compared to mid-season (8.1% in the dominant, and 9.6% in the non-dominant leg) and post-season (13.8% in the dominant, and 12.5% in the non-dominant leg). In addition, around 30% of all players showed restricted ankle dorsiflexion ROM values in post-season compared with pre-season. Related to acute effects, ankle dorsiflexion ROM increased after a match (5.8%) in the dominant ankle, and this value decreased (2.65%) 48 h post-match when post-match measurements in both dominant and non-dominant ankles were compared. The progressive decrease in ankle dorsiflexion ROM throughout a season can be an indicator of increased risk of injury and may be reinforce the need of prevention actions such as stretching exercises and eccentric strength training in professional football players. In addition, these findings suggest to implement specific recovery strategies aiming at minimizing alteration in ankle dorsiflexion ROM 48 h post-match."

Musculoskeletal modelling can help analyse the relationship between motion, external forces and internal loads that lead to injury. However, impact specific musculoskeletal models are lacking as current viscoelastic values used to describe cervical spine joint dynamics have been obtained from unrepresentative quasi-static or static experiments. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a cervical spine musculoskeletal model for use in axial impacts. Cervical spine specimens (C2-C6) were tested under measured sub-catastrophic loads and the resulting 3D motion of the vertebrae was measured. Specimen specific musculoskeletal models were then created and used to estimate the axial and shear viscoelastic (stiffness and damping) properties of the joints through an optimisation algorithm that minimised tracking errors between measured and simulated kinematics. A five-fold cross validation and a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the performance of the newly estimated parameters. The impact-specific parameters were integrated in a population specific musculoskeletal model and used to assess cervical spine loads measured from Rugby union impacts compared to available models. Results of the optimisation showed a larger increase of axial joint stiffness compared to axial damping and shear viscoelastic parameters for all models. The sensitivity analysis revealed that lower values of axial stiffness and shear damping reduced the models performance considerably compared to other degrees of freedom. The impact-specific parameters integrated in the population specific model estimated more appropriate joint displacements for axial head impacts compared to available models and are therefore more suited for injury mechanism analysis."

Methods: A retrospective data analysis of 718 orthopedic presentations among 381 adolescent elite athletes from 16 different sports to a sports medical department was performed. Recorded data of history and clinical examination included area, cause and structure of acute and overuse injuries. Injury-events were analyzed in the whole cohort and stratified by age (11-14/15-17 years) and sex. Group differences were tested by chi-squared-tests. Logistic regression analysis was applied examining the influence of factors age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) on the outcome variables area and structure (α = 0.05). Results: Higher proportions of injury-events were reported for females (60%) and athletes of the older age group (66%) than males and younger athletes. The most frequently injured area was the lower extremity (47%) followed by the spine (30.5%) and the upper extremity (12.5%). Acute injuries were mainly located at the lower extremity (74.5%), while overuse injuries were predominantly observed at the lower extremity (41%) as well as the spine (36.5%). Joints (34%), muscles (22%), and tendons (21.5%) were found to be the most often affected structures. The injured structures were different between the age groups (p = 0.022), with the older age group presenting three times more frequent with ligament pathology events (5.5%/2%) and less frequent with bony problems (11%/20.5%) than athletes of the younger age group. The injured area differed between the sexes (p = 0.005), with males having fewer spine injury-events (25.5%/34%) but more upper extremity injuries (18%/9%) than females. Regression analysis showed statistically significant influence for BMI (p = 0.002) and age (p = 0.015) on structure, whereas the area was significantly influenced by sex (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Events of soft-tissue overuse injuries are the most common reasons resulting in orthopedic presentations of adolescent elite athletes. Mostly, the lower extremity and the spine are affected, while sex and age characteristics on affected area and structure must be considered. Therefore, prevention strategies addressing the injury-event profiles should already be implemented in early adolescence taking age, sex as well as injury entity into account."
https://openalex.org/W2944428601,Influence of Whole-Body Electrostimulation on the Deformability of Density-Separated Red Blood Cells in Soccer Players,2019-05-09,2019,article,"Red blood cell nitric oxide synthase (RBC-NOS) dependent NO production positively affects RBC deformability which is known to improve oxygen supply to the working tissue. Whole-body electrostimulation (WB-EMS) has been shown to improve maximum strength, sprinting and jumping performance, and to increase deformability in elite soccer players during the season. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether WB-EMS affects RBC turnover which might affect overall deformability of circulating RBC by rejuvenation of the RBC population and if this might be related to improved endurance capacity. Thirty male field soccer players were assigned in either a WB-EMS group (EG, n=10), a training group (TG, n=10) or a control group (CG, n=10). EG performed 3 x 10 squat jumps superimposed with WB-EMS twice per week in concurrent to 2-4 soccer training sessions and one match per week. TG only performed 3 x 10 squat jumps without EMS in addition to their soccer routine and the control group only performed the usual soccer training and match per week. Subjects were tested before (Baseline) and in week 7 (wk-7), with blood sampling before (Pre), 15-30min after (Post) and 24h after (24h post) the training. Endurance capacity was determined before and directly after the training period. The key findings of the investigation indicate an increase in young RBC in the EG group along with improved overall RBC deformability, represented by decreased SS1/2:EImax Ratio. Analysis of the different RBC subfractions revealed improved RBC deformability of old RBC during study period. This improvement was not only observed in the EG but also in TG and CG. Changes in RBC deformability were not associated to altered RBC-NOS/NO signalling pathway. Endurance capacity remained unchanged during study period. In summary, the effect of WB-EMS on RBC physiology seems to be rather low and results are only in part comparable to previous findings. According to the lower training volume of the present study it can be speculated that the soccer specific training load in addition to the WB-EMS was too low to induce changes in RBC physiology."

Inability to control back/pelvis, hip and lower limb movements may contribute to the onset and recurrence of symptoms. Our hypothesis is that results from a battery of cognitive movement control tests can inform a cognitive movement control (neuromuscular) retraining programme for improving the clinical presentation and quality of life in an athlete with FAIS. This case report presents a female elite rower with persistent left-sided anterior hip pain, four years post-arthroscopic surgery for FAIS, whose symptoms failed to respond to conventional physical therapy. Hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS), passive and active hip flexion range of motion (ROM) workload (time training on water), hip and pelvic kinematics (3-D motion analysis) and electromyography during a seated hip flexion movement control test, and a movement control test battery to identify movement control impairments (The Foundation Matrix), were assessed pre-intervention (week 0) and immediately post-intervention (week 16). Impaired movement control was targeted in a tailored 16-week cognitive movement control retraining exercise program. All measures improved: HAGOS (all 6 sub-scales); symptoms (61/100 pre-training to 96/100 post-training); physical activities participation (13/100 to 75/100); and active hip flexion ROM increased (78 to 116 and 98 to 118 degrees, respectively); workload increased from 4 to 18 h/week; and movement control impairment reduced (25/50 to 9/50). Pelvic motion on kinematic analysis were altered, and delayed activation onset of tensor fascia latae and rectus femoris muscles reduced. This proof-of-concept case report supports the hypothesis that cognitive movement control tests can inform a targeted cognitive movement control retraining program to improve symptoms, function and quality of life, in an elite rower with persistent hip pain. This training offers an alternative approach to conventional physical therapy, which has failed to restore function in FAIS, and the present study illustrates how specific cognitive movement control assessment can direct individual training programmes."

The importance of neck stiffness and active musculature in the standard linear impactor helmet test was assessed using a detailed head and neck finite element (FE) model from a current human body model (HBM) compared to a validated hybrid III head and neck FE model. The models were assessed for bare-head and helmeted impacts at three speeds (5.5, 7.4, and 9.3 m/s) and three impact orientations. The HBM head and neck was assessed without muscle activation and with a high level of muscle activation representing a braced condition. The HBM and hybrid III had an average cross-correlation rating of 0.89 for acceleration in the primary impact direction, indicating excellent correspondence regardless of muscle activation. Differences were identified in the axial head acceleration, attributed to axial neck stiffness (correlation rating of 0.45), but these differences did not have a large effect on the overall head response using existing head response metrics (head injury criteria, brain injury criteria, and head impact power). Although responses that develop over longer durations following the impact differed slightly, such as the moment at the base of the neck, this occurred later in time, and therefore, did not considerably affect the short-term head kinematics in the primary impact direction. Though muscle activation did not play a strong role in the head response for the test configurations considered, muscle activation may play a role in longer duration events."

While there are some data on their functional performance or restriction of range of motion, there is little knowledge on the quantifiable passive mechanical effectiveness of various devices. This study aimed to determine the prophylactic stabilization effect for commonly prescribed ankle orthoses in a simulated recurrent ankle sprain. Eleven anatomic lower leg specimens were tested in plantar flexion and hindfoot inversion in a simulated ankle sprain in a quasi‐static and dynamic test mode at 0.5°/s and 50°/s internal rotation, respectively. Tests included intact specimens, same specimens with the ruptured anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), followed by stabilization with five different semi‐rigid orthoses: AirGo Ankle Brace, Air Stirrup Ankle Brace, Dyna Ankle 50S1, MalleoLoc, and Aequi. Compared to the injured and unprotected state, two orthoses (AirGo and Air Stirrup) significantly reinforced the ankle. The Aequi ankle brace restored stability comparable to an intact joint. Dyna Ankle 50S1 and MalleoLoc provided insufficient resistance to applied internal rotation compared to the ankle with ruptured ATFL. Ankle orthoses varied significantly in their ability to stabilize the unstable ankle during an ankle sprain in both testing modes. Presented objective data on passive stabilization reveal a lack of supporting evidence for clinical application of ankle orthoses."

Study Protocol for a Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled Single Centre Trial",2019-05-06,2019,preprint,"Background: Acute injuries of the hamstring muscle complex (HMC) Type 3b (interfascicle / bundle-tear) are frequently observed in various sports disciplines both in elite and recreational sport. The treatment of choice of acute HMC injuries Type 3b is a progressive physiotherapeutic exercise program. Besides this, there is currently only insufficient scientific evidence to support other treatment methods, including local infiltrations and injections of platelet-rich-plasma. Very recently it was demonstrated that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may accelerate regeneration after acute skeletal muscle injury. The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of radial ESWT (rESWT) and a specific rehabilitation program (RP) is effective and safe in treatment of acute HMC injury Type 3b in athletes, and is statistically significantly more effective than the combination of sham-rESWT and RP. Methods/Design: We will perform a double blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial at the clinic KinEf Kinesiolog&amp;iacute;a Deportiva, Ciudad Aut&amp;oacute;noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Fourty patients with acute HMC injury Type 3b will be randomly allocated to receive either rESWT (nine rESWT sessions; three sessions per week; 2500 radial extracorporeal shock waves (rESWs) per session; energy density depending on what the patient tolerates) or sham-rESWT. In addition, all patients will receive a specific rehabilitation program that will last for eight weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the individual time (days) necessary to return to play. Secondary outcomes will include the presence or absence of reinjury during a time period of six months after inclusion into the study. Discussion: Because of the lack of adequate treatment options for acute HMC injury Type 3b in athletes and particularly the high reinjury rate, we hypothesize that the results of this trial will be of importance and have impact on clinical practice.

High rates of meniscus tear combined with ACL rupture are observed, and these knees suffer a higher risk of early cartilage degeneration.This study investigated lower limb muscular force patterns of ACL-deficient knees with a concomitant medial meniscus tear.12 volunteers and 22 patients were recruited, including 12 patients with isolated ACL deficiency (ACLD) and 10 ACL-deficient patients with a concomitant medial meniscus tear (ACLDM). Level walking data at a self-selected speed were collected before surgery. Then, a musculoskeletal dynamic analysis system, AnyBody, was applied to simulate tibiofemoral flexion moments and muscle forces.Our results indicate that the tibiofemoral peak flexion and extension moments in ACLDM patients are significantly lower than in controls. The rectus femoris force in ACLDM patients was significantly lower than in isolated ACL-deficient patients and the controls during mid and terminal stance phase, while no significant difference was found in hamstring and vastus force. Additionally, the gastrocnemius force in ACL-deficient patients both with and without a medial meniscus tear was lower than in controls during mid-stance phase.The ACLDM patients had lower peak tibiofemoral flexion moment, lower gastrocnemius force in mid-stance phase, and lower rectus femoris force during the mid and terminal stance phase. These results may help clinicians to better understand the muscle function and gait pattern in ACL-deficient patients with a concomitant medial meniscus tear."

https://openalex.org/W2943655603,Eccentric Muscle Contractions: Risks and Benefits,2019-05-03,2019,review,"Eccentric contractions, characterized by the lengthening of the muscle-tendon complex, present several unique features compared with other types of contractions, which may lead to unique adaptations. Due to its specific physiological and mechanical properties, there is an increasing interest in employing eccentric muscle work for rehabilitation and clinical purposes. However, unaccustomed eccentric exercise is known to cause muscle damage and delayed pain, commonly defined as ‘‘Delayed-Onset Muscular Soreness’’ (DOMS). To date, the most useful preventive strategy to avoid these adverse effects consists of repeating sessions involving submaximal eccentric contractions which intensity is progressively increased over the training. Despite an increased number of investigations focusing on the eccentric contraction, a significant gap still remains in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initial damage response and subsequent adaptations to eccentric exercise. Yet, unraveling the molecular basis of exercise-related muscle damage and soreness might help uncover the mechanistic basis of pathological conditions as myalgia or neuromuscular diseases. In addition, a better insight into the mechanisms governing eccentric training adaptations should provide invaluable information for designing therapeutic interventions and identifying potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2946951340,Winning at all costs: a review of risk-taking behaviour and sporting injury from an occupational safety and health perspective,2019-05-02,2019,review,"Professional athletes involved in high-performance sport are at a high injury risk, which may lead to long-term health consequences. Professional athletes often expose themselves to risky behaviours, resulting in a higher acceptance level of occupational risk compared to other occupations. To date, many studies have focused on elite athletes' specific injury prevention techniques. The objective of this narrative review is to (1) summarise elite athletes' attitudes towards important occupational safety and health (OSH) practices, including injury reporting, medicine usage and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and (2) explore factors that may influence elite athletes' injury awareness. If injury awareness were given a similar weighting in elite sports as in any other highly physical occupation, the potential benefits to elite athletes and their long-term health could be highly significant. This review identifies that most elite athletes are not aware that sporting injuries are occupational injuries requiring behaviours determined by OSH rules. All the 39 studies identified met the moderate methodological quality criteria according to the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The factors impeding athletes' injury awareness from achieving occupational health standards are discussed from three safety management perspectives: organisational, societal and individual. This review contributes to a better understanding of how to build a positive safety culture, one that could reduce elite athletes' injury rate and improve their long-term wellbeing. Further research is required to develop a quantitative measurement instrument to evaluate occupational health awareness in the sport context. Based on the papers reviewed, the study population was categorised as elite, professional, high-performance amateur and student-athletes."

https://openalex.org/W2943517697,Patellar and hamstring autografts are associated with different jump task loading asymmetries after ACL reconstruction,2019-05-01,2019,article,"Abstract After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), there is a higher re‐injury rate to the contralateral limb in athletes who undergo surgery using a bone‐patellar‐tendon‐bone (BPTB) autograft than using a semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. This may be influenced by differing lower‐limb loading asymmetries present when athletes of each graft type return to play (RTP). The aim of this study was to compare bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) phase‐specific impulse asymmetries between athletes with BPTB and HT autografts 9 months post‐ACLR, and to identify the relationship between impulse and isokinetic strength asymmetries. Male field sport athletes with a BPTB (n = 22) or HT (n = 22) autograft were tested approximately 9 months post‐ACLR. An uninjured control group (n = 22) was also tested on a single occasion. Phase‐specific bilateral absolute impulse asymmetries were calculated during the CMJ and compared between groups using Kruskal‐Wallis and post‐hoc testing. A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between impulse asymmetries and isokinetic concentric knee extensor strength asymmetries. BPTB athletes demonstrated greater impulse asymmetries than HT athletes during the eccentric ( P = 0.01) and concentric ( P = 0.008) phases of the jump. Isokinetic strength asymmetry was a significant predictor of CMJ concentric impulse asymmetry in both BPTB ( r 2 = 0.39) and HT athletes ( r 2 = 0.18) but not eccentric impulse asymmetry in any group. The greater loading asymmetries demonstrated by BPTB than HT athletes 9 months after ACLR may contribute to the differing incidence rates of contralateral ACL injury. The findings suggest that graft‐specific loading asymmetries should be targeted during rehabilitation prior to RTP."

Fifteen healthy female collegiate soccer players performed dominant and non-dominant single-leg landings from a height of 40 cm. The three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremities were collected simultaneously with a 16-camera motion capture system and one force platform, respectively. Moreover, joint angle, joint range of motion, ground reaction force, joint moment, center-of-pressure, and absolute symmetry index (ASI%) were analyzed. Results corroborated that the range of motion in the knee and hip joints were significantly lower in the non-dominant than in the dominant leg. Meanwhile, the non-dominant leg exhibited higher medial–lateral center-of-pressure displacement than did the dominant leg. In addition, the ASI% for the peak ground reaction force and the loading rate exceeded 10% (peak ground reaction force: 11.31%, loading rate: 19.28%), which indicated asymmetry between the two legs during the single-leg landing impact. The findings also imply that for the female soccer players, the risk of injury (e.g. anterior cruciate ligament injury) can be higher in the non-dominant than in the dominant leg during unilateral dynamic movements."
https://openalex.org/W2965616447,STAR-Net: Action Recognition using Spatio-Temporal Activation Reprojection,2019-05-01,2019,article,"While depth cameras and inertial sensors have been frequently leveraged for human action recognition, these sensing modalities are impractical in many scenarios where cost or environmental constraints prohibit their use. As such, there has been recent interest on human action recognition using low-cost, readily-available RGB cameras via deep convolutional neural networks. However, many of the deep convolutional neural networks proposed for action recognition thus far have relied heavily on learning global appearance cues directly from imaging data, resulting in highly complex network architectures that are computationally expensive and difficult to train. Motivated to circumvent the challenges associated with training complex network architectures, we introduce the concept of spatio-temporal activation reprojection (STAR). More specifically, we reproject the spatio-temporal activations generated by human pose estimation layers in space and time using a stack of 3D convolutions. Experimental results on UTD-MHAD and J-HMDB demonstrate that an end-to-end architecture based on the proposed STAR framework (which we nickname STAR-Net) is proficient in single-environment and small-scale applications. On UTD-MHAD, STAR-Net outperforms several methods using richer data modalities such as depth and inertial sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2947996536,Passive cervical spine ligaments provide stability during head impacts,2019-05-01,2019,article,"It has been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatory cocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantify the relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head stabilization using an OpenSim musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle and ligaments during head impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase, active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase, active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limit the effectiveness of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations."

Data on concussed athletes were used to identify similar players with lower body injury and noninjury based on (1) position, (2) time loss, (3) time on the ice, and (4) team.The primary performance metric was a modified plus-minus statistic calculated by weighting the players' plus-minus metric by their team's simple rating system to account for varying team performances. Linear mixed models assessed the relationship between injury type (concussion, lower body, or noninjury) and performance (plus-minus score).We observed a quadratic effect for a time2 × group interaction ( \upchi _2^2 = 8.85, P = .01). This interaction revealed that the concussion and lower body injury groups had similar patterns of an initial decrease (ie, 2 weeks after return to play), followed by an increase in performance compared with the uninjured group in weeks 5 and 6. Meanwhile, the uninjured group had an initial increase in performance. We observed no group × linear time interaction (P = .47) or overall group effect (P = .57).The NHL players in the concussion and lower body injury groups displayed similar performance impairments. Both injured cohorts experienced an initial decrease in performance at weeks 1 to 2 after return to play, followed by improved performance at weeks 5 to 6 after return to play, suggesting that the performance implications of concussion may be short lived."

Players were divided into 3 groups: noninjured, nonoperative, and operative. Draft status, overall draft rank, missed games, batting average, and earned run average for the first 2 seasons of MLB play were obtained for all available players. Players across all 3 groups were compared with linear, logistic, and beta regression models, controlling for age, position, injury status, and draft rank. Unadjusted differences among groups were assessed with 1-way analysis of variance.Overall, 750 position players and 1140 pitchers were included, of whom 22.8% had no reported injury history; 48.8% reported injury treated nonoperatively; and 28.5% were treated operatively. The most common predraft injuries were elbow tendinitis (n = 312), ulnar collateral ligament injury (n = 212), and shoulder labral tear (n = 76). The most common predraft treatments were physical therapy (n = 922), ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (n = 115), and fracture fixation (n = 69). Of the 1890 players, 719 were drafted and played for at least 2 years. No difference was found among noninjured, nonoperative, and operative groups in terms of draft rank, games missed, or performance. Players with a nonoperative injury had a decreased odds ratio of being drafted (0.738; P = .017).More than half of the players entering the MLB reported a history of musculoskeletal injury requiring treatment, and the most commonly affected joints were the shoulder and elbow.

In addition, different PRP formulations that produce varying concentrations of leukocytes have not been directly compared for patellar tendinopathy.To determine if a single ultrasound-guided PRP injection, either leukocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) or leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP), was superior to saline injection for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy. The null hypothesis was that no treatment would be superior to another for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy.Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Athletes with patellar tendinopathy for ≥6 months (Blazina stage IIIB) were assessed for eligibility in a multisite single-blind controlled trial. There were 3 injection arms: LR-PRP, LP-PRP, and saline. Patients received a single ultrasound-guided injection, followed by 6 weeks of supervised rehabilitation (heavy slow resistance training, concentric and eccentric, 3 times per week). Outcome measures-Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (patellar; VISA-P), pain during activity, and global rating of change-were assessed at 6 and 12 weeks and 6 and 12 months. VISA-P score at 12 weeks was the primary outcome. Fifty-seven patients (19 in each group) were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcome measures included pain during activity and patients' global rating of change.Study retention was 93% at 12 weeks and 79% after 1 year. There was no significant difference in mean change in VISA-P score, pain, or global rating of change among the 3 treatment groups at 12 weeks or any other time point. After 1 year, the mean (SD) outcomes for the LR-PRP, LP-PRP, and saline groups were as follows, respectively: VISA-P-58 (29), 71 (20), and 80 (18); pain-4.0 (2.4), 2.4 (2.3), and 2.0 (1.9); global rating of change-4.7 (1.6), 5.6 (1.0), and 5.7 (1.2) ( P > .05 for all outcomes).Combined with an exercise-based rehabilitation program, a single injection of LR-PRP or LP-PRP was no more effective than saline for the improvement of patellar tendinopathy symptoms.NCT02116946 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier)."

Little information exists regarding the magnitude of traction forces at shoe-surface interface across a full season of elite football (soccer) using common football shoes. Objective To assess variation in shoe-surface traction of six different football shoe models throughout a full playing season in Qatar encompassing climatic and grass species variations. Methods Football shoes were loaded onto a portable shoe-surface traction testing machine at five individual testing time points to collect traction data (rotational and translational) on a soccer playing surface across one season. Surface mechanical properties (surface hardness, soil moisture) and climate data (temperature and humidity) were collected at each testing time point. Results Peak rotational traction was significantly different across shoe models (F = 218, df = 5, p <0.0001), shoe outsole groups (F = 316.2, df = 2, p < .0001), and grass species (F = 202.8, df = 4, p < 0.0001). No main effect for shoe model was found for translational traction (F = 2.392, p = 0.07). Conclusions The rotational (but not translational) traction varied substantially across different shoe types, outsole groups, and grass species. Highest rotational traction values were seen with soft ground outsole (screw-in metal studs) shoes tested on warm season grass. This objective data allows more informed footwear choices for football played in warm/hot climates on sand-based elite football playing surfaces. Further research is required to confirm if these findings extend across other football shoe brands."

https://openalex.org/W2945460618,Biomechanical Differences in Knee Valgus Angles in Collegiate Female Athletes Participating in Different Sports,2019-04-30,2019,article,"Background: Dynamic knee valgum is a major risk factor in ligamentous injuries of the knee. Different sports have higher rates of knee ligament injury than others and females experience knee non-contact ligament injuries at higher rates than their male counterparts. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the lower extremity biomechanics of genu valgum in female collegiate athletes of various sports while performing a drop jump test. This information may provide those designing individualized prevention programs assistance in reducing risk of knee ligamentous injury during jumping tasks. Methods: Current members of Idaho State University’s women’s basketball, soccer, and softball teams were evaluated for this study. Thirty-seven athletes participated. Motion capture reflective markers were placed bilaterally on the lower extremities to allow for analysis of knee biomechanics during a double-leg drop jump test. The angles of knee valgum in the frontal plane were calculated and analyzed between sport groups. Results: Female athletes of different sports displayed statistically significant differences in knee angles for both right, and left knees. Post hoc analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that basketball players utilized a more valgus right knee angle compared to both soccer and softball players and a more varus left knee angle compared with softball players. Conclusions: Our study suggests that collegiate-level female basketball players have an increased risk of right leg non-contact knee ligament injury during jump landing maneuvers when compared to collegiate level softball and soccer players due to increased knee valgus movements during the drop jump test. Collegiate-level female basketball players may benefit from biomechanical exercise interventions designed to decrease right knee valgus moments in jumping and landing to decrease their risk of injury."

Thirty-one right-handed skilled golfers (handicap, 3.5 ± 1.8) performed swings with a driver. The kinematic and kinetic data were collected using an optical motion analysis system and two force platforms. The dynamic factors (i.e., joint torque, gravitational force, motion-dependent forces and inertia forces) contributing to pelvis axial angular acceleration were calculated. The present study revealed that the left (lead) hip flexor and adductor torques as well as the right (trail) hip extensor and abductor torques were identified as the main contributors to pelvis axial angular velocity. These hip joint torques contributed not synchronously but sequentially to the pelvis. Although the knee joint torques contributed little to pelvis axial angular velocity directly, the knee joint torques might support the generation of large hip joint torques by regulating joint postures. These findings indicate that the functional coordination of the lower limb segments as well as the magnitude of the joint torques play an important role in rotating the pelvis."

The EG performed NHE (2-3 sessions/wk) in replacement of some handball-specific drills, whereas the CG followed regular handball training. Pretraining and posttraining tests were carried out for the assessment of sprint speed (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m), jump performance (countermovement jump [CMJ] height), change-of-direction (t test), and repeated-sprint ability (RSA total time [RSAtotal], RSA best time [RSAbest], and RSA fatigue index [RSAFI]). Data were analyzed using magnitude-based inferences.Within-group analyses for the EG showed moderate performance improvements for 5, 10, and 20 m (effect size [ES] = 0.68-0.82), t test (ES = 0.74), and CMJ (ES = 0.85). Trivial to small improvements were observed for RSA (ES = -0.06 to 0.35). For the CG, within-group outcomes showed performance decrements with moderate (t test [ES = 0.71]), small (5 m [ES = 0.46] and RSAbest [ES = 0.20]), and trivial magnitude (10 m [ES = 0.10], 20 m [ES = 0.16], and RSAtotal [ES = 0.00]). Furthermore, trivial to small performance improvements were found for CMJ (ES = 0.10) and RSAFI (ES = 0.5). Between-group analyses revealed small to large effects in favor of EG for 5 m (ES = 1.07), 10 m (ES = 0.66), 20 m (ES = 0.53), t test (ES = 1.38), and RSA (ES = 0.68-0.78). A trivial between-group difference was demonstrated for CMJ (ES = -0.01).The NHE training intervention, in replacement of some handball-specific drills, was more effective than regular handball training in improving physical performance (ie, linear sprint time, jumping, change-of-direction, and RSA) in young female handball players."

Accordingly, we present a 38-week case study characterizing whole body and regional rates of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (as inferred by assessments of fat-free mass from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) in a professional male soccer player from the English Premier League. In addition, in Week 6, we also quantified energy intake (via the remote food photographic method) and energy expenditure using the doubly labeled water method. Mean daily energy intake (CHO: 1.9–3.2, protein: 1.7–3.3, and fat: 1.4–2.7 g/kg) and energy expenditure were 2,765 ± 474 and 3,178 kcal/day, respectively. In accordance with an apparent energy deficit, total body mass decreased by 1.9 kg during Weeks 1–6 where fat-free mass loss in the injured and noninjured limb was 0.9 and 0.6 kg, respectively, yet, trunk fat-free mass increased by 0.7 kg. In Weeks 7–28, the athlete was advised to increase daily CHO intake (4–6 g/kg) to facilitate an increased daily energy intake. Throughout this period, total body mass increased by 3.6 kg (attributable to a 2.9 and 0.7 kg increase in fat free and fat mass, respectively). Our data suggest it may be advantageous to avoid excessive reductions in energy intake during the initial 6–8 weeks post anterior cruciate ligament surgery so as to limit muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2937523084,Relationship between split-step timing and leg stiffness in world-class tennis players when returning fast serves,2019-04-29,2019,article,"This study investigated split-step timing when returning serves and whether this timing is related to neuromechanical capabilities in world-class tennis players. In Experiment 1, the split-step timing of four groups of world-class players (male and female ATP/WTA seniors, and ITF juniors) was measured on court when returning serves of the same level players. The four groups initiated the split-step at a similar time, starting around the time ball-racket contact in the serve stroke and landed when early ball-flight information was available. In Experiment 2, the neuromechanical capabilities (leg stiffness and vertical jump performance) of a group of world-class players and three groups of less-skilled tennis players were examined. The results showed an increase in leg stiffness with an increase in the level of expertise. A cross-experiment analysis in world-class male players (ATP/ITF, n = 10) revealed that the timing of initial foot movement was significantly correlated with the leg stiffness (r2 = 0.54), with later lateral step after the serve in the players who had higher stiffness. The findings support the hypothesis that world-class tennis players adapt perceptual-motor control on the basis of their neuromechanical capabilities and maximise the time before initiating their interceptive action to rely on more reliable information."

Objective : To describe lower-body injury patterns and to determine whether a screening hip physical examination is predictive of future injuries in elite adolescent female soccer athletes. Design : Prospective cohort study. Setting : One US premier soccer club. Participants : One hundred seventy-seven female soccer athletes aged 10–18 years (mean [SD] 14.6 [1.8] y) completed a demographic questionnaire and screening hip physical examination that included range of motion and provocative tests. Interventions : At least 5 years after baseline screening, athletes completed an electronic follow-up injury survey. Injury was defined as pain that interfered with sporting activity. Main Outcome Measures : In addition to descriptive analyses of athletes’ injury profiles, associations between players’ baseline demographics and subsequent injury profiles were evaluated using chi-square tests, and potential predictors of injury based on players’ baseline hip examinations were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results : Ninety-four of 177 athletes (53%) were contacted for follow-up, and 88/94 (93.6%) completed the survey. With mean follow-up of 91.9 (9.3) months (range 66–108 mo), 42/88 (47.7%) reported sustaining a new lower-body injury. The low back was the most common injury region (16/42, 38.1%). Almost half of all injured athletes (20/42, 47.6%) sustained overuse injuries, and 16/42 (38.1%) had an incomplete recovery. Higher body mass index and reaching menarche were associated with sustaining an injury ( P = .03 and .04, respectively). Athletes’ baseline hip examinations were not predictive of their subsequent rate of lower-body, lumbopelvic, overuse, or incomplete recovery injury (all P &gt; .05). Conclusions : Lower-body injuries were common in elite adolescent female soccer athletes, with over one third of injured athletes reporting permanent negative impact of the injury on their playing ability. Baseline hip physical examinations were not associated with future injury rate."

These injuries are often treated with early surgery. However, early surgery may not be practical for the professional athlete. We report on the outcome of delayed primary repair of chronic RCL injuries without the use of tendon grafts or tendon transfers. Methods: Twelve elite professional athletes with 15 soft tissue RCL injuries who underwent delayed surgery (greater than 6 weeks) were included in this study. Athletes were managed with splinting and ongoing play during the sporting season, and underwent surgery at the conclusion of the season. Mean duration from injury to surgery was 5 months. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years after surgery. Patient-report outcome measures including pain, satisfaction rating, and disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scores were collected. Examination findings including range of motion, laxity, and grip and pinch strength were also measured. Return-to-play data were collected for all athletes. Results: The RCL was able to be primarily repaired with suture anchors in all cases. All twelve patients were able to return to competitive play at the same pre-injury professional level. Post-operative joint function such as range of motion and laxity were comparable to the unaffected contralateral side, as were grip and lateral pinch strengths. Tip-pinch strength is lower compared to the unaffected side, but is comparable to age and sex-matched reference group. Conclusions: Delayed primary repair of the RCL is a viable option and results in satisfactory long-term outcomes. This option may be more preferable to the professional athlete who wishes to avoid surgery during the sporting season."

Cryotherapy is commonly utilized by clinicians to provide local analgesia for minor acute knee joint musculoskeletal injuries during breaks in play or at halftime. Its effect on dynamic postural balance remains unclear. Objective : To investigate the acute effects of a 15-minute knee joint cryotherapy application on dynamic postural balance, as assessed primarily via a clinically oriented outcome measure. Design : Experimental study. Setting : University biomechanics laboratory. Patients or Participants : A total of 28 elite-level college male field-sport athletes. Intervention : Participants were tested on the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test both before and after a 15-minute knee joint cryotherapy application. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Normalized reach distances, 3-dimensional knee joint kinematics, sagittal plane hip and ankle joint kinematics, as well as fractal dimension of the center-of-pressure path during the performance of the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test. Results : There was a statistically significant decrease in reach distance scores achieved on anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test from precryotherapy to postcryotherapy ( P &lt; .05). None of the decreases in reach distance scores exceeded the reported smallest detectable difference values. No significant differences were observed in hip, knee, or ankle joint kinematics ( P &gt; .05). No significant change in fractal dimension was observed for any reach direction following cryotherapy application ( P &gt; .05). Conclusions : The results of the present study indicate that dynamic postural balance is unlikely to be adversely affected immediately following cryotherapy application to the knee joint."

However, unraveling the precise mechanisms by which geckos do this has been a long process, involving various approaches over the last two centuries. Our understanding of the principles by which gecko adhesion operates has advanced rapidly over the past 20 years and, with this knowledge, material scientists have attempted to mimic the system to create artificial adhesives. From a biological perspective, recent studies have examined the diversity in morphology, performance, and real-world use of the adhesive apparatus. However, the lack of multidisciplinarity is likely a key roadblock to gaining new insights. Our goals in this paper are to 1) present a historical review of gecko adhesion research, 2) discuss the mechanisms and morphology of the adhesive apparatus, 3) discuss the origin and performance of the system in real-world contexts, 4) discuss advancement in bio-inspired design, and 5) present grand challenges in gecko adhesion research.

https://openalex.org/W2941943171,Foot Motion Character During Forward and Backward Walking With Shoes and Barefoot,2019-04-25,2019,article,"Backward walking (BW) has been extensively used in athletic training and orthopedic rehabilitation as it may have value for enhancing balance. This study identified the differences in foot intersegment kinematics (forward walking (FW) vs. time-reversed BW) and plantar pressure parameters of 16 healthy habitually shod individuals walking FW and BW using flexible shoes (SH) and under barefoot conditions (BF). BW was found to have shorter stride length (SL) and higher stride frequency (SF) under BF conditions compared with SH, which indicates a better BW gait stability under BF conditions. Decreased HX/FF dorsiflexion at HO in BW induces less plantar aponeurosis tension which may inhibit the windlass mechanism compared to FW walking. Increased forefoot relative to hindfoot (FF/HF) pronation and sequentially hindfoot relative to tibia (HF/TB) eversion combined with medially distributed plantar pressure and a higher plantar contact area in the medial side in BW–BF maybe beneficial in maintaining balance. These results indicate that BW training may be more reliable under BF conditions compared to the SH conditions based on greater sensory information feedback from the plantar area resulting in better biomechanical behavior."

Our trust in experts largely depends on the assumption that their advice is based on reliable evidence. In many fields, the evaluation of the reliability of evidence is made on the basis of standards that originate from evidence-based medicine. I show that at the Olympic or professional level, implementing nutritional plans in real-world competitions requires contextualization of knowledge in a way that contravenes the tenets of evidence-based thinking. Nutrition experts need to be able to combine and apply evidence from multiple sources, including the previous successes and failures of particular athletes. I argue that in this sense, the practice of elite sport nutrition embodies casuistic reasoning."

For each of the tests, the participants were evaluated twice (on two consecutive days) by each physiotherapist. Both the intra- and inter-rater reliability were determined. Cohen's kappa (k) was calculated for the 1LHET, the EC and FC tests and the SST. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for the BHT and the 747BT. A confidence level of 95% (p ≤ 0.05) was applied as the criterion for determining the statistical significance of the results.The SST presented with the lowest level of intra-rater agreement (ICC = -0.20 to 0.10). On the other hand, the EC test was the only test where one rater achieved an excellent intersessional agreement (k = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-1.20). Substantial to excellent results for the inter-rater agreement for both sessions were recorded for the 1LHET (k = 0.70-0.90) and the BHT (ICC = 0.70-0.90).Reliability values need to be considered when making clinical decisions based on screening tests.

The aim of this study was to investigate if AO combined with immediate conventional training was able to improve motor performance and kinematic parameters of a complex motor skill such as the lineout throw, a gesture that represents a key aspect of rugby, that is unique to this sport. Twenty elite rugby players were divided into two groups. The AO group watched a 5-min video-clip of an expert model performing the lineout throw toward a target at 7 m distance and, immediately after the AO, this group executed the conventional training, consisting of six repetitions x five blocks of throws. The CONTROL group performed only the conventional lineout training. Intervention period lasted 4 weeks, 3 sessions/week. The AO group showed significant improvements in throwing accuracy (i.e., number of throws hitting the target), whilst no significant changes were observed in the CONTROL group. As concerns kinematic parameters, hooker's arm mean velocity significantly increased in both groups, but the increase was higher in AO group compared to CONTROL group. Ball velocity significantly increased only in the AO group, whereas ball angle release and ball spinning significantly decreased in both groups, with no differences between groups. Finally, no significant changes in knee and elbow angles were observed. Our results showed that the combination of AO and conventional training was more effective than a conventional training alone in improving the performance of elite rugby players, in executing a complex motor skill, such as the lineout. This combined training led to significant improvements in throwing accuracy and in hooker's and ball's kinematic parameters. Since AO can be easily implemented in combination with conventional training, the results of this study can encourage coaches in designing specific lineout training programs, which include AO cognitive training."

However, children on the spectrum exhibit challenging behaviors that need to be considered when designing robots for them. A child could involuntarily throw a small social robot during meltdown and that could hit another person's head and cause harm (e.g. concussion). In this paper, the application of soft materials is investigated for its potential in attenuating head's linear acceleration upon impact. The thickness and storage modulus of three different soft materials were considered as the control factors while the noise factor was the impact velocity. The design of experiments was based on Taguchi method. A total of 27 experiments were conducted on a developed dummy head setup that reports the linear acceleration of the head. ANOVA tests were performed to analyze the data. The findings showed that the control factors are not statistically significant in attenuating the response. The optimal values of the control factors were identified using the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio optimization technique.

Methods The material consists of hip and proximal thigh magnetic resonance images of Finnish female athletes (N = 91) engaged in either high jump, triple jump, soccer, squash, powerlifting, endurance running or swimming, and a group of physically active nonathletic women (N = 20). Cross‐sectional bone geometric properties were calculated for the lesser trochanter, sub‐trochanter, and mid‐shaft of the femur regions. Bone geometric properties were analyzed using a general linear model that included body size, muscle size, and muscle strength as covariates. Results Body size and isometric muscle strength were positively associated with bone geometric properties at all three cross‐sectional levels of the femur, while muscle size was positively associated with bone properties only at the femur mid‐shaft. When athletes were compared to nonathletic females, triple jump, soccer, and squash resulted in greater values in all studied cross‐sections; high jump and endurance running resulted in greater values at the femoral mid‐shaft cross‐section; and swimming resulted in lower values at sub‐trochanter and femur mid‐shaft cross‐sections. Conclusions Activity effects from ground impact loading were associated with higher bone geometric values, especially at the femur mid‐shaft, but also at lesser and sub‐trochanter cross‐sections. Bone geometric properties along the femur can be used to assess the mechanical stimuli experienced, where ground impact loading seems to be more important than muscle loading."

Knee injuries account for a significant portion of injuries in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football league; however, the effect of artificial surfaces on knee injuries remains ill-defined.There is no difference in the rate or mechanism of knee ligament and meniscal injuries during NCAA football events on natural grass and artificial turf playing surfaces.Descriptive epidemiology study.The NCAA Injury Surveillance System Men's Football Injury and Exposure Data Sets for the 2004-2005 through 2013-2014 seasons were analyzed to determine the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), medial meniscus, and lateral meniscal tear injuries. Injury rates were calculated per 10,000 athlete exposures, and rate ratios (RRs) were used to compare injury rates during practices and competitions on natural grass and artificial turf in NCAA football as a whole and by competition level (Divisions I, Divisions II and III). Mechanisms of injury were calculated for each injury on natural grass and artificial turf surfaces.A total of 3,009,205 athlete exposures and 2460 knee injuries were reported from 2004 to 2014: 1389 MCL, 522 ACL, 269 lateral meniscal, 164 medial meniscal, and 116 PCL. Athletes experienced all knee injuries at a significantly higher rate when participating in competitions as compared with practices. Athletes participating in competitions on artificial turf experienced PCL injuries at 2.94 times the rate as those playing on grass (RR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.61-5.68). When stratified by competition level, Division I athletes participating in competitions on artificial turf experienced PCL injuries at 2.99 times the rate as those playing on grass (RR = 2.99; 95% CI, 1.39-6.99), and athletes in lower NCAA divisions (II and III) experienced ACL injuries at 1.63 times the rate (RR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-2.45) and PCL injuries at 3.13 times the rate (RR = 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14-10.69) on artificial turf as compared with grass. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of MCL, medial meniscal, or lateral meniscal injuries on artificial turf versus grass when stratified by event type or level of NCAA competition. No difference was found in the mechanisms of knee injuries on natural grass and artificial turf.Artificial turf is an important risk factor for specific knee ligament injuries in NCAA football. Injury rates for PCL tears were significantly increased during competitions played on artificial turf as compared with natural grass. Lower NCAA divisions (II and III) also showed higher rates of ACL injuries during competitions on artificial turf versus natural grass."

Here we take a step towards a more real-world motor neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and the sports of pool billiards to frame a real-world skill learning experiment. First, we asked if well-known features of motor learning in lab-based experiments generalize to a real-world task. We found similarities in many features such as multiple learning rates, and the relationship between task-related variability and motor learning. Our data-driven approach reveals the structure and complexity of movement, variability, and motor-learning, enabling an in-depth understanding of the structure of motor learning in three ways: First, while expecting most of the movement learning is done by the cue-wielding arm, we find that motor-learning affects the whole body, changing motor-control from head to toe. Second, during learning, all subjects decreased their movement variability and their variability in the outcome. Subjects who were initially more variable were also more variable after learning. Lastly, when screening the link across subjects between initial variability in individual joints and learning, we found that only the initial variability in the right forearm supination shows a significant correlation to the subjects’ learning rates. This is in-line with the relationship between learning and variability: while learning leads to an overall reduction in movement variability, only initial variability in specific task-relevant dimensions can facilitate faster learning."
https://openalex.org/W2937462687,Measurement of physical activity in clinical practice using accelerometers,2019-04-16,2019,review,"Abstract Accelerometers are commonly used in clinical and epidemiological research for more detailed measures of physical activity and to target the limitations of self‐report methods. Sensors are attached at the hip, wrist and thigh, and the acceleration data are processed and calibrated in different ways to determine activity intensity, body position and/or activity type. Simple linear modelling can be used to assess activity intensity from hip and thigh data, whilst more advanced machine‐learning modelling is to prefer for the wrist. The thigh position is most optimal to assess body position and activity type using machine‐learning modelling. Frequency filtering and measurement resolution needs to be considered for correct assessment of activity intensity. Simple physical activity measures and statistical methods are mostly used to investigate relationship with health, but do not take advantage of all information provided by accelerometers and do not consider all components of the physical activity behaviour and their interrelationships. More advanced statistical methods are suggested that analyse patterns of multiple measures of physical activity to demonstrate stronger and more specific relationships with health. However, evaluations of accelerometer methods show considerable measurement errors, especially at individual level, which interferes with their use in clinical research and practice. Therefore, better objective methods are needed with improved data processing and calibration techniques, exploring both simple linear and machine‐learning alternatives. Development and implementation of accelerometer methods into clinical research and practice requires interdisciplinary collaboration to cover all aspects contributing to useful and accurate measures of physical activity behaviours related to health."

The inadequate number of donors combined with many challenges associated with autografts, allografts, xenografts, and prosthetic devices have added to the value of engineering biological substitutes, which can be implanted to repair the damaged tendons. Electrospun scaffolds have the potential to mimic the native tissue structure along with desired mechanical properties and, thus, have attracted noticeable attention. In order to improve the biological responses of these fibrous structures, we designed and fabricated 3D multilayered composite scaffolds, where an electrospun nanofibrous substrate was coated with a thin layer of cell-laden hydrogel. The whole construct composition was optimized to achieve adequate mechanical and physical properties as well as cell viability and proliferation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were differentiated by the addition of bone morphogenetic protein 12 (BMP-12). To mimic the natural function of tendons, the cell-laden scaffolds were mechanically stimulated using a custom-built bioreactor. The synergistic effect of mechanical and biochemical stimulation was observed in terms of enhanced cell viability, proliferation, alignment, and tenogenic differentiation. The results suggested that the proposed constructs can be used for engineering functional tendons."

However, outcomes in specific sports and physical activities remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess sports and physical activities in young patients following first MTP joint arthrodesis and to compare these results with clinical outcomes.Patients between ages 18 and 55 years who underwent MTP arthrodesis were identified by review of a prospective registry. Fifty of 73 eligible patients (68%) were reached for follow-up at a mean of 5.1 (range, 2.2-10.2) years with a mean age at surgery of 49.7 (range, 23-55) years. Physical activity was evaluated with a previously developed sports-specific, patient-administered questionnaire. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS).Patients participated in 22 different sports and physical activities. The most common were walking, biking, weightlifting, swimming, running, and golf. Compared to preoperatively, patients rated 27.4% of activities as less difficult, 51.2% as the same, and 21.4% as more difficult. Patients returned to 44.6% of preoperative physical activities in less than 6 months and reached their maximal level of participation in 88.6% of physical activities. Ninety-six percent of patients (48/50) were satisfied with the procedure regarding return to sports and physical activities. Improvements in the FAOS Symptoms subscore were associated with increased postoperative running and walking duration, and improvements in FAOS Pain subscores were associated with greater patient satisfaction.Patients were able to participate in a wide variety of sports and physical activities postoperatively. Some patients reported increased difficulty, but were nonetheless satisfied with the procedure regarding physical activity participation. These findings suggest that first MTP joint arthrodesis is a reasonable option in young, active patients, and may be used to guide postoperative expectations.Level IV, retrospective case series."

The purpose of this study was to examine biomechanical characteristics in the chasse step movement patterns between professional athletes (PA) and beginner players (BP). Large data sets were obtained for comparison by capturing kinematic and kinetic information of the dominant foot using the Oxford Foot Model (OFM) during table tennis strokes. Nine male PA and nine BP (all with dominant right feet) participated in a table tennis footwork test. A Vicon motion analysis system and a Novel Pedar insole plantar pressure measurement system were used to record kinematic and kinetic data, respectively. Findings from the study indicated that PA not only showed significantly larger forefoot and rear-foot dorsiflexion, but also demonstrated larger hallux plantarflexion. Also, PA showed significantly larger forefoot inversion and abduction at the forward-end of the step. Peak pressure values were higher under the lateral forefoot, and the medial and lateral rear-foot with faster changes in angular velocity recorded for PA during the chasse step phase. Greater peak pressures were also recorded under the other toes, and in the central and lateral forefoot during the forward swing phase when compared to BP. The results of the present study demonstrated that PA possessed greater foot drive technique. These findings may help coaches and beginners to comprehend the internal mechanisms of the chasse step technique and assist beginners in improving the mechanical efficiency of their performance."

This is then followed by the antagonist muscle (quadriceps) contracting. Secondly, the impact of the stretch on performance was examined. Methods: A randomised control trial was used. Forty healthy active males between 21 and 35 years of age were assigned to either receive three repetitions of CRAC or rest. Hamstring flexibility and the Illinois Agility Test were the primary outcome measures. Results: The intervention was effective in improving hamstring flexibility by 37% immediately post-application and this was maintained for eight minutes thereafter. It had no significant effect on agility or sprint times. Conclusions: CRAC applied to stretch the hamstring muscles of active males resulted in a large increase of active knee extension range of motion, without decreasing performance. CRAC appears to be a safe and effective method of increasing the length of the hamstrings pre-sport activity and should be utilised by sports physiotherapists if deemed necessary and beneficial following initial assessment."

https://openalex.org/W2937349176,Visual-Spatial Memory Deficits Are Related to Increased Knee Valgus Angle During a Sport-Specific Sidestep Cut,2019-04-15,2019,article,"Background: Identifying athletes at an increased risk of injury is a promising approach to improve the effect of injury prevention interventions; however, it requires first identifying the potential athlete-specific risk factors. Cognitive ability was recently shown to correlate with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury rates and lower extremity mechanics, marking an underexplored area. A better understanding of how individuals’ cognitive ability is associated with neuromuscular control during sport-specific tasks may improve injury prevention. Hypothesis: Athletes with lower cognitive performance on a standardized cognitive assessment would demonstrate greater increases in knee valgus angle and moment when performing a sidestep cut with soccer ball dribbling versus without. Visual-spatial memory was expected to demonstrate stronger relationships than reaction time or processing speed. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen male collegiate club soccer players participated (mean ± SD: 20.7 ± 2.0 years, 1.78 ± 0.07 m, 76.5 ± 8.9 kg). Participants performed anticipated 45° run-to-cut trials with and without a dual task of dribbling a soccer ball. Peak early-stance knee valgus angle and moment for the plant limb were calculated. Participants also completed a cognitive assessment to evaluate visual memory, verbal memory, reaction time, and processing speed. These composite scores were entered as candidate predictors for a stepwise regression analysis on the dual-task change scores in lower extremity biomechanical parameters (ie, ball handling – non–ball handling). Results: Visual memory composite score (a measure of visual-spatial memory) was the only cognitive outcome significantly associated with the change in biomechanical parameters. Each unit decrease in the visual memory composite score was associated with an increase of 0.21°± 0.05° in peak knee valgus angle during the ball-handling task as compared with the non–ball handling task ( R 2 = 52%, P = .003). Conclusion: Visual-spatial memory was associated with neuromuscular control during a sidestep cutting task during soccer ball dribbling, with deficits in this cognitive domain being associated with increased peak knee valgus angle. Clinical Relevance: Assessing visual-spatial memory ability may provide useful information to better understand conditions associated with impaired neuromuscular control and to potentially identify athletes at an elevated risk for musculoskeletal injury."

Effect of COL5A1 , GDF5 , and PPARA genes on a movement screen and neuromuscular performance in adolescent team sport athletes. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2057–2065, 2019—The risk of injury increases with adolescents' chronological age and may be related to limited muscle function neuromuscular, genetic, and biomechanical factors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether COL5A1, PPARA, and GDF5 genes are associated with muscle functions and stretch-shortening cycle performance in adolescent athletes. One hundred forty-six youth players (14.4 ± 0.2 years) from various team sports (basketball n = 54, soccer n = 50, handball n = 32) underwent a manual test for muscle function, maturity estimation, functional bend test (FBT), passive straight leg raise (SLR) test, leg stiffness test, test of reactive strength index (RSI), and gene sampling for COL5A1, PPARA, and GDF5 . The χ 2 test did not show any differences in allele or genotype frequency between participants before and after peak height velocity. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that COL5A1 rs12722 CT heterozygotes had worse score in FBT ( p &lt; 0.001), worse score in SLR ( p = 0.003), and lower maturity offset ( p = 0.029, only in females) than TT homozygotes. Male GDF5 rs143383 GG homozygotes showed better score in SLR than AA and AG genotypes ( p = 0.003), and AA and AG genotypes in both sex had greater RSI than GG homozygotes (p = 0.016). The PPARA rs4253778 CC homozygotes had greater RSI than GG and GC genotypes ( p = 0.004). The CT genotype in COL5A1 rs12722 is possible predictor of functional movement disruption in the posterior hip muscle chain, causing shortening in FBT and SLR, which includes hamstrings function. CT genotype in COL5A1 rs12722 should be involved in programs targeting hamstring and posterior hip muscle chain."

https://openalex.org/W2950278290,Predicting soccer penalty success: an optimality model,2019-04-12,2019,dissertation,"The penalty shot in soccer is one of the most exciting one-on-one contests in sport, where a single kick of the ball can decide major tournaments and multimillion-dollar prizes. Successful shooters must use power and accuracy to kick the ball beyond the goalkeeper’s reach and into the goal; conversely, goalkeepers must predict the shooter’s intent and move accurately to intercept the ball. Each player’s performance is constrained by biomechanical trade-offs, and success relies on selecting the best strategy to overcome these constraints in myriad situations. Thus, the soccer penalty provides an ideal study system to investigate how the strategies of two competing agents interact to determine success or failure.The aim of this thesis was to quantify the trade-offs faced by shooters and goalkeepers during a soccer penalty, determine the strategies used to overcome them, and show how these strategies interact to affect the outcome. From these outcomes, I developed an optimality model that predicts the likelihood of success for different shooting strategies, accounting for the biomechanical trade-offs that constrain each player. The model can match individual shooters against individual goalkeepers to identify the shooting strategy with the best chance of success.In Chapter 2, I quantified the trade-off between speed and accuracy when kicking a ball. As expected, shooting precision decreased as shot speed increased. I also found that the likely dispersion of shots around a target was dependent on target height, kick technique, and player left- or right-footedness. Aiming at a target off the ground decreased precision compared with a target on the ground, and kicks made with the side of the foot were more accurate, while those made with the top of the foot generated greater speeds. Right-footed players tended to miss above the target and to the right, or below the target and to the left, with the opposite true for left-footed players.In Chapter 3, I identified a previously unknown trade-off between shot speed and unpredictability. Unpredictability is advantageous for a penalty-kicker because it makes the ball more difficult for the goalkeeper to defend. I found that goalkeepers were better able to predict the direction of fast side-foot shots compared with slow- or medium-paced side-foot shots. Furthermore, the direction of shots became easier to predict as the shooter’s kicking action neared contact with the ball. During a penalty, goalkeepers generally start to move toward a side of the goal before the kicker contacts the ball—thus, moving earlier gives them more time to move to reach and intercept a shot, while moving later increases the likelihood that they move in the correct direction. Ultimately, the likelihood that a goalkeeper moved in the correction direction was determined by an interaction between when they began to move and the speed and technique used to kick the ball.A penalty shooter selects where to aim and how fast to kick the ball, and a goalkeeper decides when to initiate movement relative to the shooter’s kicking action. Yet each player can be deceptive, giving the impression of kicking or moving to one side of the goal while doing the opposite. In Chapter 4, I quantified the strategies used by both players, and identified elements of these strategies that interact to affect the outcome of penalty shots. I found that shooters usually aimed toward the lower extremities of the goal, kicking at sub-maximal speeds with a side-foot technique (mean = 23.5 ms-1, SD = 1.9 ms-1, min = 16 ms-1, max = 30 ms-1)—suggesting that shooters prioritise accuracy over speed. Though shooters occasionally tried to be deceptive, goalkeepers were not susceptible to this strategy. Goalkeepers tended to move to either side of the goal, on average, 0.19 s (SD = 0.15 s) before the shooter kicked the ball, though certain individuals moved consistently earlier or later. Faster penalty shots elicited earlier movement in goalkeepers, and were harder to save, even when they were within reach. In contrast with shooters, goalkeepers rarely used a deceptive strategy.            In Chapter 5, I constructed a model based on trade-offs for shooters and goalkeepers that could be used to predict the likelihood of success for any shooter strategy. I parameterised the model with results from Chapters 2-4, and found that in general, faster shots aimed closer to the ground give the best chance of scoring. Importantly, the model can be used to compete individual shooters and goalkeepers to identify the best shooting strategy for that specific matchup. Therefore, a shooter matched against a goalkeeper who tends to move early should shoot toward the centre of the goal; if matched against a goalkeeper who tends to move late, shooting toward the extremities of the goal is the best strategy, with the optimal target location in the horizontal dimension dependent on shot speed and kick technique.Taken together, the results of this thesis indicate the outcome of a penalty shot in soccer is determined by a complex interaction between the shooter and goalkeeper strategies. For a shooter, whatever strategy they choose is subject to the inherent error involved when kicking a ball. However, with knowledge of the goalkeeper’s behaviour, they can select a strategy that directs the shot to regions of the goal unlikely to be defended."

The effects of high‐level athletic training on such measures of movement control have not, however, been thoroughly evaluated. This study investigated whether elite athletes (who regularly perform knee‐specific neuromuscular training) show greater dynamic knee robustness and/or different movement strategies than non‐athletic controls, in relation to overall knee function. Thirty‐nine women (19 athletes, 20 controls) performed standardized rebound side hops (SRSH) while a motion capture system synchronized with two force plates registered three‐dimensional trunk, hip, and knee joint angles and moments. Dynamic knee robustness was evaluated using finite helical axis (FHA) inclination angles extracted from knee rotation intervals of 10°, analyzed with independent t tests. Angle and moment curves were analyzed with inferential methods for functional data. Athletes had superior knee function (less laxity, greater hop performances, and strength) but presented similar FHA inclination angles to controls. Movement strategies during the landing phase differed; athletes presented larger (a) hip flexion angles (during 9%‐29% of the phase), (b) hip adduction moments (59%‐99%), (c) hip internal rotation moments (83%‐89%), and (d) knee flexion moments (79%‐93%). Thus, elite athletes may have a greater ability than non‐athletes to keep the knee robust while performing SRSH more efficiently through increased engagement of the hip. However, dynamic knee robustness associated with lower FHA inclination angles still show room for improvement, thus possibly decreasing knee injury risk."

Ten skilled weightlifters (five males and five females) completed a total of five power snatch trials with 60% of one repetition maximum. Vertical GRF (VGRF), horizontal GRF (HGRF), rate of vertical force development (VFD), rate of horizontal force development (HFD) and horizontal centre-of-pressure (HCOP) were extracted through a three-dimensional motion analyses and used as the GRF parameters. Multiple-regression (stepwise) analyses were conducted to evaluate the prediction of power with the GRF parameters being independent variables and determine the above-mentioned best combination. VGRF, VFD and HCOP were identified as significant predictors of power during the power snatch with up to 72% of the variance in power explained (VGRF and VFD: p < 0.01; HCOP: p < 0.05). Specifically, increased VGRF and decreased VFD and HCOP would increase power during the power snatch. In conclusion, a horizontal movement is inevitable as a counter movement before second pull during the power snatch. However, it needs to be minimised as increased VFD and HCOP would have negative impacts on power."

https://openalex.org/W2939461023,Distinguishing between the concepts of supply chain agility and resilience,2019-04-09,2019,article,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to add clarity to the multidimensional concepts of agility and resilience. In addition, this paper seeks to clarify the differences and similarities between the two concepts by integrating the distinct bodies of knowledge on agility and resilience. Design/methodology/approach A multidisciplinary systematic literature review is conducted. The concept of agility is explored through a review of the sports science, manufacturing, organizational, information systems and information systems development and supply chain literature bases. The concept of resilience is investigated through a review of the psychological and psychopathological, ecological, economic, organizational and supply chain literature bases. Findings Examining the complex relationship between the two constructs led to the emergence of six major dimensions to capture the concept of agility (i.e. ability to quickly change direction, speed/accelerate operations, scan the environment/anticipate, empower the customer/customize, adjust tactics and operations (flexibility), and integrate processes within and across firms). Similarly, six dimensions were uncovered for resilience (i.e. ability to resist/survive disruptions, avoid the shock altogether, recover/return to original form following disruption, speed/accelerate operations, adjust tactics and operations (flexibility) and scan the environment/anticipate). Agility and resilience were found to share three common dimensions (i.e. ability to adjust tactics and operations (flexibility), speed/accelerate operations and scan the environment/anticipate). Practical implications The identification of the common characteristics of agility and resilience carries important managerial implications from a resource allocation perspective. Allocating resources to the development of the common characteristics of agility and resilience can help firms maximize the impact of such investments. That is, by investing in the common characteristics of both they can improve supply chain agility and supply chain resilience. If firms approach the development or improvement of supply chain agility or resilience independent from one another, without an awareness of the common characteristics, they could be duplicating their investments resulting in supply chain redundancies and inefficiencies. Originality/value Not having a clear and comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between agility and resilience is problematic from a theoretical perspective. A clear understanding of what each construct represents provides a platform for building generalizable theory by helping researchers operationalize these constructs in a consistent manner. Further, providing a generalizable, comprehensive and multidisciplinary perspective on agility and resilience within supply chain management literature can help increase the visibility of the field of supply chain management across other disciplines as scholars outside the field of supply chain management can utilize the results of this research effort."

https://openalex.org/W2939877474,Modelling human pathology of traumatic brain injury in animal models,2019-04-09,2019,review,"Abstract Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is caused by a head impact with a force exceeding regular exposure from normal body movement which the brain normally can accommodate. People affected include, but are not restricted to, sport athletes in American football, ice hockey, boxing as well as military personnel. Both single and repetitive exposures may affect the brain acutely and can lead to chronic neurodegenerative changes including chronic traumatic encephalopathy associated with the development of dementia. The changes in the brain following TBI include neuroinflammation, white matter lesions, and axonal damage as well as hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein. Even though the human brain gross anatomy is different from rodents implicating different energy transfer upon impact, especially rotational forces, animal models of TBI are important tools to investigate the changes that occur upon TBI at molecular and cellular levels. Importantly, such models may help to increase the knowledge of how the pathologies develop, including the spreading of tau pathologies, and how to diagnose the severity of the TBI in the clinic. In addition, animal models are helpful in the development of novel biomarkers and can also be used to test potential disease‐modifying compounds in a preclinical setting."

The experimental factors considered are: room temperature (A), indentation velocity (B), indenter temperature (C), pump pressure (D) and muscle activation (E). An inverse method was developed to obtain the constants for constitutive equations of a multilayer biological model (skin, hypodermis, and muscle) through the use of indentation tests in combination with a finite element method. For each combination of the experimental factors, two groups of constants were established from the inverse method. Sixteen combinations of experimental conditions and their corresponding constants for the Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equations were obtained to be used in further numerical models. The factor D and factor interactions ADE, CDE, and ACDE were statistically significant with respect to skin mechanical response. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is not a current equation able to represent the mechanical properties of the skin under all the experimental conditions considered in this study."

Players are required to have both a high racket speed and quick swing ability. On the other hand, a large movable range during a back swing may be disadvantageous for realizing a rapid, high-speed swing. Against this background, we sought to investigate the shoulder and torso joint movement characteristics of elite table tennis players when performing topspin forehands with 3 types of body movement, and to clarify the relationship between the maximum range of motion and swing skill. Ten male elite players participated in this experiment. Each performed 3 types of stroke trial (chance ball task, step over task, and step around task) and the active ranges of motion in the shoulder and torso joints (ROM trial) were measured. The three-dimensional coordinates of body landmarks (thorax, pelvis, and dominant humerus) and the racket during measurement were acquired using an optical motion capture system. The relationship between the maximum backward rotation angle at the shoulder and torso joint, the racket speed at ball impact, and the start time of the forward swing in each segment or joint were investigated. There was no significant difference in the maximum horizontal abduction angle at the shoulder joint between ROM trial and stroke trial (p > 0.2). Maximum torso backward rotation angle in ROM trial was significantly larger than that in the stroke trial (p < 0.05). In ROM trial and each stroke trial, the anatomical and functional flexibility of the shoulder and torso joints did not positively affect the racket speed and swing time. Rather, performance tended to be better during smaller backswings. Therefore, table tennis players require muscle strength or a technique that increases joint stiffness during racket swings."

Nonetheless, it is safe to assume genes play a critical role in clinical natural history. Without specific genetic determinants, clinicians must look to family history for useful information on clinically relevant inheritable traits. Identical twins offer a unique opportunity to bring these issues to light. Background: Case Presentation: Identical twin 14-year-old boys playing tackle football for the same high school team in the same position (linebacker) presented to a sports neurology clinic for evaluation on day 2 of symptom onset. Both describe sustaining multiple hits during the game against bigger opponents without one specific standout impact. By the end of the game, they both developed headaches with light and sound sensitivity, nausea and feeling off balance. Both felt their headaches worsened with an increase in intracranial pressure (i.e. coughing, bending over or yelling). Thorough neurologic family history revealed an older brother with two prior concussions without prolonged recovery. Both neurologic examinations were completely normal other than symptom production with vestibular ocular motor testing. The twins’ clinical management included taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication starting on day 2 and beginning light activity on day 3. Both were asymptomatic after day 4 and were re-evaluated in clinic on day 6 with completely normal neurological examinations. The stepwise return-to-play process was completed with their school athletic trainer. They were cleared to participate in sports without restrictions on day 7. Design/Methods: NA Results: NA Conclusions: Discussion: This case study highlights the importance of understanding the genetics of the concussed brain as a determinant of the injury’s clinical presentation. A thorough neurologic history including family history--particularly in the pediatric population--is paramount and should not be overlooked as it can elucidate genetic predispositions for developing patterns of neurologic presentations or for prolonged neurologic recovery from biomechanical forces.

In the SP trials, time to complete and error rate for each drill of the validated Western Hockey League Combines Testing Standard were recorded. Peak head accelerations, trunk contacts, and offensive performance were quantified during the SC trials using accelerometery and video analysis. RPE was assessed in both the SP and SC trials.RPE was significantly greater in the caffeine (11.3 [2.0]) than placebo (9.9 [1.9]) condition postpractice (P = .002), with a trend toward greater RPE in caffeine (16.9 [1.8]) than placebo (15.7 [2.8]) post-SC (P = .05). There was a greater number of peak head accelerations in the caffeine (4.35 [0.24]) than placebo (4.14 [0.24]) condition (P = .028). Performance times, error rate, and RPE were not different between intervention conditions during the SP trials (P > .05).A low dose of caffeine has limited impact on sport-specific skill performance and RPE but may enhance physicality during ice hockey SCs."

As a result, the biomechanical movement patterns in the lower limb during table tennis have attracted extensive attention from coaches, scientists and athletes. The purpose of this study was to compare the differences between the long and short chasse steps in table tennis and evaluate risk factors related to injuries in the lower limb. Materials and Methods: Twelve male elite athletes performed forehand topspin strokes with long and short chasse steps in this study, respectively. The kinematics data of the lower-limb joints were measured by a Vicon motion analysis system. The electromyograms (EMG) of six lower-limb muscles were recorded using a myoelectricity system. Results: The key findings were that the angle change rate of the ankle in the long chasse step was faster with a larger range of motion (ROM) in the coronal and transverse planes. The hip was also faster in the sagittal and transverse planes but slower in the coronal plane compared with the short chasse step. In addition, the vastus medialis (VM) was the first activated muscle in the chasse step. Conclusions: The hip and ankle joints in the long chasse step and the knee joint in the short chasse step have higher susceptibility to injury. Moreover, tibialis anterior (TA), vastus medialis (VM) and gastrocnemius (GM) should be sufficiently stretched and warmed prior to playing table tennis. The results of this study may provide helpful guidance for teaching strategies and providing an understanding of potential sport injury mechanisms."

The objective of this study is to develop new head injury criteria which can predict the greatest principal strain and shear stress in the brain considering the impact directions and magnitudes. So, 150 head impact simulations were performed for 3 magnitudes and 50 directions of impact using head finite element model (FEM). Simulations were performed in order to assess the strain and shear stress created in the brain tissues due to different impact directions and magnitudes. Next, new head injury criteria were developed through performing statistical analysis. The simulation results showed that TBI risks in the sagittal and frontal planes were higher than those with impacts in transverse plane. Furthermore, new brain injury indices were developed to predict maximum principal strain and shear stress in the brain, which had correlation coefficients of 0.85 and 0.89 with head FEM responses, respectively. However, finding of present research showed the effects of impact directions on TBI risks. They also demonstrate that impact magnitude, direction, and duration should be used to develop a brain injury index."

Effects of maturation on physical fitness adaptations to plyometric drop jump training in male youth soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 2760–2768, 2020—The objective of this study was to compare the effects of maturation on physical fitness adaptations to a twice weekly, 7-week plyometric drop jump training program. Seventy-six young male soccer players (aged 10–16 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. Before and after the intervention, a physical fitness test battery was applied (countermovement jump; drop jump from 20 to 40 cm; 5 multiple bounds test; 20-m sprint time; change of direction speed; 2.4-km running time-trial; 5 repetition maximum [RM] squat; and maximal kicking distance). Participants were randomly divided into an active soccer-control group (CG) with Tanner stage maturation of 1–3 (CG-early; n = 16) or Tanner stage 4–5 (CG-late; n = 22), and to plyometric drop jump training groups with Tanner stage 1–3 (plyometric jump training [PJT]-early; n = 16) or 4–5 (PJT-late; n = 22). The analysis of variance and effect size (ES) measures revealed that when compared with their age-matched controls, the PJT-early (ES = 0.39–1.58) and PJT-late (ES = 0.21–0.65) groups showed greater improvements ( p &lt; 0.05) in sprint time, 2.4-km running time-trial, change of direction speed, 5RM squat, jumping, and kicking distance. The PJT-early exceeded the PJT-late group with greater ( p &lt; 0.05) improvements in drop jump from 20 cm (ES = 1.58 vs. 0.51) and 40 cm (ES = 0.71 vs. 0.4) and kicking distance (ES = 0.95 vs. 0.65). Therefore, a 7-week plyometric drop jump training program was effective in improving physical fitness traits in both younger and older male youth soccer players, with greater jumping and kicking adaptations in the less-mature athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2925425560,Conditioning Brain Responses to Improve Quadriceps Function in an Individual With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2019-04-05,2019,article,"Background: Persistent quadriceps weakness and activation failure are common in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. A growing body of evidence indicates that this chronic quadriceps dysfunction could be partly mediated due to reduced corticospinal excitability. However, current rehabilitation approaches do not directly target corticospinal deficits, which may be critical for restoring optimal clinical outcomes after the surgery. This case study tested the feasibility of operant conditioning of torque responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to improve quadriceps function after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: Operant conditioning of motor evoked torque responses would improve quadriceps strength, voluntary activation, and corticospinal excitability. Study Design: Case study and research report. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Methods: A 24-year-old male with an ACL reconstruction (6 months postsurgery) trained for 20 sessions (2-3 times per week for 8 weeks) to increase his TMS-induced motor evoked torque response (MEP torque) of the quadriceps muscles using operant conditioning principles. Knee extensor strength, voluntary quadriceps muscle activation, and quadriceps corticospinal excitability were evaluated at 3 time points: preintervention (pre), 4 weeks (mid), and immediately after the intervention (post). Results: The participant was able to successfully condition (ie, increase) the quadriceps MEP torque after 1 training session, and the conditioned MEP torque gradually increased over the course of 20 training sessions to reach about 500% of the initial value at the end of training. The participant’s control MEP torque values and corticospinal excitability, which were measured outside of the conditioning paradigm, also increased with training. These changes were paralleled by improvements in knee extensor strength and voluntary quadriceps muscle activation. Conclusion: This study shows that operant conditioning of MEP torque is a feasible approach to improving quadriceps corticospinal excitability and quadriceps function after ACL reconstruction and encourages further testing in a larger cohort of ACL-reconstructed individuals. Clinical Relevance: Operant conditioning may serve as a potential therapeutic adjuvant for ACL rehabilitation."

The purpose of this study was to study the epidemiology and mechanisms of MCL injury in men's professional football and to evaluate the diagnostic and treatment methods used. Fifty-one teams were followed prospectively between one and three full seasons (2013/2014–2015/2016). Individual player exposure and time-loss injuries were recorded by the teams' medical staffs. Moreover, details on clinical grading, imaging findings and specific treatments were recorded for all injuries with MCL injury of the knee as the main diagnosis. Agreement between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical grading (grades I–III) was described by weighted kappa. One hundred and thirty of 4364 registered injuries (3%) were MCL injuries. Most MCL injuries (98 injuries, 75%) occurred with a contact mechanism, where the two most common playing situations were being tackled (38 injuries, 29%) and tackling (15 injuries, 12%). MRI was used in 88 (68%) of the injuries, while 33 (25%) were diagnosed by clinical examination alone. In the 88 cases in which both MRI and clinical examination were used to evaluate the grading of MCL injury, 80 (92% agreement) were equally evaluated with a weighted kappa of 0.87 (95% CI 0.77–0.96). Using a stabilising knee brace in players who sustained a grade II MCL injury was associated with a longer lay-off period compared with players who did not use a brace (41.5 (SD 13.2) vs. 31.5 (SD 20.3) days, p = 0.010). Three-quarter of the MCL injuries occurred with a contact mechanism. The clinical grading of MCL injuries showed almost perfect agreement with MRI grading, in cases where the MCL injury is the primary diagnosis. Not all grade II MCL injuries were treated with a brace and may thus indicate that routine bracing should not be necessary in milder cases. Prospective cohort study, II."

Eighteen male and 20 female participants completed a jump-landing-jump task in five conditions: no rotation, testing leg ipsilateral or contralateral (WBRC) to the whole-body rotation direction, and testing leg ipsilateral (TRI) or contralateral to the trunk rotation direction. The WBRC and TRI conditions demonstrated decreased knee flexion and increased knee abduction angles at initial contact (2.6 > Cohen's dz > 0.3) and increased peak vertical ground reaction forces and knee adduction moments during the 100 ms after landing (1.7 > Cohen's dz > 0.3). The TRI condition also showed the greatest knee internal rotation angles at initial contact and peak knee abduction and internal rotation angles and peak knee extension moments during the 100 ms after landing (2.0 > Cohen's dz > 0.5). Whole-body rotation increased contralateral knee loading because of its primary role in decelerating medial-lateral velocities. Trunk rotation resulted in the greatest knee loading for the ipsilateral knee due to weight shifting and mechanical coupling between the trunk and lower extremities. These findings may help understand altered trunk motion in anterior cruciate ligament injuries."

IST has been shown to induce less fatigue and resulted in superior joint angle specific strength than dynamic strength training, and benefited sports related dynamic performances such as running, jumping and cycling. IST may be included into athletes’ training regime to avoid getting overly fatigue while still acquiring positive neuromuscular adaptations; to improve the strength at a biomechanically disadvantaged joint position of a specific movement; to improve sports specific movements that require mainly isometric contraction; and when athletes have limited mobility due to injuries. To increase muscle hypertrophy, IST should be performed at 70–75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with sustained contraction of 3–30 s per repetition, and total contraction duration of&gt;80–150 s per session for&gt;36 sessions. To increase maximum strength, IST should be performed at 80–100% MVC with sustained contraction of 1–5 s, and total contraction time of 30–90 s per session, while adopting multiple joint angles or targeted joint angle. Performing IST in a ballistic manner can maximize the improvement of rate of force development."

Anatomical and biomechanical knowledge of the supporting structures that provide stability to the medial and lateral elbow is essential to correctly interpret the pathological findings. Conventional MRI and MR arthrography are the imaging modalities of choice in the evaluation of elbow ligament injuries. Elbow instability can be classified according to timing (acute, chronic, or recurrent), the direction of displacement, the degree of displacement, and the articulations involved. This article reviews the MR imaging protocols recommended for each diagnosis and the normal anatomy and biomechanical aspects of the medial and lateral collateral ligament complex. We also present multiple cases of typical and atypical patterns of injury."

Eighteen players were followed over 7 weeks, measuring four load parameters during every training and match: volume (minutes played), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (ranging from 6 to 20), weekly load (RPE*volume), and jump frequency (number of jumps). Patellar tendon structure was measured biweekly using UTC, which quantifies tendon matrix stability resulting in four different echo types (I‐IV). On average, players spent 615 min/wk on training and matches with an RPE of 13.9 and a jump frequency of 269. Load evaluation shows significant changes over the 7 weeks: Volume and weekly load parameters were significantly higher in week 3 than week 7 and in week 4 than week 2. Weekly load performed in week 4 was significantly higher than week 7. No significant changes were observed in tendon structure. On the non‐dominant side, no significant correlations were found between changes in load parameters and echo types. At the dominant side, a higher weekly volume and weekly load resulted in a decrease of echo type I and a higher mean RPE in an increase of echo type II. The results of this study show that both external and internal load influence changes in patellar tendon structure of elite male volleyball players. Monitoring load and the effect on patellar tendon structure may play an important role in injury prevention."

Cycle time was significantly greater in the braced condition (677.8 ± 43.7 ms) compared to taped (669.3 ± 44.6 ms) and FRT (672.1 ± 44.2 ms) conditions.Ankle taping and bracing were shown to be comparable in decreasing ankle kinematics and kinetics, while FRT caused minimal changes in running biomechanics. Taping and bracing may be beneficial in stabilizing and protecting the ankle while FRT should not be used to restrict ankle motion during running."

Understanding sports biomechanics is important for injury prevention and performance enhancement and is traditionally assessed using optical motion capture. However, such approaches are limited by capture volume restricting assessment to a laboratory environment, a factor that can be overcome by wearable technology. A systematic search was carried out across seven databases where wearable technology was employed to assess kinetic and kinematic variables in sport. Articles were excluded if they focused on sensor design and did not measure kinetic or kinematic variables or apply the technology on targeted participants. A total of 33 articles were included for full-text analysis where participants took part in a sport and performed dynamic movements relating to performance monitored by wearable technologies. Inertial measurement units, flex sensors and magnetic field and angular rate sensors were among the devices used in over 15 sports to quantify motion. Wearable technology usage is still in an exploratory phase, but there is potential for this technology to positively influence coaching practice and athletes' technique."
https://openalex.org/W2927083635,Artificial intelligence for understanding concussion: Retrospective cluster analysis on the balance and vestibular diagnostic data of concussion patients,2019-04-02,2019,article,"We propose a bottom-up, machine-learning approach, for the objective vestibular and balance diagnostic data of concussion patients, to provide insight into the differences in patients' phenotypes, independent of existing diagnoses (unsupervised learning).Diagnostic data from a battery of validated balance and vestibular assessments were extracted from the database of the Swiss Concussion Center. The desired number of clusters within the patient database was estimated using Calinski-Harabasz criteria. Complex (self-organizing map, SOM) and standard (k-means) clustering tools were used, and the formed clusters were compared.A total of 96 patients (81.3% male, age (median [IQR]): 25.0[10.8]) who were expected to suffer from sports-related concussion or post-concussive syndrome (52[140] days between diagnostic testing and the concussive episode) were included. The cluster evaluation indicated dividing the data into two groups. Only the SOM gave a stable clustering outcome, dividing the patients in group-1 (n = 38) and group-2 (n = 58). A large significant difference was found for the caloric summary score for the maximal speed of the slow phase, where group-1 scored 30.7% lower than group-2 (27.6[18.2] vs. 51.0[31.0]). Group-1 also scored significantly lower on the sensory organisation test composite score (69.0[22.3] vs. 79.0[10.5]) and higher on the visual acuity (-0.03[0.33] vs. -0.14[0.12]) and dynamic visual acuity (0.38[0.84] vs. 0.20[0.20]) tests. The importance of caloric, SOT and DVA, was supported by the PCA outcomes. Group-1 tended to report headaches, blurred vision and balance problems more frequently than group-2 (>10% difference).The SOM divided the data into one group with prominent vestibular disorders and another with no clear vestibular or balance problems, suggesting that artificial intelligence might help improve the diagnostic process."
https://openalex.org/W2934904006,Clinical and Anatomical Aspects of Anterior Dislocation of the Pisiform Bone,2019-04-02,2019,article,"Introduction The pisiform bone is the fourth bone of the proximal row of the carpal bones, and it is located in the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, being considered a sesamoid bone. Traumatic dislocation of the pisiform bone is a rare condition, which usually results from a trauma in dorsal flexion of the wrist. Its treatment can be conservative or surgical, ending or not with the removal of the pisiform bone. Objective To report a case of a child who fell from his own height and presented wrist pain, diagnosed with dislocation of the pisiform bone. We emphasize the importance of anatomy knowledge in the evaluation of wrist trauma. Case Report The anamnesis confirmed that the fall occurred with the wrist in hyperextension. The physical examination showed a slight limitation of movement due to pain. Radiographic exams and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the wrist were performed, in which an anterior deviation/luxation of the pisiform bone was evidenced. A conservative treatment with plaster immobilization for analgesia was performed for 1 week. As there were no symptoms and no signs of trauma consistent with the images, such as edema and local ecchymosis, in addition to the early complete disappearance of pain, the responsible team proposed the hypothesis of asymptomatic chronic dislocation of the pisiform bone. Conclusion Imaging exams in orthopedic traumatology are fundamental for an accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, they must be associated with knowledge of the anatomy to correlate the image findings with the anamnesis, leading to a better understanding of silent, asymptomatic, and preexisting conditions in the clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2935582171,Ulnar Collateral Ligament Repair With Collagen-Dipped FiberTape Augmentation in Overhead-Throwing Athletes,2019-04-01,2019,article,"Background: There has been a renewed interest in ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) repair in overhead athletes because of a greater understanding of UCL injuries, an improvement in fixation technology, and the extensive rehabilitation time to return to play. Purpose/Hypothesis: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of a novel technique of UCL repair with internal brace augmentation in overhead throwers. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients undergoing a novel technique of UCL repair with internal brace augmentation were prospectively followed for a minimum of 1 year. Potential candidates for repair were selected after the failure of nonoperative treatment when imaging suggested a complete or partial avulsion of the UCL from either the sublime tubercle or medial epicondyle, without evidence of poor tissue quality of the ligament. The final decision on UCL repair or traditional reconstruction was determined intraoperatively. Demographic and operative data were collected at the time of surgery. Return to play, and Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic (KJOC) scores were collected at 1 year and then again at 2 years postoperatively. Results: Of the 111 overhead athletes eligible for the study, 92% (102/111) of those who desired to return to the same or higher level of competition were able to do so at a mean time of 6.7 months. These patients had a mean KJOC score of 88.2 at final follow-up. Conclusion: UCL repair with internal brace augmentation is a viable option for amateur overhead throwers with selected UCL injuries who wish to return to sport in a shorter time frame than allowed by traditional UCL reconstruction."

Patients with chronic ankle instability describe a history of the ankle “giving way” with or without pathological laxity on examination. Evaluation includes history, identification of predisposing risk factors for recurrent sprains, and the combination of clinical tests (eg, laxity tests) with imaging to establish the diagnosis. There are a variety of nonoperative strategies to address chronic ankle instability, which include rehabilitation and taping or bracing to prevent future sprains. Patients who fail conservative treatment are candidates for surgery. The anatomic approaches (eg, modified Broström) are preferred to nonanatomic procedures since they recreate the ankle’s biomechanics and natural course of the attenuated ligaments. There is a growing interest in minimally invasive procedures via ankle arthroscopy that also address the associated intra-articular disorders. This article provides a review of chronic lateral ankle instability consisting of relevant anatomy, associated disorders, evaluation, treatment methods, and complications.

However, less is known regarding the management, severity, and outcomes of such injuries in contact athletes.To compare the incidence, severity, and outcomes of elbow UCL injuries between throwing and contact athletes in collegiate sports.Descriptive epidemiology study.Elbow UCL injuries were queried from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program between the seasons of 2009-2010 and 2013-2014 in 25 varsity sports. The rates and distribution of injuries by mechanism, participation restriction time, and outcomes (eg, season-ending injury, surgery) were examined. A severe injury was defined as loss of ≥21 days from participation, a season-ending injury, or requiring a surgical intervention. The injury frequency, incidence per 10,000 athlete-exposures (AEs), and injury proportion ratio comparing throwing and contact athletes were calculated with 95% CIs.Over the course of 5 seasons, 109 UCL injuries were recorded, for an overall injury rate of 0.29 per 10,000 AEs. Of these injuries, 83 (76.1%) were a result of contact and 26 (23.9%) from throwing. Men's wrestling (1.78 per 10,000 AEs) and men's baseball (1.12 per 10,000 AEs) sustained the highest injury rates. A larger proportion of throwing (n = 8; 36.4%) compared with contact (n = -7; 9.1%) (P < 0.01) injuries results in >21 days of time loss. Additionally, more throwing-related UCL injuries required surgery (n = 2; 11.1%) compared with contact-related injuries (n = 1; 1.3%) (P < 0.01). As a result, throwing athletes demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of severe injuries than contact athletes (injury proportion ratio, 4.62 [95% CI, 1.72-12.40]).The evaluation of athletes in 25 collegiate varsity sports across 5 seasons found over 3 times more elbow UCL injuries in contact versus throwing athletes. However, the number of severe injuries in throwing athletes was significantly higher than in contact athletes. These findings demonstrate that although elbow UCL injuries are prone to occur in both contact and throwing athletes, their prevention, management, and outcomes must be framed on a sport-by-sport basis."

PA was measured via a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer and PA grouped as daily total PA (TPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Perceived MC was assessed using the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Acceptance for Young Children. A total of 38 children (63% male; 37% female) aged between 3 and 6 years (5.41 ± 0.69) completed all assessments. Mediating impacts of perceived MC on the relationships between PA and MC were explored via backwards mediation regressions.There were no mediating impacts of perceived MC on the relationship between PA and actual MC.The relationship between actual MC and PA is not mediated by perceived MC in a small sample of British early years childhood.

However, the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries may hinder regular practice. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence of injuries in Brazilian street runners and the associated factors. A meta-analysis of Brazilian studies was performed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of injuries in male and female recreational street runners aged ≥18 years. We excluded systematic review studies, research conducted on professional athletes or triathletes, and duplicate articles. The following databases were used: SciELO, LILACS, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Keywords such as “prevalence,” “injury,” “recreational street runners,” and “Brazil” were used. Prevalence analysis was performed using the random effect model, and a funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. Then the Begg-Mazumdar and Egger tests were applied to quantify the graph results. The Prevalence Critical Appraisal Instrument was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. Associated factors were analyzed with meta-regression analysis. Twenty-three studies with 3,786 runners were included in the review. The prevalence of injury was 36.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.8-42.5%), and a running distance per week greater than 20 km was a predictive variable of injuries. A higher prevalence of injuries was observed in men than in women (28.3%, 95% CI 22.5-35.0%), the knee was the most affected site of injury (32.9%, 95% CI 26.7-39.6%), and muscle injuries were the most frequent type of injury (27.9%, 95% CI 18.2-40.1%). This is the first national meta-analysis conducted to investigate the prevalence of injuries in recreational street runners. Although the prevalence of injuries was moderate, caution is required in terms of the weekly duration of running. Male runners are more susceptible, and muscle and knee injuries are the most common.

Recent high-profile cases of professional road cyclists continuing to participate in races despite suffering obvious SRC have highlighted the difficulties in assessing SRC within road cycling.To undertake a systematic review of the literature on SRC assessment in road cycling.Systematic review.Literature describing SRC assessment in road cycling was identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility and a qualitative analysis was undertaken of included studies.From 94 studies identified, two were included for review. Gordon et al describe the presentation of a single case of paediatric concussion following a cycling crash. They highlight the utility of SRC evaluation using the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) as well as the importance of a stepwise return-to-play protocol. Greve and Modabber discuss a number of traumatic brain injuries that occurred during the 2011 road cycling season and, as a minimum, call for riders to be withdrawn from competition following loss of consciousness or amnesia. Both studies are at high risk of bias and of low quality.Road cycling poses unique challenges for the assessment of SRC. This review illustrates the lack of published evidence to advise effective means of SRC assessment within road cycling. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) regulations advise the use of SCAT-5 for concussion assessment but this tool is impractical, requiring modification for use in road cycling. We would like to call on the UCI to hold a consensus meeting to establish an evidence-based SRC assessment protocol and return-to-riding protocol for road cycling."

Etiology of AIS is unclear and the general belief is that AIS is multifactorial disorder possibly caused by different factors. It would be worthwhile to reveal new factors associated with AIS. The present study aimed to investigate association between sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction and AIS in young athletes.This case-control study included 196 children athletes (basketball, football, volleyball, handball, ballet, and others), 82 males and 114 females aged 8 to 17, 98 of them with the diagnosis of AIS. The case group consisted of young athletes examined at a regular checkup by a sport physician and diagnosed with AIS. The control group consisted of athletes matched to the case group according to sex, age, sports, number of training years and number of training hours per week, but without AIS.The scoliosis was diagnosed with Adams' forward bend test and the scoliometer measurement. The SIJ dysfunction was determined using the palpation meter (PALM) measuring the sagittal pelvic position in standing position and in standing position with the hip flexion angle of 90°. The data were analyzed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, contingency coefficients, and logistic regression.The average difference in pelvic position in the sagittal plane (in standing position), with and without hip flexion 90° was found to be statistically different in the case and the control groups (t = 13.88, P = .00). There was a strong positive association between variables representing presence of AIS and SIJ dysfunction (determined by contingency coefficient C = 0.62, coefficient Phi = 0.79 and tetrachoric correlation coefficient 0.95).The logistic regression indicated that the average difference in pelvic position in the sagittal plane (in standing position), with and without hip flexion 90° was significantly associated with the probability of scoliosis in young athletes (P = .00, Wald test).There was a strong positive association between SIJ dysfunction and AIS in young athletes."

Hence, we examined the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on performance in male amateur futsal players.Seventy-one male futsal players from six amateur clubs were recruited and randomized to an intervention (N.=37, age: 27.0±5.1 years) or a control group (N.=34, age: 26.0±5.1 years). The intervention group was submitted to 10 weeks of FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, 2 sessions/week, followed by a 10-week follow-up period, while the control group performed regular futsal warm-ups during the training sessions. During the follow-up period both groups performed only regular warm-ups during their training sessions. Physical performance was assessed by measuring agility (T-test), sprint (30 m sprint), flexibility (sit-and-reach test) and vertical jump performance (squat jump).Differences between groups were found at baseline for training exposure, body mass index, body weight, flexibility, and sprint. The results of the effect of the FIFA 11+ on the sit-and-reach test, speed and agility did not show differences pre-post intervention, as well as for the 10-week follow-up.

Over a decade ago, it was reported to account for about 85% of all cases of low back pain, although there is some doubt about the frequency. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of NSLBP in adolescent athletes diagnosed by general orthopedic surgeons and by spine surgeons. <h3>Materials and Methods:</h3> A total of 69 adolescent athletes consulted our sports spine clinic to seek a second opinion for low back pain. Data on age, sex, type of sport played, the previous diagnosis made by general orthopedic surgeons, and the final diagnosis made by spine surgeons were collected retrospectively from medical records. <h3>Results:</h3> The frequency of NSLBP diagnosed by general orthopedic surgeons was 18.9% and decreased to 1.4% after careful imaging and functional nerve block examination by spine surgeons. The final diagnoses made by spine surgeons for those patients previously diagnosed as having NSLBP by general orthopedic surgeons were as follows: early-stage lumbar spondylolysis, discogenic low back pain, facet joint arthritis, lumbar disc herniation, and lumbar apophyseal ring fracture. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> In adolescent athletes, the rate of NSLBP diagnosed by general orthopedic surgeons decreased markedly when the diagnosis was made by spine surgeons. A thorough medical interview, careful physical examination, appropriate diagnostic imaging, and selective nerve block examination can effectively identify the cause of low back pain."

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the association between LBP and selected biomechanical factors and postural stability during dynamic movement tasks in young athletes. <h3>Materials and methods</h3> 396 young floorball and basketball players (mean age 15.8±1.9) were included and followed prospectively for 1–3 years (2011–2014). In the beginning of every study year the players were tested. The physical tests included single-leg squat (SLS), single-leg vertical drop jump (SLVDJ), vertical drop jump (VDJ) and Star Reach Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Individual exposure time and LBP resulting in time-loss were recorded prospectively. Cox's proportional hazard models with mixed effects and time-varying risk factors were used. <h3>Results</h3> In SLVDJ landing with non-dominant leg, the risk for general LBP and non-traumatic LBP in specific, was significantly higher with increased femoral adduction (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.19 and HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.22, respectively) and significantly lower with increased in femur-pelvic angle (FPA; angle-between pelvis and femur) (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88–0.99 and HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.99, respectively). However, the ROC analysis revealed poor combined sensitivity and specificity for femoral adduction and for FPA. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Increased femoral adduction and decreased FPA during SLVDJ landing are associated with risk of LBP in young team ball players. However, the identified risk factors do not discriminate players with or without future LBP well enough and therefore further studies on effect of neuromuscular training on lumbo-pelvic control and LBP incidence are warranted."

However, research is scarce regarding how elderly-interventions can improve various SED- and PA-behavior. <h3>Purpose</h3> The aim with this study was to determine if eight-weeks of regular supervised exercise would have any effect on movement-patterns in elderly. For comparison, a control group, not receiving supervised exercise, performed similar pre- and end-tests intervals. Reliability of elderly accelerometer measures, in two separate pre-tests was also investigated. <h3>Methods</h3> Seventy-eight elderly exercised (65–91 years) and 43 participated in a control group (65–88 years). The exercise group had combined aerobic and strength-training, twice/w à 1 hour. Accelerometer assessments for the exercise group were performed three times; Pre-1 and Pre-2 and one test in the last week of the 8-week-exercise-period. The controls made one pre-test and one end-test at corresponding spring time intervals, without receiving any supervised physical activity. <h3>Results</h3> The exercise-group significantly improved from Pre-1 to End-test moderate-to-vigorous-PA-intensity (MVPA +41 min/week=+0.8% of-total-daily-wear-time), light-intensity (LPA +228 min/w=+3.9%), total-SED-time (−254 min/w=−4.7%) and SED-bouts-à−10 min (−320 min/w=−5.7%).

Between the exercise groups´ two pre-tests, no significant difference was observed, except for total-PA (+4.6%) and SED-total (−2.4%). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Elderly participating in supervised exercise increase PA- and decrease SED-time, which is of importance because it is linked with improved health for elderly, longevity and potent socioeconomic gains."
https://openalex.org/W2938370353,Impact Mechanics of Football Helmet with Various Shell Liner Configurations,2019-04-01,2019,article,"The structure of the skull reveals that the cranial is made up of a number of bones. These bones, except the temporomandibular joint, are joined by sutures. The adjacent bones are strongly united by a matrix of connective tissues consisting of bundles of strong collagenous fibres connecting periosteum to the bones. The little movement at the sutures contributes to the elasticity and compliance of the cranial. This composition serves as a shock absorber and distributes impact force evenly around the skull. Frequent head impacts by footballers cause concussion which leads to brain and neurological disorders such as; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), dementia, depression, and a loss of attention span. These disorders are primarily caused by shock waves following impact, which moves from the front to the back of the brain. As such, the effort is geared at reducing head injuries from concussion by optimising helmet design through shock absorption increase and stress amplification reduction during impact. In this paper, the suture structure is mimicked in the design of a football helmet. A fibre-reinforced composite liner is introduced in the shell of the helmet. The liner runs from the front to the back of the helmet and bisects the shell into two equal parts. Hyperelastic material model is employed in the modelling of the composite liner while the polycarbonate helmet shell is modelled as a nonlinear elastoplastic material. A finite element model based on realistic geometric features of a football helmet was carried out, and an explicit finite element code LS-DYNA® is employed to simulate dynamic responses at different impact velocities of the helmet. The simulation was repeated for various compositions of the composite liner. Impact loads are applied on one side of the helmet shell while the responses are taken on the other side of the shell body of the helmet. To establish the validity of the model, the liner, and the shell materials are made to be the same. The results revealed that the responses of the helmet during impact are the same when the two components are of the same material compared with when there is no liner on the helmet shell. It was also shown that the dynamic response curve of the helmet emanating from different impacting conditions is judged by the maximum principal stress, Von Mises stress, and acceleration monitored within the impact period. The helmet composition with a sinusoidal liner form on the shell absorbed more impact load than other liner configurations."
https://openalex.org/W2938702267,4 Pre-season hip/groin strength and ratings of health are associated with prospective injury in professional footballers,2019-04-01,2019,article,"<h3>Background</h3> Hip and groin injuries are a significant cause of time lost from training and competition in elite football. <h3>Purpose</h3> To explore the association between hip/groin injury in professional footballers and pre-season assessment of 1) hip adductor and abductor strength, and 2) the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). <h3>Study Design</h3> Prospective cohort. <h3>Methods</h3> In total, n=204 elite male footballers from ten professional clubs underwent assessments of hip adductor and abductor strength and completed the HAGOS in pre-season. In-season hip/groin injuries were assessed and reported by team medical staff. Data reduction was conducted using principal component analysis. The subsequent factor component for HAGOS, and three factor components for strength and imbalance measures, were entered with age into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine their association with prospectively occurring hip/groin injury. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-four players suffered at least one hip/groin injury throughout the 2017–18 competitive season. The principal component for between-limb abduction imbalance (peak strength in the preferred [kicking] limb – non-preferred limb) (OR&amp;equals;0.61, 95% CI&amp;equals;0.40 to 0.92), and the principal component for HAGOS (OR&amp;equals;0.80, 95% CI&amp;equals;0.64 to 0.99) were independently associated with a reduced risk'of future hip/groin injury. Receiver operator curve analysis of the whole model revealed an area under the curve of 0.76. <h3>Conclusion</h3> These data demonstrate that a lower likelihood of prospective hip/groin injury during the season was associated with a hip abduction imbalance that favoured the preferred kicking limb and higher HAGOS obtained at pre-season."

https://openalex.org/W2947962499,A comparative study between transtibial and anatomical arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction of knee,2019-04-01,2019,article,"Introduction: Knee injuries are very common due to sports and repetitious activities. Of these ACL injuries are the most common. Surgical treatment with ACL reconstruction has now become gold standard in management of ACL injury. The main aim in anterior cruciate ligament surgery is to reproduce the normal kinematics of the knee and provide stability in the sagittal and coronal plane. There is better patient satisfaction associated with better stability and kinematics. The objective of our study is to compare the results of outcome following ACL reconstruction using the transtibial and the anatomical technique or femoral tunnel placement. Results: Out of 50 cases 38 were males 12 were females. Right knee was commonly involved compared to left accounting for 52% cases. Young patients between 17 and 35 years constituted the maximum number who suffered from ACL injuries. 60% of cases were due to motor vehicular accidents (MVA). Post injury there was an average fall of 50% in activity levels as compared to pre injury levels in both the groups. The patients in anatomical group attained 86.36% of pre injury activity level on an average, while those in transtibial group achieved 63.87%, a difference of 25.56%. There was a difference of a significant 19.40% in both group Lysholm Tegner Knee score with anatomical group having 90.92% and transtibial having 73.28% of score. Interpretation and conclusion: The anatomical ACL reconstruction group performed better in subjective outcome of Lysholm Tegner Knee Score as well as in achieving greater percentage of pre injury activity level as compared to the transtibial group of ACL reconstruction. Hence anatomical placement of femoral tunnel using anteromedial accessory portal is a better surgical option when compared to transtibial femoral tunnel placement in ACL reconstruction surgeries to achieve a more near normal knee kinematics."

However, studies using these systems are restricted to laboratory settings for technical reasons, which may lead to findings that are not representative of real-life context. Recently developed commercial and home-made inertial measurement sensors (M/IMU) are potentially good alternatives to the laboratory-based systems, and recent technology improvements required a synthesis of the current evidence. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the criterion validity and reliability of M/IMU for each body joint and for tasks of different levels of complexity. Five different databases were screened (Pubmed, Cinhal, Embase, Ergonomic abstract, and Compendex). Two evaluators performed independent selection, quality assessment (consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments [COSMIN] and quality appraisal tools), and data extraction. Forty-two studies were included. Reported validity varied according to task complexity (higher validity for simple tasks) and the joint evaluated (better validity for lower limb joints). More studies on reliability are needed to make stronger conclusions, as the number of studies addressing this psychometric property was limited. M/IMU should be considered as a valid tool to assess whole body range of motion, but further studies are needed to standardize technical procedures to obtain more accurate data."

The researchers used pendulum catapult to launch a soccer ball from 8.5 meters at the participant. Ten female active NCAA division 1 soccer players received one of three cues, or no cue, and then had five trials to control the ball onto an artificial turf mat to score 1-3 points depending on where the ball landed. Participants completed a manipulation check survey to ascertain the efficacy of the coaching cues. A motion capture system was used to quantify the movement and processed through Visual3D software for the joint angles during 10 frames before and after ball contact. A repeated-measures ANOVA found no significant difference in any of the kinematic variables nor the performance measures between the different cuing conditions, although there were trends within the performance data indicating a higher performance in the holistic cuing condition (mean(sd): .68 (.40)) compared to no cue condition (mean(sd): .28 (.25)). The means of the survey questions indicated strong compliance with the instructions. Given the novelty and exploratory nature of the study, the researchers concluded that the time interval analyzed was insufficient to reveal how the different coaching cues influenced the movement performance. Further analysis is required to assess different kinematic variables and time intervals within the movement."

We consider the manner in which physical, social and temporal factors combine to create a complex and dynamic coaching environment. Within this environment, the adventure sports coach (ASC) must contend with an array of difficult decisions with serious consequences. This environment compels the ASC to continually compare, contrast, prioritise and evaluate information. Such cognitive processes are conducive to a conceptualisation of knowledge synonymous with a sophisticated epistemology. We explore this position from three theoretical perspectives: personal epistemology, pedagogy and ecological psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2925806382,Sex Differences in Common Sports-Related Injuries,2019-03-28,2019,article,"Sex plays a role in mediating different susceptibilities and outcomes of disease and injury. Sports injuries are included in this phenomenon, as recent research demonstrates that males and females show differences in incidences of varying injuries, presentations of injury, and treatment outcomes. Incidence of certain sports injuries like anterior cruciate ligament injury or patellofemoral pain syndrome may vary widely between male and female athletes, with female athletes being more susceptible to anterior cruciate ligament injury and patellofemoral pain syndrome. Treatment outcomes for males and females may also vary widely. For example, males have a higher risk of recurrent shoulder instability compared with females. These variances among incidence and outcome following certain injuries highlight the necessity of understanding these differences to provide quality care. It is especially important for the school nurse to be aware of these sex differences as they are well positioned to make youth athletes and their families aware of the varying injury susceptibilities among them."

Seventeen Division-I collegiate soccer players were recruited. Two data collection sessions were conducted. The first data collection occurred prior to the start of the soccer season. Each subject completed a brief questionnaire, had height and weight measured, underwent a clinical assessment of their anterior cruciate ligaments and an eight sequence magnetic resonance imagery of their knees. Contours of the anterior cruciate ligaments were outlined in sagittal T-2 weighted MR images and volumes were calculated using Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization software. Presence or absence of edema within the ligament was determined in pre and post season scans. All subjects were followed during the season to determine if a lower extremity injury had been sustained. Mean ligament volume significantly increased from preseason to postseason (p=.006). There was a 10% increase in the percentage of knees with edema pre to post season. The physical demand of a competitive soccer season in female collegiate athletes appears to cause an increase in volume of the anterior cruciate ligament. The increase in volume may be related to the accumulation of microscopic tears over the course of the season which induce inflammation and edema. The volumetric changes in the ligament may have significant clinical implications, however further studies must be done to determine the relationship between anterior cruciate ligament volume and risk of injury."

Methods: Twenty-seven professional rugby union players performed CMJ, single-leg balance and landing tests on a 1000 Hz force plate at the beginning and end of training days. Training load was described by session RPE, Banister's TRIMP, GPS total distance, high-speed running distance (>5.5 m s−1), relative speed and body load. Results: CMJ eccentric rate of force development (EccRFD) demonstrated moderate impairment post-training (ES ± 90%CL = −0.79 ± 0.29, MBI = almost certainly). CMJ height (−0.21 ± 0.16, possible), concentric impulse (ConIMP) (−0.35 ± 0.17, likely) and single-leg balance sway velocity on the non-dominant leg (0.30 ± 0.26, possible) were also impaired. Regression analyses identified the strongest relationship between sRPE and impaired ConIMP (r = −0.68 ± 21, β = −0.68) whilst other load measures explained 27–50% of the variance in balance and CMJ changes. Conclusions: CMJ variables representing altered movement strategy (EccRFD and IMP) may be useful for assessing acute neuromuscular fatigue in rugby union, though single-leg balance sway velocity may be an alternative when maximal tests are impractical."

The majority of TBIs in older adults are sustained when the head impacts the ground or other surface during a fall. While several non-modifiable risk factors have been identified for fall-related TBIs in older adults, there still remains a dearth of knowledge surrounding modifiable risk factors. Thus, this significant knowledge gap warrants an investigation into research across disciplines. The sports medicine literature has examined several modifiable risk factors to prevent a mild form of TBI known as concussion. While this research has identified several risk factors, one particular risk factor may have potential implications to fall-related TBIs in older adults. The sports medicine literature has shown that decreased neck strength and slower neck muscle activation are significant predictors for sports-related concussion. Similarly, older adults experience age-related declines to neck muscle strength and muscle activation. Consequently, these age-related declines to the neck musculature may result in the inability of older adults to control their head during a fall, which results in greater impact forces being transmitted to the brain and increases the risk of TBI. This perspective article assesses the sports medicine literature related to the implications of neck strength and muscle activation in sports-related concussion, discusses age-related declines to neck strength and muscle activation, and highlights the potential impact of the neck musculature on fall-related TBIs in older adults."

Reaching movements were generated while standing and were performed either in isolation or in conjunction with a secondary reaction time (RT) task. In addition, to better understand how online movement control is affected by this interaction, the reaching movements could be unexpectedly perturbed medial-laterally. Postural kinetic, arm kinematic and RT, and secondary RT measures were used to characterize the responses. Results indicate task performance worsened when both the reaching and secondary tasks were completed simultaneously. Our results imply the generation of reaching movements while standing requires attentional resources to properly coordinate the interaction between the reaching task and postural control."

Grounded in Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) and the Model of Stress and Athletic Injury, the aim of this four-wave prospective survey study was to investigate the relationships among basic psychological needs satisfaction and frustration, stress responses, and sports injury. Study variables, including basic psychological need satisfaction/frustration, and perceived stress, were measured using a survey from 112 university athletes at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months of the study. Sports injury was assessed using a self-report form at the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th months of study. Results of the Bayesian multilevel analysis showed that basic psychological need satisfaction negatively predicted sports injuries, whereas stress was a positive predictor. In addition, basic psychological need satisfaction had an indirect effect on injury occurrence via stress. However, basic psychological need frustration did not predict sports injury. BPNT is a viable model to provide additional explanations to psychological risk factors of injury. Intervention programs may be formulated based on the evidence obtained on the model."

Joint-based EUR can also be calculated but have never been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether jump height-based (JH-based) EUR can be predicted by joint-specific EUR. Nine NCAA Division I college athletes (age: 21 ± 1 year, height: 1.75 ± 0.15 m, mass: 71 ± 20 kg) performed three SJ and CMJ. During all jumps, kinematic and kinetic data were obtained and used to calculate hip, knee and ankle net joint moments (NJM) and net joint powers (NJP). JH was calculated from pelvis marker data. EUR (CMJ/SJ [unitless]) were calculated for JH, NJM, and NJP. JH-EUR was 1.11 ± 0.70. NJM-EUR were 1.07 ± 0.17, 1.17 ± 0.25, and 1.07 ± 0.18 for the hip, knee and ankle joint, respectively. NJP-EUR were 1.41 ± 0.12, 1.26 ± 0.28 and 1.06 ± 0.11 for the hip, knee and ankle joint, respectively. Regularised regression showed that Hip-NJM-EUR, Knee-NJP-EUR and Ankle-NJM-EUR were able to predict 83% of the variance in JH-EUR, which suggests that the enhancement of lower-extremity SSC performance during CMJ arises from a combination of these parameters."

However, the high cost and non-portable nature of most instruments employed for muscle strength assessment frequently hamper an affordable evaluation in field conditions. This study evaluated the validity and reliability of a low-cost digital dynamometer to assess the maximal isometric strength of upper limb muscles. Fourteen physically active volunteers performed the main movements of the upper limb at maximal isometric strength: flexion-extension, internal-external rotation and abduction-adduction of the shoulder; and flexion-extension of both elbow and wrist. Validity was examined by comparing the strength values from the low-cost digital dynamometer and those measured by an isokinetic dynamometer, assumed as the gold standard. The correlation between both devices was perfect (r > 0.913), while Bland-Altman plots showed absolute agreement between both devices, the maximum range of the values of bias was −0.99–1.00 N in wrist extension. Inter-tester and intra-tester reliability were excellent for all movements (ICC ≥ 0.855). The low-cost digital dynamometer showed strong validity and excellent reliability in assessing maximal isometric strength during the main movements of the upper limb. Professionals may use it for an affordable isometric muscle strength assessment in field situations."

Twelve soccer players (9 males/3 females; 22.6 ± 2.3 y) participated in this study. Mechanical impact testing of each 3G surface; without (3G-NCU) and with cushioning underlay (3G-CU) were conducted. Impact force characteristics, joint kinematics and joint kinetics variables were calculated on each surface condition during a sprint 90° cut (90CUT), a sprint 180° cut (180CUT), a drop jump (DROP) and a sprint with quick deceleration (STOP). For all tasks, greater peak resultant force, peak knee extensor moment and peak ankle dorsi-flexion moment were found in 3G-NCU than 3G-CU (p < 0.05). During 90CUT and STOP, loading rates were higher in 3G-NCU than 3G-CU (p < 0.05). During 180CUT, higher hip, knee and ankle ranges of motion were found in 3G-NCU (p < 0.05). These findings showed that the inclusion of cushioning underlay in 3G reduces impact loading forces and lower limb joint loading in soccer players across game-specific tasks. Overall, players were not attempting to reduce higher lower limb impact loading associated with a lack of surface cushioning underlay."

A total of 378 head/neck injuries were recorded, and 189 (50.0%) injuries from this sample, resulted in a concussion diagnosis. Odds of concussion diagnosis were 84% higher among female players compared with their male counterparts, and over two-fold higher in game settings compared with practice settings. We also observed several significant symptom dependencies, such as higher odds of difficulty concentrating (OR = 5.84, 95% CI = [2.99, 11.42]) given concurrent light sensitivity. Furthermore, we identified injury mechanism as a determinant of concussion symptom resolution time.

We generate the labeling of instantaneous captures of the cloud of points, discarding temporal correlations, in the presence of occlusions. Our approach proposes an ensemble of weak classifiers defined over geometrical features extracted from small subsets of the cloud of points. We apply an Adaboost strategy to select a minimal ensemble of weak classifiers achieving a target correct labeling detection accuracy. Furthermore, we use these features to generate the labeling of the points in the cloud even in the presence of occlusions.To deal with the occlusions of markers we search for ensembles of partial labeling solvers which can provide partial consistent labelings which cover the unoccluded markers. We test two greedy search approaches and a genetic algorithm in the search for the optimal ensemble of partial solvers We demonstrate the approach on a real dataset obtained from the measurement of gait motion of persons, with available ground truth labeling. Results are encouraging, achieving high accuracy label generation at a reduced computational cost."

This enabled us to achieve a mean reduction of RTs for athletes eye-hand coordination of more than 10%, with high statistical significance. We explain how such an observed effect of Sensorimotor systems’ plasticity causing reduced RT can last in practice for multiple days and even weeks in subjects, via a proof of principle. Its mathematical neural model can be forced outside a previous stable (but long) RT into a state leading to reduced eye-hand coordination RT, which is, again, in a stable neural state."

The aims of the current study were to develop a reliable soccer-specific powerful action (SSPA) notational analysis coding system that could be used to compare frequency and durations of powerful actions during elite youth soccer match play.Sixteen elite male English Premier League (EPL) Academy players (19 ± 1 yrs) were recorded by an individual camera during 16 competitive EPL U18 and U21 games. Video footage was analyzed using performance analysis software and SSPAs were coded according to the following categories: initial acceleration, leading acceleration, sprint, unilateral jump and bilateral jump.The SSPA coding system demonstrated very good inter- and intra-rater reliability (kappa coefficients ≥ 0.827). Elite youth EPL soccer players undertook significantly more initial (31 ± 9) and leading (37 ± 12) accelerations than sprints (8 ± 3; p = .014, d = 1.7, and p < .001, d = 1.7, respectively) and jumps (6 ± 5; p = .002, d = 1.7 and p < .001, d = 1.7, respectively). Players performed a significantly greater number of initial and leading accelerations with action durations below 1.5 s compared to above 1.5 s (p = .001, d = 1.6, and p = .002, d = 1.4), respectively.Our SSPA coding system provides a reliable observational instrument for quantifying the frequency and duration of powerful actions performed during elite soccer match play. In our sample of elite youth soccer players, horizontal accelerations of short duration (< 1.5 s) from different starting speeds appear the most dominant powerful action in elite youth soccer match play."

The focus of the paper is to show that wearable sensor is more efficient than cameras in measuring sport performance and thereby video data and video based systems can be replaced by wearable sensors. Here, the current state-of-the art in BSNs are mainly introduced relating to sports performance instead of physical activity and health/safety related issues for sports and to the best of our knowledge, this has not been done yet for different types of sports rather than a particular sport. Although the progress in BSN for sports performance is in early stage, the ultimate goal is to develop a complete training/match analysis tool using wearable sensors and various analyses techniques to monitor as well as improve performances in sports."

The aim of this study is to evaluate a new instrumentation approach and collect some of the first head impact exposure data for youth female soccer players. Athletes were instrumented with custom-fit mouthpieces that measure head impacts. Detailed video analysis was conducted to identify characteristics describing impact source (e.g., kick, header, throw). A total of 763 verified head impacts were collected over 23 practices and 8 games from 7 athletes. The median peak linear accelerations, rotational velocities, and rotational accelerations of all impacts were 9.4 g, 4.1 rad/s, and 689 rad/s2, respectively. Pairwise comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in kinematics by impact source. Headers following a kicked ball had the highest accelerations and velocity when compared to headers from thrown or another header."

In recent years, SRC has received a significant amount of attention due to potential for long-term neurologic sequelae. However, the acute symptoms and possibility of prolonged recovery account for the vast majority of morbidity from SRC. Modifying factors have been identified and may allow for improved prediction of a protracted course. Potential novel modifying factors may include genetic determinants of recovery, as well as radiographic biomarkers, which represent burgeoning subfields in SRC research. Helmet design and understanding the biomechanical stressors on the brain that lead to concussion also represent active areas of research. This narrative review provides a general synopsis of SRC, including relevant definitions, current treatment paradigms, and modifying factors for recovery, in addition to novel areas of research and future directions for SRC research."

Insects recovered were wet preserved in 70% ethanol except butterflies and moths. A total of 4,501 insects spread across 9 orders, 34 families and 77 species were recovered. The most dominant order was Coleoptera with a relative abundance of (44.41%) and, the least was Orthoptera (0.84%). The most dominant insect species are Heteronychus mossambicus (11.44%) followed by Termes sp. (7.77%) and, Goryphus sp. (7.71%). Chlaenius decipiens, Cheilomenes sulphurea, Copris sp., Cicindela sp., Pseudantheraea sp., Derobranchus geminatus, Glaurocara townsendi, Camponotus perrisi, and Gryllus bimaculatus were the rare species with relative abundance of 0.02%. Species richness is based on number of individual insects measured. The highest species diversity was observed in the order Coleoptera (Shannon H’ =2.547) while, Isoptera was the least (H’ = 0.00). However, the highest species evenness was observed in the order Isoptera (E’ = 1.00). Fisher-alpha (α) index of diversity shows that the agro ecosystem has the highest index of diversity (α = 14.24) while, the residential area had the least (α = 11.9). This study therefore, brings to the fore the diversity and abundance of insects in Wukari and underscores the need for a more intensive study and for sustainable actions to be taken in conserving beneficial rare species while, managing the abundant pestiferous ones."

There is uncertainty about whether the effects of brain training transfer to real-world cognition, or performance on other cognitive assessment tests, or is specific only to the brain training app. Executive functions (EF’s) are higher-order cognitive processes important for activities of everyday living and autonomous goal-directed behaviour [1]. EF’s are associated with frontal brain networks that are susceptible to injury after head trauma and concussion so it is important to know whether these functions can be trained after a short training period (transfer effects beyond gains on app play), to general cognitive ability but findings so far have been mixed. The present study investigated efficacy of brief computerised brain training to in producing far-transfer effects to performance on standardised clinical tests of cognition in young rugby players with mixed concussion history, over a 4-week period. Athletes cognitive ability was assessed at baseline and after the training period on standardised tests to establish whether there were transfer effects. The putative relationship between concussion frequency and severity on baseline cognitive performance was also investigated. Results showed effective transfer effects from initial training to selective visuospatial executive functions. There was also a decline over the training period in non-verbal strategy initiation, although ability remained at average levels. Players showed no cognitive deficits at baseline, but correlational analyses and MR results indicated that concussion frequency, not severity, was a significant predictor of some visuospatial executive function scores at baseline. These preliminary findings hold promise for full scale studies investigating efficacy of brief brain training and association between sport-related concussion and cognition."

The purpose was to analyze and compare the predictive ability of a range of machine learning techniques to select the best performing injury risk factor model to identify professional soccer players at high risk of HSIs. A total of 96 male professional soccer players underwent a pre-season screening evaluation that included a large number of individual, psychological and neuromuscular measurements. Injury surveillance was prospectively employed to capture all the HSI occurring in the 2013/2014 season. There were 18 HSIs. Injury distribution was 55.6% dominant leg and 44.4% non-dominant leg. The model generated by the SmooteBoostM1 technique with a cost-sensitive ADTree as the base classifier reported the best evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score=0.837, true positive rate=77.8%, true negative rate=83.8%) and hence was considered the best for predicting HSI. The prediction model showed moderate to high accuracy for identifying professional soccer players at risk of HSI during pre-season screenings. Therefore, the model developed might help coaches, physical trainers and medical practitioners in the decision-making process for injury prevention."

The BTrackS Balance Test (BBT) is a tool for concussion balance testing that uses low-cost force-plate technology to objectively measure postural sway. Objective To provide normative data for the BBT in a large population of athletes. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Concussion baseline testing at multiple facilities. Patients or Other Participants Male and female athletes (n = 10 045) ages 8 to 21 years. Intervention(s) Athletes performed three 20-second trials of eyes-closed standing on the BTrackS Balance Plate with feet shoulder-width apart and hands on hips. Main Outcome Measure(s) Postural sway was measured as the average total center-of-pressure path length over 3 testing trials. Results Postural sway was reduced (ie, balance improved) as athlete age increased and was less in female athletes than in male athletes. Percentile ranking tables were calculated based on sex and 2-year age groupings. Conclusions Our findings (1) provide context for BBT results performed in the absence of a baseline test, (2) can help mitigate athlete malingering, and (3) might identify individuals with latent neuromuscular injuries during baseline tests."

The current standards for bone are based upon areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and an adaptation of aBMD cut-points for fragility fractures. Task Group members recommended (i) a minimum permissible outcome limit (POL) for post-mission hip bone load capacity, (ii) use of FE hip load capacity to further screen applicants to astronaut corps, (iii) a minimum pre-flight standard for a second long-duration mission, and (iv) a method for assessing which post-mission physical activities might increase an astronaut’s risk for fracture after return. QCT-FE models of eight astronaut were analyzed using nonlinear single-limb stance (NLS) and posterolateral fall (NLF) loading configurations. QCT data from the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) Reykjavik cohort and the Rochester Epidemiology Project were analyzed using identical modeling procedures. The 75 th percentile of NLS hip load capacity for fractured elderly males of the AGES cohort (9537N) was selected as a post-mission POL. The NLF model, in combination with a Probabilistic Risk Assessment tool, was used to assess the likelihood of exceeding the hip load capacity during post-flight activities. There was no recommendation to replace the current DXA-based standards. However, FE estimation of hip load capacity appeared more meaningful for younger, physically active astronauts and was recommended to supplement aBMD cut-points."

The anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL), the primary restraint to valgus stress, is commonly injured from throwing. Historically, such injuries have been treated with surgical reconstruction techniques, using a tendon autograft. A recently developed UCL repair procedure with an internal brace, utilizing collagen tape, is gaining popularity. The primary goal of this surgery is to enhance elbow joint stability while the ligament is healing and to allow earlier return to sport after UCL reconstruction. The rehabilitation program following UCL repair with internal brace progresses through a different time frame than after UCL reconstruction. The purpose of this commentary, based on our experience with more than 350 cases, including 79 patients with at least a 1-year postsurgical follow-up, was to describe and provide the rationale for the rehabilitation process following UCL repair with internal brace.

Core stability (or core strengthening) has become a well-known fitness trend that has started transcending into sports medicine. It has become a common practice to incorporate balance tasks into the training program for athletes who want to improve performance and prevent injuries. Hypothesis. We suggest that core stabilization and balance training with closed eyes will be more effective than training with open eyes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of core stabilization training with open eyes versus closed eyes on balance and stability of young football players. Methods. Fourteen healthy young football players aged 10–12 years were assessed for pre and post core stabilization training using two balance tests: Stork Balance Test (SBT) and Modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT), and one test for core stability ‒ McGill Core Stability Test (MCST). The intervention included twelve twenty-minute training sessions each of them involved six core strengthening exercises. One group performed exercises with open eyes, and another with eyes closed. Results. Core stability exercises with eyes closed as well as the same exercise done with eyes open insignificantly improved dynamic balance and core stability, but significantly improved the static balance of the subjects. Conclusion. After applying training with closed eyes as well as eyes open, core stability and balance of young football players increased insignificantly. There were no significant differences in core stability and balance training between training with eyes open and eyes closed.Keywords: core stabilization training, balance, open eyes, closed eyes."
https://openalex.org/W4252754315,Introduction,2019-03-13,2019,book-chapter,"Concussions are a specific type of athletic injury that have become recognized as a serious injury in a variety of sports. Documentaries and films such as Concussion, which depicted Dr. Bennett Omalu's discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among deceased former professional football athletes, along with increased media coverage of high-profile athletes with severe concussions, have also increased the public's awareness of this injury. A concussion is defined as a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that results from biomechanical forces transmitted via a direct or indirect blow to the face, head, or elsewhere on the body. On the spectrum of TBI, concussions are considered ""mild"" because they are closed head injuries that are typically not life-threatening. The majority of sport-related concussions occur as a result of participating in contact or collision sports like American football, rugby, and ice hockey. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book."

We investigated the hypothesis that coronal and horizontal rotations produce motion of the falx cerebri that damages the corpus callosum. We analyzed previously published head kinematics of 115 sports impacts (2 diagnosed mTBI) measured with instrumented mouthguards and used finite element (FE) simulations to correlate falx displacement with corpus callosum deformation. Peak coronal accelerations were larger in impacts with mTBI (8592 rad/s2 avg.) than those without (1412 rad/s2 avg.). From FE simulations, coronal acceleration was strongly correlated with deep lateral motion of the falx center (r = 0.85), while horizontal acceleration was correlated with deep lateral motion of the falx periphery (r > 0.78). Larger lateral displacement at the falx center and periphery was correlated with higher tract-oriented strains in the corpus callosum body (r = 0.91) and genu/splenium (r > 0.72), respectively. The relationship between the corpus callosum and falx was unique: removing the falx from the FE model halved peak strains in the corpus callosum from 35% to 17%. Consistent with model results, we found indications of corpus callosum trauma in diffusion tensor imaging of the mTBI athletes. For a measured alteration of consciousness, depressed fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity indicated possible damage to the mid-posterior corpus callosum. Our results suggest that the corpus callosum may be sensitive to coronal and horizontal rotations because they drive lateral motion of a relatively stiff membrane, the falx, in the direction of commissural fibers below."
https://openalex.org/W2920971205,A Review of Impact Testing Methods for Headgear in Sports: Considerations for Improved Prevention of Head Injury Through Research and Standards,2019-03-12,2019,review,"Standards for sports headgear were introduced as far back as the 1960s and many have remained substantially unchanged to present day. Since this time, headgear has virtually eliminated catastrophic head injuries such as skull fractures and changed the landscape of head injuries in sports. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is now a prevalent concern and the effectiveness of headgear in mitigating mTBI is inconclusive for most sports. Given that most current headgear standards are confined to attenuating linear head mechanics and recent brain injury studies have underscored the importance of angular mechanics in the genesis of mTBI, new or expanded standards are needed to foster headgear development and assess headgear performance that addresses all types of sport-related head and brain injuries. The aim of this review is to provide a basis for developing new sports headgear impact tests for standards by summarizing and critiquing: 1) impact testing procedures currently codified in published headgear standards for sports and 2) new or proposed headgear impact test procedures in published literature and/or relevant conferences. Research areas identified as needing further knowledge to support standards test development include defining sports-specific head impact conditions, establishing injury and age appropriate headgear assessment criteria, and the development of headgear specific head and neck surrogates for at-risk populations."

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of soccer heading on cognitive functioning in active professional soccer players. Male soccer players (n = 44), from two soccer teams that play in the Brazilian A Series Championship, and non-athletes (n = 47), comparable in age and education, were submitted to cognitive assessment, consisting of computerized and conventional neuropsychological testing (Neupsilin battery). In the computerized cognitive assessment, soccer players performed better than controls on reaction time measures in general motor coordination, executive functioning and memory tests, and on accuracy measures in executive functioning tests. There were no significant differences between groups on the Neupsilin battery. A comparison between two sub-groups of soccer players, based on the self-reported number of headings, did not show significant differences on tests performance. No significant correlations were found between an estimate of exposure to heading during professional soccer career and cognitive performance. Our data demonstrate no evidence of cognitive impairment in soccer players, compared to non-athletes, and no association between heading exposure and performance on neuropsychological tests. Longitudinal investigations, including neuroimaging assessment, will help to clarify whether soccer heading may be associated with brain injury and cognitive dysfunction."

Although cognitive load effects on gait patterns are well known, little is known on how it affects biomechanics of turning gait among athletes. Such information could help evaluate how concussion affects turning gait required for daily living and sports. Objective : To determine the effect of a dual task on biomechanics of turning while walking among college athletes. Design : Cross-sectional study. Setting : University laboratory. Participants : Fifty-three participants performed 5 trials of a 20-m walk under single- and dual-task conditions at self-selected speed with a 180° turn at 10-m mark. The cognitive load included subtraction, spelling words backward, or reciting the months backward. Interventions : Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures : Turn duration, turning velocity, number of steps, SD of turn duration and velocity, and coefficient of variation of turn duration and velocity. Results : Participants turned significantly slower (155.99 [3.71] cm/s vs 183.52 [4.17] cm/s; P &lt; .001) and took longer time to complete the turn (2.63 [0.05] s vs 2.33 [0.04] s; P &lt; .001) while dual tasking, albeit taking similar number of steps to complete the turn. Participants also showed more variability in turning time under the dual-task condition (SD of turn duration = 0.39 vs 0.31 s; P = .004). Conclusions : Overall, college athletes turned slower and showed more variability during turning gait while performing a concurrent cognitive dual-task turning compared with single-task turning. The slower velocity increased variability may be representative of specific strategy of turning gait while dual tasking, which may be a result of the split attention to perform the cognitive task. The current study provides descriptive values of absolute and variability turning gait parameters for sports medicine personnel to use while they perform their concussion assessments on their college athletes."

In this study parametric voice synthesis was employed to add pitch jumps, subharmonics/sidebands, and chaos to synthetic human nonverbal vocalizations. In Experiment 1 (86 participants, 144 sounds), chaos was associated with lower valence, and subharmonics with higher dominance. Arousal ratings were not noticeably affected by any nonlinear effects, except for a marginal effect of subharmonics. These findings were extended in Experiment 2 (83 participants, 212 sounds) using ratings on discrete emotions. Listeners associated pitch jumps, subharmonics, and especially chaos with aversive states such as fear and pain. The effects of manipulations in both experiments were particularly strong for ambiguous vocalizations, such as moans and gasps, and could not be explained by a non-specific measure of spectral noise (harmonics-to-noise ratio) – that is, they would be missed by a conventional acoustic analysis. In conclusion, listeners interpret nonlinear vocal phenomena quite flexibly, depending on their type and the kind of vocalization in which they occur. These results showcase the utility of parametric voice synthesis and highlight the need for a more fine-grained analysis of voice quality in acoustic research."

This study i) explored a novel analysis throughout the range of motion based on statistical parametric mapping and ii) examined the impact of sex and discipline on hamstrings/quadriceps torque in elite alpine skiers. Twenty-eight national team skiers (14 females, 14 males; 14 technical, 14 speed) undertook an isokinetic evaluation of the knee flexors/extensors (range 30–90°, 0° representing full extension). There was no effect of sex (p=0.864, d=0.03) and discipline (p=0.360, d=0.17) on maximal hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio and no effect of discipline on maximal torque (p&gt;0.156, d≤0.25). Hamstrings torque and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio were lower in females than males toward knee extension only (p&lt;0.05). Quadriceps torque was greater after 72° of knee flexion in technicians than downhill skiers (p&lt;0.05). The current data showed that statistical parametric mapping analysis identified angle-specific differences that could not be evidenced when analyzing only maximal torques and reconstructed ratios. This may enhance screening methods to identify pathologic knee function or monitor rehabilitation programs, and inform sex- and discipline-specific training in alpine skiing."

Both groups maintained their regular training, whereas CT attended 3 extra core training sessions per week for 8 weeks. The participants were assessed before and after the training program using sensory organization test (SOT), sport-specific endurance plank test (SEPT) and 4-stage treadmill incremental running test (TIRT).

In contrast to chronic muscle diseases such as dystrophy, sarcopenia, or cachexia, traumatic muscle injuries inflict damage to localized muscle groups. Although minor muscle trauma heals without severe consequences, no reliable clinical strategy exists to prevent excessive fibrosis or fatty degeneration, both of which occur after severe traumatic injury and contribute to muscle degeneration and dysfunction. Of the many proposed strategies, cell-based approaches have shown the most promising results in numerous pre-clinical studies and have demonstrated success in the handful of clinical trials performed so far. A number of myogenic and non-myogenic cell types benefit muscle healing, either by directly participating in new tissue formation or by stimulating the endogenous processes of muscle repair. These cell types operate via distinct modes of action, and they demonstrate varying levels of feasibility for muscle regeneration depending, to an extent, on the muscle injury model used. While in some models the injury naturally resolves over time, other models have been developed to recapitulate the peculiarities of real-life injuries and therefore mimic the structural and functional impairment observed in humans. Existing limitations of cell therapy approaches include issues related to autologous harvesting, expansion and sorting protocols, optimal dosage, and viability after transplantation. Several clinical trials have been performed to treat skeletal muscle injuries using myogenic progenitor cells or multipotent stromal cells, with promising outcomes. Recent improvements in our understanding of cell behaviour and the mechanistic basis for their modes of action have led to a new paradigm in cell therapies where physical, chemical, and signalling cues presented through biomaterials can instruct cells and enhance their regenerative capacity. Altogether, these studies and experiences provide a positive outlook on future opportunities towards innovative cell-based solutions for treating traumatic muscle injuries-a so far unmet clinical need."

When diagnosing and managing a concussion, a battery of tests from several domains (e.g., symptom reporting, neurocognitive, physiology) must be used. In this study, we propose and develop an objective, evidence-based protocol to assess the pathophysiology of the brain by using non-invasive methods.Contact sport athletes (n = 300) will be assessed at the beginning of the season in a healthy state to establish baseline values, and then prospectively followed if a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) occurs on approximately days 1-2, 3-5, 7-10, 21, 30, and subsequently thereafter, depending on the severity of injury. The protocol includes spontaneous measurements at rest, during head postural change, controlled breathing maneuvers for cerebrovascular reactivity, a neurovascular coupling stimuli, and a baroreflex/autoregulation maneuver. Physiological data collection will include cerebral blood flow velocity, cerebral oxygenation, respiratory gases for end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide, finger photoplethysmography for blood pressure, seismocardiography for cardiac mechanics, and electrocardiography. Conclusion, Limitations, and Ethics: The protocol will provide an objective, physiological evidence-based approach in an attempt to better diagnose concussion to aid in return-to-play or -learn. Ethics approval has been granted by the University Research Ethics Board."

To understand how helmets provide head protection, quantification of the relative motion between the head and the helmet is necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare helmet and head kinematics and quantify the relative motion of helmet with respect to head during experimental representations of on-field American football impact scenarios. Seven helmet-to-helmet impact configurations were simulated by propelling helmeted crash test dummies into each other. Head and helmet kinematics were measured with instrumentation and an optical motion capture system. The analysis of results, from 10 ms prior to the helmet contact to 20 ms after the loss of helmet contact, showed that the helmets translated 12-41 mm and rotated up to 37 deg with respect to the head. The peak resultant linear acceleration of the helmet was about 2-5 times higher than the head. The peak resultant angular velocity of the helmet ranged from 37% less to 71% more than the head, depending on the impact conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the kinematics of the head and the helmet are noticeably different and that the helmet rotates significantly with respect to the head during impacts. Therefore, capturing the helmet kinematics using a video motion tracking methodology is not sufficient to study the biomechanics of the head. Head motion must be measured independently of the helmet."
https://openalex.org/W2918720837,Kinematic effects of repeated turns while running,2019-03-05,2019,article,"Abstract In team sports, non‐contact ACL and MCL injuries occur during abrupt changes of direction, like turns or cutting manoeuvres. Fatigue affects dynamic neuromuscular control and increases knee injury risk. This study analysed how lower limb joints and centre‐of‐mass kinematics are affected throughout a high‐intensity running protocol involving repeated 180°‐turns. Twenty young men (18–23 years, BMI: 20.8–24.4 kg m −2 ) completed a 5‐m shuttle running trial lasting 5 min at an average speed of 75% of their maximum aerobic speed. During the test, cardio‐metabolic parameters were obtained, together with joints and centre‐of‐mass kinematics, using a motion capture system. Kinematic data were compared between the first and the last minute of exercise. Perceived exercise intensity ranged from “hard” to “maximum exertion” and post‐exercise lactate concentration ranged from 5.4 to 15.5 mM. The repetition of 180°‐turns induced a substantial reduction of hip (−60%, p &lt; .001, large effect) and knee flexion (−40%, p = .003, medium‐to‐large effect), and an increase of hip adduction and internal rotation (+25–30%, p &lt; .05, medium‐to‐large effect). Since such movements are factors increasing the likelihood of non‐contact knee injuries, we concluded that the prolonged repetition of turns may expose participants to increased risk of ligament failure. Prevention programmes should include discipline‐specific neuromuscular training especially in late practices."

Videos of concussive and non-concussive impacts in an elite professional ice hockey league in North America were reconstructed using physical and finite element model methods. Eighty concussive and 45 non-concussive events were studied. Logistic regressions indicate significant thresholds for concussion for linear/rotational acceleration and CSDM10%. Impacts in ice hockey were mostly long duration events, longer than 15 ms. These results have significant implications for helmet standards and development to prevent concussion."

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of training incorporating instructions promoting an internal versus external attentional focus on landing forces in adolescent rugby athletes. Twenty-two rugby athletes were randomly allocated to groups that received instructions promoting an internal versus an external focus during a two week training programme. Landing forces were recorded before and after completion of the programme. During follow-up testing, landings were performed with and without a secondary cognitive task. Both groups exhibited a similar reduction in landing forces following training for trials performed without the secondary cognitive task. However, the groups responded differently when the secondary cognitive task was imposed. Athletes who were trained with an internal focus demonstrated a prominent increase in landing forces for trials that included the secondary cognitive task (vs. trials performed without the secondary cognitive task), whereas the secondary cognitive task had minimal influence for athletes who were trained with an external focus. It appears that training with an external focus may promote adaptations in landing mechanics that can be implemented more automatically."

This study investigated the mechanism to avoid excessive pelvic obliquity during sidestep cutting. Ten physically active men performed sidestep cutting with maximal effort, and we captured the kinematics and kinetics with force platforms and an eight-camera motion capture system. Our results indicated that the stance hip exerted little abduction torque; however, lumbosacral lateral flexion torque was exerted towards the free-leg side (peak value: 3.39 ± 0.91 N m/kg). Although bilateral hip joint forces acted to drop the free-leg side of the pelvis, the net torque around pelvic elevation/drop axis was nearly zero during the entire stance phase and the change in the angular momentum around the pelvic elevation/drop axis from touchdown to toe-off was negligible (−0.004 ± 0.003 N m s/kg). The integrated components of lateral flexor for elevating the free-leg side of the pelvis (0.220 ± 0.072 N m s/kg) were significantly larger than any other integrated components, which were all negligible (<0.010 N m s/kg). Thus, sidestep cutting requires the lumbosacral lateral flexion torque exertion to neutralise the passive action that drops the free-leg side of the pelvis."

(1998) has been used in the study to determine the footballers&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; dominant foot preferences. The questionnaire was translated into Turkish by &amp;Ouml;zsu (2006). Musculoskeletal disorders observed in footballers have been determined by the Turkish version of the Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire. The questionnaire was translated into Turkish and made practicable for Turkish users by being tested by Erdinc and et al (2011). The data were evaluated with SPSS 22.0 package program in 95% confidence range and 0.05 significance level. With the statistical analysis done in the study, it has been determined that there has been no statistically significant difference between the footballers in terms of upper extremity injuries (p&amp;gt;0.05). When the injuries seen in lower extremities have been examined, it has been determined that there has been statistically significant difference in terms of injuries seen in left upper leg, left knee and left lower leg (p&amp;lt;0.05). Within the lights of the findings obtained in the study, it has been concluded that the dominant foot preferences of the footballers have not affected the injuries seen in upper extremity but they have affected the injuries seen in some regions of the lower extremity (left upper leg, left knee and left lower leg). In addition to the known preventive precautions to avoid injuries in young footballers, it can also be recommended to strengthen sufficiently not only the dominant foot but also the non-dominant one."

Patients who sustained a patellar fracture were identified. The clinical course for each patient was reviewed with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form scores through 2-year follow-up.The incidence of patellar fractures was 3.5% intraoperatively and 8.8% at 2 years. This included 2 intraoperative fractures, 1 fracture during strength testing, and 2 occult fractures detected on computed tomography (CT) performed 6 months postoperatively for research purposes in asymptomatic participants. For the 5 patients with a patellar fracture with 24-month follow-up, the IKDC scores were 91.95, 91.95, 100.00, 100.00, and 64.37.Careful consideration of the quadriceps tendon and patellar anatomy is needed to safely harvest the bone plug from the superior pole of the patella. The consequences of a quadriceps tendon autograft harvest, specifically with regard to the risks associated with fractures of the patella during the harvest, demand full consideration.

As such, while a number of recommendations regarding postoperative therapy have been published, no validated rehabilitation guidelines currently exist.To assess the variability of rehabilitation protocols utilized by orthopaedic residency programs in the United States (US) and those described in the scientific literature.Cross-sectional study.Online UCL reconstruction rehabilitation protocols from US orthopaedic programs and from the scientific literature were reviewed. A comprehensive scoring rubric was developed to assess each protocol for the presence of various rehabilitation components as well as the timing of their introduction.Overall, 22 protocols (14%) from 155 US Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) orthopaedic programs and 8 protocols published in the scientific literature detailing UCL reconstruction postoperative rehabilitation were identified and reviewed. After reconstruction, the majority of ERAS and review article protocols (77% and 88%, respectively) advised immediate splinting at 90° of elbow flexion. The mean time to splint discontinuation across all protocols was 2.0 weeks (range, 1-3 weeks). There was considerable variability in elbow range of motion recommendations; however, most protocols detailed goals for full extension and full flexion (>130°) at a mean 5.3 weeks (range, 4-6 weeks) and 5.5 weeks (range, 4-6 weeks), respectively. Significant diversity in the inclusion and timing of strengthening, proprioceptive, and throwing exercises was also apparent. Thirteen ERAS (59%) and 7 review article (88%) protocols specifically mentioned return to competition as an endpoint. ERAS protocols permitted return to competition significantly earlier than review article protocols (29.6 vs 39.0 weeks, respectively; P = .042).There is notable variability in both the composition and timing of rehabilitation components across a small number of protocols available online. While our understanding of postoperative rehabilitation for UCL reconstruction evolves, outcome-based studies focused on identifying clinically beneficial modalities and metrics are necessary to enable meaningful standardization."

It is currently unknown whether runners will adapt to decrease the impact force and loading rate over time. Purpose: To compare the vertical ground-reaction force and ankle kinematics between maximal and traditional shoes before and after a 6-week acclimation period to the maximal shoe. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Participants ran in a traditional running shoe and a maximal running shoe during 2 testing sessions 6 weeks apart. During each session, 3-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were collected during overground running. Variables of interest included the loading rate, impact peak, and active peak of the vertical ground-reaction force, as well as eversion and dorsiflexion kinematics. Two-way repeated measures analyses of variance compared data within participants. Results: No significant differences were observed in any biomechanical variable between time points. The loading rate and impact peak were higher in the maximal shoe. Runners were still everted at toe-off and landed with less dorsiflexion, on average, in the maximal shoe. Conclusion: Greater loading rates and impact forces were previously found in maximal running shoes, which may indicate an increased risk of injury. The eversion mechanics observed in the maximal shoes may also increase the risk of injury. A 6-week transition to maximal shoes did not significantly change any of these measures. Clinical Relevance: Maximal running shoes are becoming very popular and may be considered a treatment option for some injuries. The biomechanical results of this study do not support the use of maximal running shoes. However, the effect of these shoes on pain and injury rates is unknown."

With the newer generations of sand and rubber infill systems, the infill is a common component that varies between fields and is a critical factor that could influence the player-surface interaction. Because the influence of infill weight on sport trauma is unknown, this study quantified football trauma in high schools in the United States across artificial turf systems of various infill weights.Athletes would not experience differences in game-related injuries across artificial turf systems of various infill weights.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.Artificial turf systems were divided into 4 sand/rubber infill weight groups by pounds per square foot: ≥9.0, 6.0-8.9, 3.0-5.9, and 0.0-2.9. A total of 57 high schools in 4 states participated over the course of 5 seasons. Outcomes of interest included injury severity, as a function of infill weight, across head, knee, and shoulder traumas; injury category; primary type of injury; tissue type; specific body location of injury; cleat design; environmental factors; and turf age. Data were subject to multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and Wilks λ criteria through use of general linear model procedures.Of 1837 games documented, 528 games were played on infill weights of ≥9.0 lb/ft2, 521 on 6.0-8.9 lb/ft2, 525 on 3.0-5.9 lb/ft2, and 263 on 0.0-2.9 lb/ft2, with 4655 total injuries reported. MANOVAs indicated significant infill weight effects across injury severity (F2,4648 = 5.087; P = .0001), with significant main effects also observed by injury category, tissue injured, lower extremity joint and muscle, cleat design, environmental factors, and turf age. Post hoc analyses indicated significantly lower (P < .05 to .0001) total and substantial traumas, concussions, shoe-surface interaction during contact trauma, surface impacts, muscle-tendon overload, cleat design influence, adverse weather trauma, lower extremity injuries, and turf age effect while athletes were competing on the 6.0 to ≥9.0 lb/ft2 infill weight systems compared with the lighter infill weight systems.As infill surface weight decreased, football trauma significantly increased across numerous playing conditions. Based on findings, high school football fields should minimally contain 6.0 pounds of infill per square foot."
https://openalex.org/W2923616910,"Biomechanics of Blast TBI With Time-Resolved Consecutive Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Loads",2019-03-01,2019,article,"Abstract Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has become a signature casualty of recent military operations. In spite of significant clinical and preclinical TBI research, current understanding of injury mechanisms and short- and long-term outcomes is limited. Mathematical models of bTBI biomechanics may help in better understanding of injury mechanisms and in the development of improved neuroprotective strategies. Until present, bTBI has been analyzed as a single event of a blast pressure wave propagating through the brain. In many bTBI events, the loads on the body and the head are spatially and temporarily distributed, involving the primary intracranial pressure wave, followed by the head rotation and then by head impact on the ground. In such cases, the brain microstructures may experience time/space distributed (consecutive) damage and recovery events. The paper presents a novel multiscale simulation framework that couples the body/brain scale biomechanics with micro-scale mechanobiology to study the effects of micro-damage to neuro-axonal structures. Our results show that the micro-mechanical responses of neuro-axonal structures occur sequentially in time with “damage” and “relaxation” periods in different parts of the brain. A new integrated computational framework is described coupling the brain-scale biomechanics with micro-mechanical damage to axonal and synaptic structures."

This study aimed to investigate whether RF strain injury affected the region-specific functional role of the muscle. We studied seven soccer players with a history of unilateral RF strain injury. Injury data were obtained from a questionnaire survey and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multichannel surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals were recorded from the proximal to distal regions of the RF with 24 electrodes during isometric knee extension and hip flexion. The SEMG signals of each channel during hip flexion were normalised by those during knee extension for the injured and non-injured RF (HF/KE), and compared among the proximal, middle, and distal regions. Six RF strain injuries showed a low signal area in MRI. There was no significant difference in muscle strength between the injured and non-injured RF. While the HF/KE in the proximal region was significantly higher than those in the middle and distal regions in the non-injured RF, a difference in the HF/KE was seen only between the proximal and distal regions of the injured RF. Furthermore, the HF/KE of the most proximal channel in the injured RF was significantly lower than that in the non-injured RF. However, there was no significant difference between injured and non-injured areas in the HF/KE. Our findings suggest that the region-specific functional role of the RF muscle is partly affected by RF strain injury."

Methods One hundred and ninety-four elite athletes were divided into three groups according to the predominant type of exercise performed: endurance ( n = 40), strength-sprinter ( n = 36), and ball-game players ( n = 118). They performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill and were subjected to echocardiography. The rate of decline (HR recovery) was calculated as the difference between maximum and recovery HRs (HRrec1 and HRrec3). The HRI was calculated as HR max – 1-min post-exercise HR (HRrec1). Results The most significant correlation of HRI was with posterior wall diameter and left ventricular (LV) mass index ( r = 0.43 and r = 0.51; p = 0.012 and p = 0.003, respectively). LV mass index [Beta ( B ) = 0.354, p = 0.001] was an independent predictor of HRI and HRrec1. HRI may be an effective tool for discrimination of physiological and “gray zone” LV hypertrophy, with area under the curve of 0.545 (95% CI = 0.421–0.669, p = 0.0432). HRI displayed a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 52.2% at the optimal cut-off value of 23.5. Conclusion HR recovery pattern, especially HRI, may offer a timely and efficient tool to identify athletes with autonomous nervous system adaptive changes."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional link between mental representations in long-term memory and cognitive information processing ability in working memory by analyzing mental representation structure and cognitive performance according to skill level. Twenty male skilled and 25 male novice tennis players participated in this study. Structural dimensional analysis of mental representation was used to evaluate the mental representation structure of a tennis serve. In addition, cognition and movement chronometry was used to assess the cognitive performance of a tennis serve in working memory. Results of the representational analysis showed that the similarity of the skilled players to the standard representation structure was higher than that of novices. Furthermore, results in cognitive performance showed that the skilled players had a higher accuracy and shorter response time compared to the novices. Finally, a significant correlation between the adjusted Rand index and cognition movement chronometry accuracy was observed. Taken together, the mental representation structure and cognitive performance of the skilled players were superior to those of the novices, and mental representations were positively correlated with the accuracy of the cognitive information processing. These results imply that the degree of functional connection between working memory and long-term memory may be used as a perceptual-cognitive factor to explain improvement in performance."

Performing artist athletes are particularly at risk for injury given the load placed on the hallucal sesamoid bone often inherent in the activity. Risk factors may include choice of sport, volume of training, sex, bone density, BMI and biomechanical profile of the lower extremity. Hallucal sesamoid evaluation and treatment remains poorly defined in the literature. The aim of this study is to analyze all sesamoid injuries presenting to a sports medicine clinic. The goal of the study is to increase understanding of the injury profile, diagnostic evaluation, treatment regime, and return to sport of athletes with hallucal sesamoid injuries. The long-term goal is to develop evaluation and treatment algorithms that serve to guide clinical decision-making, and improve time to return to sport. Methods A comprehensive retrospective chart review was conducted of athletes presenting to a tertiary level sports medicine clinic located within a pediatric medical center. Electronic medical records were searched using the search term sesamoid. To be included in the study, the injury had to definitively involve the hallucal sesamoid and be related to sports participation. Exclusion criteria included patients with a chronic disease or condition that might affect bone healing or confuse the diagnosis of sesamoid injury, prior history of surgery to the foot, and insufficient management records. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze outcome variables including specific diagnosis, clinical prognoses, diagnostic imaging tools and treatment types. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed for time from pain onset to first clinic visit, and time to return to participation. Little or no correlation was considered 0.00-0.25, weak correlation was considered 0.25-0.50, moderate correlation was considered 0.50-0.75 and strong correlation was considered 0.75 -1.00. Results 326 athletes with 359 hallucal sesamoid injuries were identified. The mean age of the cohort was 15.8 ± 3.8 years (median: 15.3, 95% CIs: 15.46 – 16.24); 86% (n=309) were female and 14% (n=50) of the injuries were male. The mean BMI of the cohort was 21.28 ± 3.5 mg/kg2. Table 1 presents the sports for the athletes in the cohort. The leading sports included 40% (n=144) dance, 13% (n=48) running, and 13% (n=47) soccer. Activities that top the list for females include dance 44% (n=137) and running 13% (n=39). In comparison, male athletes participated in soccer (20%, n=10), running (18%, n=9), and football (10%, n=5) as well as other diverse sports. The most common injuries across both sexes were sesamoiditis (30%, n=107), followed by sesamoid stress fracture (13%, n=46). Table 2 Where self-reported data on dance/sport practice time was recorded, 31% (n=65) reported practicing 10-15 hours per week. Figure 1 The average reported time between injury or the onset of pain to the first clinic visit was 143 days (median: 42, 95% CIs:116.87-169.15). The mean time between pain onset and first clinic visit was greater for female athletes as compared to male athletes (146 days and 119 days). The average time from first presentation to clinic to returning to participation was 115 days (median: 72, CIs:100.7-129.49). Spearman’s rho demonstrated a strong correlation between time from pain onset to first clinic visit and the time to return to participation in both males (? (rho) = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001) and females (? = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001). Males experienced a shorter duration from the first clinic visit to return to participation (mean: 72 days, median 33), than females (mean: 121 days, median 77). The most common diagnostic imaging modalities used were radiographs (72.14%, n=259) and MRI (56.55%, n=203). In both males and females the most common initial treatments included a combination of: walking boot (51.53%, n= 185), physical therapy (38.72%, n=139), and activity modification (34.82%, n=125). These remained the most popularly prescribed treatments in the second and third treatments as well. Conclusions/significance Female athletes participating in dance and running, and male soccer, running and football athletes lead the list for injury to the hallucal sesamoid. Sesamoiditis and sesamoid stress fracture were the leading diagnoses in this cohort. Athletes who presented to clinical attention sooner also returned to sport/dance sooner when compared to athletes who delayed seeking medical attention. Continued research will serve to support anticipatory guidance and education surrounding hallucal sesamoid clinical presentation and need for timely evaluation and treatment in order to minimize time loss from sport/performing artist activity.

https://openalex.org/W2929338613,COMPARISON OF HEAD IMPACT BIOMECHANICS BETWEEN TACKLE AND FLAG YOUTH FOOTBALL,2019-03-01,2019,article,"Background: There is growing fear among healthcare professionals and parents regarding youth tackle football, likely due to highly publicized concerns about potential long-term physical and cognitive health of professional football players. Parents and advocacy groups are pushing for state legislation to ban youth tackle football in favor of flag football to avoid repetitive head impacts that are potentially associated with late-life cognitive deficits. Although the head impact burden experienced during flag football is likely lower than tackle, no research has compared head impact exposure between youth tackle and flag football. Therefore, our purpose was to examine head impact exposure and magnitudes between youth tackle and flag football players. Methods: Twenty-seven tackle (age=11.0±1.5y, height=145.8±11.9 cm, mass=45.0±14.9 kg) and 29 flag football players (age=8.6±1.1y, height=133.9±8.4 cm, mass=33.9±9.5 kg) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants were fitted with head impact sensors (Triax Sim-G) worn throughout the entire 2017 season that recorded impact frequency and magnitude (linear [g] and rotational acceleration [rad/s2]). Athlete exposure was defined as one player participating in one session. Impact rates (IR) were calculated as impacts per one athlete exposure. Game, practice, and combined IR were compared between groups using impact rate ratios (IRR). IRR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) not containing 1.0 were considered statistically significant. Acceleration values were binned into low- and high-magnitude categories (linear split at 40 g, rotational split at 4,600rad/s2). Magnitude category frequencies were compared between groups using Chi-square test of association (p&lt;0.05), and 90th percentile acceleration values are presented. Results: One-thousand nine-hundred and eight tackle (735 game, 1173 practice; 70.66 impacts/player) and 169 flag (101 game, 68 practice; 5.83 impacts/player) football head impacts were recorded. Tackle players experienced a higher impact rate during games versus practices (IRR=1.41; 95%CI:1.29 -1.55) while flag players experienced a lower impact rate (IRR=0.60; 95%CI:0.44-0.81). Practice and game head impacts combined resulted in tackle players (IR=3.06) accruing 4.61 times the impact rate (95%CI:3.94-5.40) of flag players (IR=0.66). Tackle players sustained a significantly greater head impact rate than flag players during games (tackle IR=3.83, flag IR=0.55; IRR=6.90; 95%CI:5.60-8.49) and practices (tackle IR=2.72, flag IR=0.93; IRR=2.91; 95%CI:2.28-3.72). Tackle 90th percentile linear acceleration was 53.32 g (median=32.50 g) and flag was 53.32 g (median=32.65 g). Tackle 90th percentile rotational acceleration was 7,000 rad/s2 (median=3,200rad/s2) while flag was 8,300 rad/s2 (median=4,100rad/s2). Tackle experienced a significantly higher frequency of low-magnitude rotational acceleration impacts (71.6% vs. 57.4%) and lower frequency of high-magnitude impacts than flag (28.4% vs 42.6%;?2=15.15, p&lt;0.001). There were no significant associations for linear acceleration (p=0.75). Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate youth flag football head impact rates are 82%-88% lower compared to tackle. Contrary to general belief, youth flag football players experienced numerous head impacts with a greater tendency for high-magnitude rotational acceleration head impacts. Although fewer head impacts occur during youth flag football, parents and coaches should be aware that head impacts do occur during practices and games. Whether high-magnitude or high-frequency head impacts influence long-term health remains unknown. Our findings provide novel evidence into the head impact exposure occurring during youth tackle and flag football. Longitudinal studies examining head impact biomechanics and advanced neuroimaging in youth tackle and flag football players nationwide is warranted to ensure long term cognitive health."
https://openalex.org/W2934453837,BIOMECHANIC DATA-DRIVEN BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TO REDUCE CONCUSSION RISK IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ATHLETES,2019-03-01,2019,article,"Background: Each year, between 1.1 and 1.9 million sports and recreation-related concussions occur annually in US children aged =18 years. Football has a high concussion incidence relative to other youth sports. This is particularly concerning given recent evidence suggesting sport-related concussions are associated with late-life cognitive and psychological dysfunction in former athletes. Unfortunately, there are currently few proven interventions to prevent concussion in football. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a mentored intervention program designed to teach safe play techniques and thereby reduce head impact frequency and severity in high school football players. Methods: In a clustered quasi-experimental study design, the player education intervention program was provided to two out of three teams in year one, two out of four teams in year two, and all four teams in year three. Head impacts were measured using in-helmet accelerometers worn by all players. Head impact data and game video were used to identify “high risk” players on intervention teams to receive individualized mentoring. Players were identified as candidates for intervention based on three criteria: 1) greater than 20% of head impacts sustained to the top of the head, 2) greater than 7% of impacts exceeded 60 g in peak linear acceleration, and 3) player sustained a concussion. High-risk players attended 3 individual or small-group education sessions over 3 weeks with a mentor who analyzed game film to teach safer playing techniques. Intervention effects were evaluated by comparing post-intervention to pre-intervention head impact data. Coach and player satisfaction were assessed to evaluate the program’s acceptability and impact. Results: 220 athletes (143 intervention; 77 control) participated. Of these, 32 (14%) were classified “high risk” with playing techniques amenable to intervention. Overall, 21 (66%) of mentored athletes demonstrated a reduction in top-of-head impacts (considered a high-risk impact zone) and 17 (53%) of mentored athletes demonstrated a reduction in high magnitude (&gt;60 g) hits. On average, the proportion of top-of-head impacts dropped 2.75% in mentored players, and 2.04% in non-mentored players. The proportion of head impacts classified as high-magnitude (&gt;60 g) dropped 1.07% from pre- to post-intervention in mentored players. There was minimal (&lt;1%) change in high magnitude impacts in non-mentored players. In post-season exit surveys, most mentored players “agreed” (n=18, 69%) that his playing behaviors improved because of the study. Most intervention team coaches thought the study was “effective” (n=31, 97%). Conclusions/Significance: Mentoring effects were modest; however, athletes and coaches viewed the program as effective. Behavioral interventions have potential to reduce head impact frequency and severity in football but may require more intensive mentoring than the 3-session model tested in this study.

https://openalex.org/W2935445085,Olympic Games Rio 2016: The Legacy for Coaches,2019-03-01,2019,article,"Abstract The purpose of this study is to identify the legacy of the Olympic Games for sports coaches with a special focus on professional education. Thus, in framing this study, two research questions are posed: 1) How did Olympic Games affect the characteristics of the educational activities for coaches? 2) What was the perception about the coaches' education in Brazil, and the legacy of the event for coach's education and career? The methodology used was the content analysis of the websites of National Sports Confederations, Institutions of Higher Education in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and the National and Regional Professional Councils in Brazil, totaling 70 institutions. Concomitantly, interviews were conducted with members of the Ministry of Sport, the Brazilian Olympic Academy, and the Federal Council of Physical Education. The interview questions were grounded on the theoretical framework of Sports Policy Factors Leading To International Sporting Success - SPLISS, which included: 1) the existence of well-trained and experience elite coaches in the country; 2) opportunities to develop their coaching career to become a world-class elite coach; 3) the status of coaches and the recognition of their work as valuable throughout the country. The results indicated that the event brought few benefits to coaches. In addition, according to the interviews, coaches play a secondary role in the organization of the Olympic Games, although they are considered fundamental for the development of the sport. Based on the results, this study discusses the education of coaches and the perceived importance of coaches according to the sports and educational institutions."

Methods: Descriptive data was collected from clinic inception (April 15, 2017) to June 30, 2018 and ranked by frequency. Results: 912 unique patients were seen. 66% were Female. 91% were at or below poverty level. 70% were African America, 27% White. 49% were uninsured, 18% Medicaid, 16% had a bridge-type of insurance unique to the area, 11% commercial insurance, and 6% Medicare. English (85%) and Spanish (7%) were most common languages. Comorbidities include obesity (69%), depression, other mental health disorder excluding drug or alcohol dependence, and anxiety (61%), hypertension (57%), asthma or COPD (28%), diabetes mellitus (20%). Reasons for chiropractic referral were low back pain (44%), neck pain (16%), mid back pain (12%), shoulder pain (8%), hip pain (6%), and knee pain (6%). Conclusion: Knowledge of patient demographics, comorbidities, and presenting complaints informs appropriate development of chiropractors operating within FQHCs. Awareness of cultural differences, appropriate co-management of listed comorbidities and mental health diagnoses, and expertise level understanding of non-specific spinal, shoulder, hip, and knee complaints is apparently warranted to best serve this patient population.

Methods: In addition to socio-demographic data and clinical covariates, baseline and comparative SOC was measured using the SOC-29 survey. Statistical analysis utilized a bootstrap paired t-test with a linear mixed model approach with practitioner as random blocking factor to examine the effects of a number of covariates. Results: A convenience sample of 1419 responders (1060 females; mean age =40.96 years) comprised our study population. They were highly educated with 87% (N=1240) attaining “some college education” or higher. The majority (N=720; 51%) indicated an MD/DO as their primary care provider. Wellness care and to improve symptoms were the major motivation for care (N=963; 68%). Baseline/comparative SOC scores were 148 (SD=22.19) and 150.70 (SD=23.59) with the observed mean for the bootstrap sample having a difference of 1.989 (95% CI:1.299, 2.759) at p=0.005 of the detected difference. We found minimal evidence (p>0.05) that covariates (i.e., age, gender, visit number, patient status, educational level, primary provider, motivation for care and duration of pain complaint) played a role in SOC change. Conclusion: The SOC of patients significantly increased with a course of chiropractic care. (This is a conference presentation abstract and not a full work that has been published.)Joel Alcantara, Andrew Whetten, Jeanne Ohm, Joey AlcantaraObjective: To determine changes in patients' global physical health (GPH) and global mental health (GMH) following a course of chiropractic care. Methods: In addition to socio-demographic data and clinical covariates (i.e., motivation for care), baseline and comparative GPH and GMH were measured using the PROMIS global health survey. Statistical analysis utilized a bootstrap paired t-test with a linear mixed model approach with practitioner as random blocking factor to examine the effects of a number of covariates. Results: A convenience sample of 1419 responders (1060 females; mean age =40.96 years) comprised our study population. The mean number of visits between measures was 4.15 (SD=4.24). Baseline/comparative scores were: GPH (49.52/50.73) and GMH: 50/52.41. The observed mean for the GPH bootstrap sample had a difference of 1.117 (95% CI:0.88, 1.405) with p=0.0071. The observed mean for the GMH bootstrap sample had a difference of 1.453 (95% CI: 1.122, 1.751) with p=0.0128. Increases in GPH and GMH were statistically significant. We found minimal evidence (p>0.05) that covariates (i.e., age, gender, educational level and motivation for care) played a role in the observed improvement in QoL. Conclusion: The quality of life of patients improved with a course of chiropractic care. (This is a conference presentation abstract and not a full work that has been published.)Joel Alcantara, Andrew Whetten, Jeanne Ohm, Joey AlcantaraObjective: To assess the predictive relationship between various quality of life (QoL) domains and sense of coherence (SOC). Methods: We measured the SOC and QoL of patients using the SOC-29 and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, respectively. Predictive relationships utilized random forest regression analysis. Results: Our convenience sample consisted of 1980 responders (average age=40.72 years; 1494 females). The mean SOC score was 148.3 (SD=22.37). The mean PROMIS T scores were: physical functioning (50.97), anxiety (52.03), depression (47.47), fatigue (51.15), sleep disturbance (49.85), ability to participate in social roles and activities (54.44), pain interference (51.27), global physical health (GPH) (49.34) and global mental health (GMH) (50.7). The variable importance plots indicated that GMH, anxiety and depression were several magnitudes higher as predictors for SOC compared to physical domains (i.e., physical functioning, pain interference). However, multi-dimensional partial dependence plots demonstrated interaction between physical domains such as fatigue and sleep disturbance to SOC. Therefore, physical domains of QoL cannot be discredited as nonessential in the prediction and understanding of a person's SOC. Conclusion: Despite the strong predictive relationship of mental health domains to SOC, physical domains cannot be discounted as playing a role.

Clinical Features: A 25-year-old male presented with left deep groin pain. The onset of provocation occurred while performing squat exercises. Left hip pain, reduced flexion range of motion, and positive orthopedic FAI tests were identified at examination. Interventions and Outcome: Following the radiographic diagnosis of bilateral cam-deformity and early-onset OA changes, an ultrasound (US) examination was performed, which showed real-time dynamic FAI. For further evaluation of acetabular labral pathology, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was recommended. At last follow-up, the patient elected to pursue an orthopedic consultation. Conservative care included Class IV therapeutic laser, soft tissue manipulation, assisted stretching, and psoas trigger point therapy. The patient reported no alleviation of symptoms. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the clinical manifestation and radiologic diagnoses in a rare presentation of early-onset bilateral hip OA changes. We present the efficacy of US in the diagnosis of FAI, but emphasize the value of MRI for labral pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating real-time impingement with a femoral head cam-deformity using US.

Methods: Students and faculty participants (n=88) completed a series of implicit attitude and belief measures. Results were compared to normative population values. Participants completed attitude- and belief-based Implicit Association Tests based on race- or obesity-based implicit biases. This reaction time measure of automatic memory-based associations asked participants to classify words into category pairs: good versus bad (attitude measure) and motivated versus lazy (stereotype measures). Results: Clear evidence for implicit negative racial and/or obesity bias was found in this group of participants. Compared with findings from the general public (race: 3,725,723 respondents; obesity: 334,135 respondents), respondents trended towards having more negative implicit biases concerning both race and weight. Conclusion: Future health care providers and faculty in this sample have strong negative racial and obesity bias, indicating pervasiveness of stigma toward racial minorities and obese persons. Additional research is needed to investigate how these attitudes and beliefs impact delivery of care.

Data Sources and Selection: We conducted a systematic and critical review searching on three databases from 2000 to 2017. Paired reviewers screened and critically appraised studies using the modified QUAREL and modified QUADAS-2 checklists. We used best evidence synthesis evidence from studies with low risk of bias and classified validity studies following Sackett and Haynes system. Results: We screened 1646 articles, 15 were low risk of bias. Twenty orthopaedic tests were studied. These studies reported: 1) modified Schobert test may be reliable [0.91<ICC (CI95% not reported)<0.97] but couldn't distinguish low back pain patients than controls; 2) hip extension test reliability [k=0.76 (IC 95 % : 0.57-0.95)] with validity phase II findings; 3) active straight leg raise reliability [0,53 (IC 95 % : 0,20-0,84) <k< 0,76 (IC 95 % : 0,57-0,96)] with phase I/II validity findings. Conclusions: Evidence is too preliminary to support reliability and validity of orthopaedic tests. More research (phase III) is needed to conclude on their clinical utility. (This is a conference presentation abstract and not a full work that has been published.)Patrick BattagliaObjective: To describe a series of cases where the availability of diagnostic ultrasound at the point of care was indispensable in providing an accurate diagnosis without delay or need for more expensive imaging, such as MRI. Clinical Features: This series highlights the following cases: rib fracture (negative radiographs), bilateral de Quervain stenosing tenosynovitis, gouty arthritis (negative radiographs), carpal tunnel syndrome with severe median nerve compression, and finger extensor tendon dislocation. Intervention and outcome: With an accurate diagnosis established, each patient received appropriate care. Patients with rib fracture and de Quervain stenosing tenosynovitis were managed conservatively. The patient with gouty arthritis was referred to primary care for medical management. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and extensor tendon dislocation were referred to orthopedics. Conclusion: Modern high frequency ultrasound transducers and systems can resolve musculoskeletal anatomy with superb resolution. As this case series demonstrates, making ultrasound available at the point of care may improve patient outcomes by establishing a correct diagnosis with minimal increase in cost. (This is a conference presentation abstract and not a full work that has been published.)Patrick Battaglia, Jesse Cooper, Todd ReiterObjective: To present a case report that highlights the risks of self-neck manipulation and describe a clinical scenario in which practitioners of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) should exercise appropriate caution with patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy. Clinical Features: A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department with worsening interscapular pain radiating to his neck 1 day following self-neck manipulation. He was found to be coagulopathic upon admission secondary to chronic warfarin therapy. The patient subsequently developed quadriparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multilevel spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) from the lower cervical to thoracic spine. Intervention and Outcome: The patient underwent emergency laminectomy for evacuation of SEH with placement of an epidural drainage catheter. He was admitted to an acute inpatient rehabilitation center for 2 weeks of physical and occupational therapy. The patient ultimately made a complete recovery. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of a patient with an underlying coagulopathy performing self-neck manipulation, which resulted in SEH and subsequent quadriparesis. The relationship between SEH and SMT warrants further investigation. Until then, anticoagulation therapy or known coagulopathy should be considered a relative contraindication to SMT. (This is a conference presentation abstract and not a full work that has been published.)Kyle Bills, Scott SteffensenObjective: Very little is known about the extra-somatosensory effects of spinal mechanoreceptor-based therapies on the supraspinal central nervous system. We examined changes in firing rate and neurotransmitter release in the mesolimbic system, an area highly involved in addiction, induced by activation of spinal mechanoreceptors at the cervical spine in a rodent model. Methods: We utilized single-cell in vivo electrophysiology, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to measure changes in neuron firing rate and dopamine (DA) release. Spinal mechanoreceptors were activated by microcontroller driven implanted motors. Results: We show that spinal mechanoreceptor activation transiently depresses GABA neurons and excites DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area while increasing DA release in the nucleus accumbens. These effects are frequency and anatomically dependent and driven by endogenous release of opioids. Conclusion: Spinal mechanoreceptor activation modulates neuron firing and neurotransmitter release in the mesolimbic system. This study demonstrates that peripheral stimulation at the spine is sufficient to alter supraspinal neuronal function at the cellular level. Further, that spinal-based therapies carry potential as adjunctive treatments for drug-abuse disorders.

Methods: Participants completed informed consent, Numeric Pain Rating Scale(NPRS), Roland-Morris LBP and Disability Questionnaire(RMDQ), and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire(FABQ). Subjects were randomized into 1 of 4 at-home pain management groups, [Group 1 (Biofreeze+Tape), Group 2 (Tape), Group 3 (Biofreeze), Group 4 (Advice)]. The groups followed the same protocol, rating their pain at 2nd (T2) and 3rd (T3) office visits. At one week(T4) participants completed the NPRS, RMDQ, and FABQ. In addition to pain and outcomes, at home pain management compliance and pain medication were documented on a daily basis. Results: A total of 106 participants completed the study (Group 1 = 25, Group 2 = 28, Group 3 = 26, Group 4 = 27). Group 1 significantly changed their for FABQ-PA score over time (p=0.000) from T1(x=19.2) to T2(x=14.2). There was also a significant decrease in FABQ-Total score over time (p=0.002) for all groups except Group 4. All groups except Group 4 also significantly improved (p=0.000) RMDQ scores from T1 to T4. Pain significantly declined (p=0.000) in all groups over time. Conclusion: The use of TBKT, Biofreeze, or combination improved pain and function in participants with acute, non-complicated LBP.

Clinical Features: The patient fell and struck her left-zygoma (zygomatic-nasomaxilla region), which was fractured and lost consciousness due to the head trauma. Following the accident she received physical, vestibular, and chiropractic spinal therapies for approximately three-months with no relief or change in symptomatology. Three-months post-trauma she presented to this office with chronic symptoms (VAS 8/10): pelvic pain, upper-cervical spine pain, difficulty swallowing due to supra/infrahyoidal myofascial disorder, pain in the left-maxillozygomatic joint (radiated into her nose), numbness to region of facial trauma, vertigo and tinnitus. Intervention/Outcome: In the first four-weeks at this office (seen twice-a-week) she received sacro occipital technique (SOT), cranial manipulative care, TMJ care, and co-treated with dentist (lower dental splint therapy) with marked improvement (VAS 3-4/10). In the ensuing four-months she was seen twice-a-month with steady improvement following each office visit. By the 5-month mark her symptomatology had predominately resolved (VAS 1/10), with only mild intermittent brief pains in the cervical spine and ear. Conclusion: Further research is indicated to determine if other patients with similar presentations might benefit from these chiropractic methods.

MdDS's underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood and therefore, treatment options are limited. Clinical Features: For 4-years, prior to being seen at this office, the patient had chronic atypical vertigo with 2-3 flareups per year with durations lasting 3-4 months. A brain MRI was unremarkable though a cervical MRI revealed spondolytic and discogenic degenerative changes. She reported that prior to 4-years she traveled on approximately 20-cruise ship vacations. Intervention and Outcome: The patient was treated for eight-visits over a 6-week period of time. SOT and cranial/TMJ care was rendered with adjustments to the cervical/thoracic spine. She also received cranial/dental co-treatment with a lower occlusal splint and seen at this office once-a-week for three-weeks in a row, with her splint being dentally equilibrated immediately following cranial treatment. After the eighth-visit she experienced complete relief of symptoms. A year following her 8th-office-visit her condition has remained stable. Conclusion: Conservative care for complex patient presentations are always an optimal option and further study in chiropractic care of MdDS might be warranted. (This is a conference presentation abstract and not a full work that has been published.)Charles BlumObjective: Ideally chiropractic seeks to optimize patient care collaboratively working within interdisciplinary relationships. One condition discussed in both dental and chiropractic arenas involves the ramifications of forward-head-posture (FHP) positioning. Determining causation is a crucial part of the differential diagnostic process since misdiagnosis can lead to poor patient outcomes. Data Sources and Selection: A selective search of PubMed was performed to assess both chiropractic and dental perspectives of FHP. Results: Chiropractic studies tended to focus on FHP as related to a spinal curve that needed to be “corrected,” secondary to poor posture/ergonomics. Dental studies tended to focus on FHP as being an adaptation secondary to airway compromise, related to craniomandibular joint disorders (CMD). Yet another group of studies determined that FHP conversely leads airway compromise. Conclusion: Airway compromise and apneas have drastic long-term effects on patient mortality and morbidity. Chiropractic care needs to take into account possible adaptive FHP positioning, since “correcting” a spinal curve may aggravate airway compromise. Likewise dentistry treating CMD may need to consider co-treatment with chiropractors since FHP may contribute to a patient's airway compromise. Therefore obstructive sleep related apneas related to FHP might require dental/chiropractic interdisciplinary care for optimal patient outcomes.

Methods: Investigators developed an ED training session for teaching clinicians and interns in a DC program. Pre- and post-training surveys captured long-term knowledge retention. The surveys contained a 20 items centered on respondents' self-perceptions of their ED knowledge (1 = minimal, 5 = extensive), ability to identify ED, and common clinical signs / symptoms of ED. Investigators used cumulative scores ranging from 0 (no correct responses) to 17 (all correct responses) to assess respondent understanding. Results: The study had 107 pre- and 96 post-training respondents (83/77students, 24/19 instructors). Chance differences occurred for pre- (M=13.63) and post-training (M= 13.71) and mean cumulative scores (t(153) = -1.399, p = .164). Significant pre- (M=2.73) and post-training (M=3.11) differences occurred for respondents' knowledge (t(196) = -2.951, p < .01). Respondents' confidence in ED patient identification rose from 2.7 to 3.1 post-training. Conclusion: Although the training did not significantly impact respondents' cumulative scores, it did seem to impact their perceptions of knowing more about ED and slightly increased their confidence in identifying patients with ED.

Methods: Gender and projected income of 1, 5, and 10 years as well as a calculated break-even month was extracted from class business plans of end-of-term 9th trimester students. Change in income was computed based on expected income from month 1 to 10 years. Projected income was adjusted for the median income of the practice location. Non-parametric tests were run in SPSS V25. Results: 123 (80 male) cases were examined. Males reached a break-even point median at month 7, females 5 months. Median projected income year 1 males n=74 (19811.5) females n=40 (11581.0) p=.7, year 5 males n=80 (63300.0) females n=43 (34813.0) p=.003 and year 10 males n=80 (150699.0) females n=43 (305039.44) p<.001. Change in adjusted income males n=74 (210842.00) females n=40 (130913.5) p<.001. Conclusion: In this population of DC students, women have lower projected income expectations by five years and ten years in practice than their male colleagues. Women also have lower expectations of income increase over 10 years. Males expect an earlier projected break-even point than females.

It was hypothesized that the combined care could impact the vestibulocollic reflex pattern and thereby address the scoliosis and headaches. Clinical Features: Optometric diagnoses included convergence insufficiency and significant visually-guided body movement (gross motor) deficits. Initial chiropractic exam findings were 4° right thoracic and 9° left lumbar curvatures along with multiple levels of vertebral joint dysfunction. Her headaches were rated as moderate and frequent. Outcome measurements included: Neck Index, Back Index, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, and International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale. Intervention and Outcome: The patient received therapeutic glasses with mild prisms and underwent standard optometric vision therapy for a year. During that same time, she was assessed and received monthly manipulative therapy. At the conclusion of therapy, headaches were moderate and occasional with 3° thoracic and 3° lumbar curvatures. At 3-month follow-up her headaches were moderate and frequent with 3° thoracic and 5° lumbar curvatures. Conclusion: No statistically significant changes in outcome measures were found, showing that the scoliosis had not progressed.

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of administrative data from a national cohort study of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with at least one visit to a VA chiropractic clinic from 2001-2014 was performed. The prevalence of PTSD was modeled by logistic regression using covariates of sex, race, age, body mass index (BMI), pain intensity, alcohol and substance use disorders, and smoking status. Results: We identified 14,205 Veterans who received chiropractic care, with a mean age of 38 years, 15.8% women Veterans, and 54.24% having a diagnosis of PTSD. On multivariate analysis, significant association was found between PTSD prevalence and male sex, younger age, BMI ≥ 30, moderate to severe pain intensity, alcohol and substance use disorders, and current smoking status. Conclusions: PTSD among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans receiving VA chiropractic care is common and associated with several patient demographic and clinical factors. Recognition of these factors is important for appropriate diagnosis and management of Veterans with PTSD who seek chiropractic treatment for pain conditions, given the biopsychosocial model of pain.

https://openalex.org/W2934216704,RELIABILITY OF A NEW LANDING ERROR SCORING SYSTEM: THE LESS-RMC,2019-03-01,2019,article,"BACKGROUND Several biomechanical deficits have been shown to increase non-contact knee injury risk of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) is a clinical assessment tool that has been successfully used to predict the individuals that are at a high risk for injury and evaluate changes in landing technique after participation in a neuromuscular preventive training program. The LESS-RT is a shortened version of the LESS and is a method to score landing technique without the use of video. The current study proposes a new tool for the evaluation of landing technique and ACL injury risk that blends the LESS and LESS-RT protocols but emphasizes the movement features that contribute to high knee valgus moments including movement asymmetry. The LESS-RMC (Rocky Mountain Consortium) consists of evaluating 11 comprehensive landing errors that are related to ACL injury risk. Consolidating questions pertaining to the opposite ends of joint motion such as “toe in” and “toe out” into “maximum foot rotation position” and adding a global asymmetry score were performed to reduce the time demands for evaluation yet capture the salient factors of the LESS; whereas the penalty for knee valgus severity was pulled from the LESS-RT but implemented for both knees in the new LESS-RMC to ultimately stratify knee injury risk during the jump landing task. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the new LESS-RMC assessment tool. METHODS Thirty-seven, elite female soccer athletes (13.2 +/- 0.4 y) performed three drop-jumps from a height of 30 cm. Front and side views of the landing were recorded with digital video cameras. Movement quality was rated by 4 researchers evaluating 17 components of the landing with the LESS and a modified, 11 component version of the LESS (LESS-RMC). The 4 raters were novel to the evaluation of both scoring systems. Each rater was trained how to score each test and was instructed to evaluate the landing trials from the first 10 participants. After a group video review and discussion, the raters repeated the scoring procedures for the same 10 participants 48 hours after the original review. After another 48 hours, the raters evaluated the landing trials for all 37 participants (111 trials). Inter-rater reliability of the LESS and LESS-RMC were determined using the ICC (3,1) equations and the output from a two-way ANOVA (SPSS, version 25). RESULTS The mean LESS score was 6.45 +/- 0.55 (rater 1, 6.42; rater 2, 7.15; rater 3, 5.79; rater 4, 6.45). The ICC agreement between raters of scoring the LESS was .389 whereas the ICC agreement for the mean of the four raters was .718. The ICC for scoring consistency was .382 and Cronbach’s a was .735. The mean LESS-RMC score was 6.19 +/- 0.74 (rater 1, 5.65; rater 2, 6.99; rater 3, 5.48; rater 4, 6.64). The ICC agreement of scoring the LESS-RMC was .585 whereas the ICC agreement for the mean of the four raters was .849. The ICC for scoring consistency was .574 and Cronbach’s a was .884. CONCLUSION On average, the raters scored the LESS and the LESS-RMC with moderate reliability across the group of athletes. The LESS-RMC was scored with greater reliability than the LESS for this group of relatively novice raters. This is likely due to the simplification of the overall protocol in terms of quantity of questions, the ability of a novel rater to understand scenarios which elicit specific scores and the clear separation of body segments (e.g. hip and trunk flexion). In conjunction with this, it was reported by the raters that LESS-RMC was less redundant and more effective at assessing crucial aspects of a jump landing pattern. Overall, LESS RMC was objectively and subjectively more reliable and easier to use than the LESS for the four raters involved in this study. It is concluded that the LESS-RMC is a quick, easy and reliable clinical assessment tool that may be used to stratify individuals who may be at risk for ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W2935051175,CAN A WEARABLE NEUROMUSCUAR DEVICE REPLACE NEUROMUSCULAR TRAINING PROGRAMS?,2019-03-01,2019,article,"Background: Scientific studies have shown female soccer athletes to be 3 times more likely to injure their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) than their male counterparts and the majority of these injuries are from a non-contact mechanism. The biomechanical factors of this phenomenon have been extensively studied in a laboratory-based setting, but there has been little progress in reducing the incidence of ACL injury in young female athletes. It is plausible, therefore, to suggest that the biomechanical improvements noted in a laboratory-based setting do not directly translate to a field-based setting. Preventive neuromuscular training programs are typically field-based and have been shown to be an effective intervention for reducing ACL injury risk by improving dynamic, frontal-plane knee stability. However, these programs are time consuming and prone to compliance and implementation issues. For these reasons, researchers have attempted to identify the minimum viable training program or wearable device that can be studied in the field using video cameras to determine their influence on movement-related risk factors for ACL injury. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a wearable neuromuscular device (WND) with or without the addition of a field-based, preventive neuromuscular training program on jump-landing risk assessment in young female soccer athletes. Methods: Thirty-nine female soccer players (161.0 +/- 6.6 cm; 49.4 kg +/- 5.9; 13.3 +/- 0.5 y) from two different teams in a local soccer club volunteered to participate in this study. Team 1 (n = 25) performed a 6-week, field-based NMT program while wearing a WND. The NMT was instructed by a trained exercise specialist. The NMT program was divided into three, two-week blocks of progressively increasing levels of exercise complexity and intensity focused on improving the strength and activation behavior of the trunk, hip and thigh muscles. Field-based movement testing was performed in the first week before training began (pre-test) and in the seventh week upon completion of the NMT program (post-test). During testing video cameras recorded a jump-landing task in the frontal and sagittal planes. The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) and a novel version of the LESS (LESS-RMC) was used to asses movement quality related to ACL injury risk. Team 2 (n=14) wore the WND for an equal amount of athletic exposures over 7 weeks but did not perform the NMT program. Four different raters were recruited to visually score all jump landing trials using the two different rating protocols during the pre-test and post-test. For each visual assessment (LESS &amp; LESS-RMC) a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to explore within group (test) and between group (team) differences. Results: Repeated measure ANOVA results for the LESS score scale indicated a significant within factor difference in pretest and post test scores F(7.398, 27.533) = 8.598, P &lt; 0.05. Pretest scores for team 1 (6.18 +/- 1.68) and team 2 (6.95 +/- 0.94) both saw a significant reduction in ACL risk scores to 5.44 +/- 1.70 and 6.31 +/- 1.75, respectively. ANOVA results for the LESS-RMC scale also indicated a significant within factor difference in pretest and posttests F(6.756, 35.624) = 6.069, p &lt; 0.05. Pretest scores for Team 1 (6.02 +/- 1.99) and Team 2 (6.49 +/- 1.33) both saw a significant reduction in ACL risk scores to 5.10 +/- 1.77 and 6.09 +/- 1.50, respectively. ANOVA results revealed no significant differences between team scores for the LESS (F(0.031,27.533) = 0.036, p &gt; 0.05) or LESS-RMC (F(1.053,35.624) = .946, p &gt; 0.05) scales. Conclusion: The results reveal that the NMT program utilized in this study had no statistically significant additive effect on the visual risk assessment scores for Team 1 compared to Team 2, who had no NMT intervention and only wore the WND. Collectively, these results suggest that simply wearing a WND during 6 weeks of practice may be a less evasive and cheaper alternative to a NMT program."

Thirty six athletes with (16) and without (20) CAI participated. Bilateral electromyography of peroneus longus (PL), peroneus brevis (PB), tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles was collected during a unilateral sudden inversion perturbation to assess the timing of MLR onset, in both standing and perturbed positions, through a baseline-based method and a peak-response-based method. The group without CAI presented higher relative reliability of SOL and peroneal muscles MLR with the peak response-based method than with the baseline-based method. Compared with the group without CAI and in both methods, the group with CAI presented a delayed and less reliable TA MLR, as well decreased coefficient variation of PL MLR in the uninjured limb. In conclusion, regardless of the method subjects with CAI present delayed and less reliable TA MLR while in subjects without CAI the peak response-based method provides higher reliability."

Concussion remains one of the inherent risks of participation in rugby union with Certain facets of play, as well as specific tactics and strategies in contact and collision predispose athletes to a greater chance of sustaining a concussion. While other injuries incurred by rugby players have been well studied, less focus and attention has been directed towards concussion. The Third International Conference on Concussion in Sport defined concussion as a complex pathophysiologic process induced by traumatic biomechanical forces. World Rugby (previously known as the International Rugby Board or IRB) has acknowledged that there is a significant risk associated with concussions, and have subsequently implemented a risk management strategy [1]. This systematic review aims to evaluate the available evidence on concussion in Rugby Union (here- after referred to as ‘rugby’) and to conduct an analysis of findings regarding the incidence of concussion and players knowledge on concussion. Data was collected through Library Research on Masinde Muliro university of science and technology, Kenya rugby union, Kenya rugby football clubs, internets and Hospitals and clinics affiliated to Rugby. A desk review was also conducted and a search done PsycINFO®, MEDLINE™, Embase, SPORTDiscus™, Crossref, British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) Genamics Journal Seek, Global impact factor.com, Google Scholar, Academic keys, Open Academic Journals Index, Sherpa/RoMEO (University of Nottingham), Chemical Abstracts (CAS) and Open-j-Gate. Precisely the pathophysiology of concussion is not well known but recent research show that moderate to severe brain injury causes intricate torrent of neurochemical changes in the brain. The assumption is that similar changes occur in concussion. Paucity of literature exists on player knowledge of concussion or the rate of reporting of this injury despite there now being over 20, 000 adult rugby players in Ireland only but other studies showed that participants displayed a relatively high level of knowledge with regard to what constitutes a concussion, the risk that a history of concussion holds with regard to future concussion, and the authority that should rest with medical doctors in clearing players to Return To Play following concussion. In future Biomechanical research should be done with other clinical based research to improve on sideline concussion recognition and treatment modalities. In conclusion more research on concussion education, sensitization and awareness on concussion to help reduce incidences of concussion."

This study aimed to compare HIE in practice drills among 6 youth football teams and to evaluate the effect of a team on HIE. METHODS On-field head impact data were collected from athletes (ages 10–13 years) playing on 6 local youth football teams (teams A–F) during all practices using the Head Impact Telemetry System. Video was recorded and analyzed to verify and assign impacts to a specific drill. Drills were identified as follows: dummy/sled tackling, half install, install, install walk through, multiplayer tackle, Oklahoma, one-on-one, open field tackling, other, passing, position skill work, scrimmage, special teams, tackling drill stations, and technique. HIE was quantified in terms of impacts per player per minute (ppm) and peak linear and rotational head acceleration. Generalized linear models were used to assess differences in head impact magnitude and frequency among drills as well as among teams within the most common drills. RESULTS Among 67 athlete-seasons, a total of 14,718 impacts during contact practices were collected and evaluated in this study. Among all 6 teams, the mean linear (p &lt; 0.0001) and rotational (p &lt; 0.0001) acceleration varied significantly among all drills. Open field tackling had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher mean linear acceleration than all other drills. Multiplayer tackle had the highest mean impact rate (0.35 ppm). Significant variations in linear acceleration and impact rate were observed among teams within specific drills. Team A had the highest mean linear acceleration in install, one-on-one, and open field tackling and the highest mean impact rate in Oklahoma and position skill work. Although team A spent the greatest proportion of their practice on minimal- or no-player versus player contact drills (27%) compared to other teams, they had the highest median (20.2 g ) and 95th percentile (56.4 g ) linear acceleration in practice. CONCLUSIONS Full-speed tackling and blocking drills resulted in the highest HIE. Reducing time spent on contact drills relative to minimal or no contact drills may not lower overall HIE. Instead, interventions such as reducing the speed of players engaged in contact, correcting tackling technique, and progressing to contact may reduce HIE more effectively."

However, little is known of the regular head loading environment associated with tackling in rugby union. In particular, the magnitude and influencing factors for head kinematics during the tackle are poorly understood. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to measure head motion of a visually unaware ball carrier during a real game tackle to the upper trunk with no direct head contact, and compare the kinematics with previously reported concussive events. Model-Based Image-Matching was utilised to measure ball carrier head linear and angular velocities. Ball carrier componential maximum change in head angular velocities of 38.1, 20.6 and 13.5 rad/s were measured for the head local X (coronal plane), Y (sagittal plane) and Z (transverse plane) axes respectively. The combination of a high legal tackle height configuration and visually unaware ball carrier can lead to kinematics similar to average values previously reported for concussive direct head impacts."

Technical skill assessments are used throughout the talent pathway to monitor athletes in an attempt to more effectively predict future performance. These assessments however, largely focus on the isolated execution of key skills devoid of any game context. When assessments are representative of match-play and applied in a setting where all four components of competition (i.e., technical, tactical, physiological and psychological) are assessed within an integrated approach, prediction of talent is more likely to be successful. This article explores the current talent identification technical skill assessments, with a particular focus on Australian Football, and proposes a 5-level performance assessment model for athlete assessment. The model separates technical game skill on a continuum from Level-1 (i.e., laboratory analysis) to Level-5 (i.e., match-play). These levels, using the assumptions of the expert performance model and representative learning design theory, incorporate a step-wise progression of performance demands to more closely represent match-play conditions. The proposed model will provide researchers and practitioners with a structured framework to consider when assessing, or developing, new assessments of technical game-based skill."

Young college adults often gain weight due to decreased exercise. Purpose: This study seeks to understand whether wearable exercise technology is associated with increased exercise among university students. Methods: A questionnaire identified motivational stages for exercise and wearable use. Results: Of the 115 students meeting all three FIT recommendations, 70 regularly exercised within the last 6 months. Of these, nearly half (n = 31) also regularly wore a wearable technology. Overall, 90 students were identified as regularly using wearable technology, 31 met all three FIT recommendations, and 53 met two FIT recommendations (frequency and time). Of total regular exercisers meeting two of three recommendations (n = 112), nearly half (n = 53) were wearable technology users. Discussion: Findings suggest that wearables may be associated with increased exercise and FIT values among university students. Translation to Health Education Practice: Wearable exercise technology has potential to enhance theory-based physical activity promotion to help students increase exercise and decrease risks of obesity and chronic disease. Future studies could examine how active student exercisers and active users of wearable technology use that technology to motivate them to exercise more.A AJHE Self-Study quiz is online for this article via the SHAPE America Online Institute (SAOI) http://portal.shapeamerica.org/trn-Webinars"

This cross-sectional study examined the lifetime prevalence of concussion in adult BJJ practitioners in the United States using a 17-item survey. A total of 778 (11.4% female) BJJ practitioners with a median age of 31 years completed the survey. Overall, the lifetime prevalence of the self-reported BJJ-related concussion was 25.2%. However, the prevalence was higher among females than males (43.0% versus 22.9%; X²(1,740) = 15.129; p < 0.001). Factors independently associated with significantly increased odds of having sustained a BJJ-related concussion included a prior history of concussion (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.14⁻2.74; p = 0.011) and female gender (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.04⁻3.65; p = 0.037). The median return to sports time was three days, with 30.3% of participants returning on the same day as being concussed. The present study represents the first epidemiological research examining the concussions in BJJ. The results underscore the need for increased education on concussions and return to sports guidelines among BJJ coaches and practitioners."

To achieve this purpose, 86 right-footed participants (young children (5– 8), adolescents (10–14), young adults (18–25) and older adults (over 50) were tested on two tasks of different levels of difficulty, performed in three spatial locations (left, right, and midline) according to two levels of body posture: sitting and standing. Results revealed that the participants favored their preferred foot when the object was located in the ipsilateral hemispace and at the midline. They selected their non-preferred foot when the object was located in the contralateral hemispace. The participants used their preferred foot to a greater extent during the most complex task than during the easiest one and more often while standing rather than sitting. Finally, we have found a significant age effect. Young children often used the preferred foot more frequently than the other age groups. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that foot selection depends on task demand, environmental constraints, and a biological factor associated with motor dominance."

Background: Caregivers suffer from high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, which is associated with manual patient handling. However, there is not enough information available on the efficacy of various friction-reducing devices in reducing biomechanical stresses in the upper extremities and low back. Method: During patient-transfer tasks performed by 20 caregivers, we measured hand force; shoulder and trunk posture; shoulder moment; muscle activity in the flexor digitorum superficialis, extensor digitorum communis, biceps, triceps, trapezius, and erector spinae; and usability ratings from four devices: a draw sheet, a repositioning sheet, a slide board, and an air-assisted device. In addition, triaxial head acceleration of mock patients was measured to evaluate patients’ head acceleration. Results: The slide board and air-assisted device significantly reduced hand force ( p &lt; .001), shoulder flexion ( p &lt; .001), shoulder moment ( p &lt; .001), muscle activities of caregivers ( p &lt; .004), and patients’ head acceleration ( p &lt; .023) compared with the draw sheet. However, no significant differences in biomechanical measures were found between the repositioning and draw sheets. The air-assisted device consistently showed the lowest biomechanical stresses and was most preferred by participants. Conclusion: Reduction in caregivers’ biomechanical stresses and mock patients’ head acceleration indicates that a slide board and an air-assisted device can be effective engineering controls to reduce risk of injury. Application: The study results can provide a recommendation for engineering controls to reduce biomechanical stresses for both caregivers and patients."
https://openalex.org/W2917990338,Helmet Design Based on the Optimization of Biocomposite Energy-Absorbing Liners under Multi-Impact Loading,2019-02-20,2019,article,"Cellular materials have been used in many applications such as insulation, packaging, and protective gear. Expanded polystyrene has been widely used as energy-absorbing liner in helmets due to its excellent cost-benefit relation. This synthetic material can absorb reasonable amounts of energy via permanent deformation. However, in real-world accidents, helmets may be subjected to multi-impact scenarios. Additionally, oil-derived plastic is presently a major source of societal concern regarding pollution and waste. As a sustainable alternative, cork is a natural cellular material with great crashworthiness properties and it has the remarkable capacity to recover after compression, due to its viscoelastic behavior, which is a desired characteristic in multi-impact applications. Therefore, the main goal is to analyze the applicability of agglomerated cork as padding material in safety helmets. First, a finite element model of a motorcycle helmet available on the market was developed to assess its safety performance and to establish a direct comparison between expanded polystyrene and cork agglomerates as liners. Secondly, a new helmet model with a generic geometry was developed to assess the applicability of agglomerated cork as liner for different types of helmets, based on the head injury risk predictions by the finite element head model, YEt Another Head Model (YEAHM), developed by the authors. Several versions of helmet liners were created by varying its thickness and removing sections of material. In other words, this generic helmet was optimized by carrying out a parametric study, and by comparing its performance under double impacts. The results from these tests indicate that agglomerated cork liners are an excellent alternative to the synthetic ones. Thus, agglomerated cork can be employed in protective gear, improving its overall performance and capacity to withstand multi-impacts."

The complex pathophysiology of neural injury is a primary barrier to developing sensitive and specific diagnostic tools, which consequentially has a detrimental effect on treatment regimens. Biomarkers of other diseases (e.g. cancer) have provided critical insight into disease emergence and progression that lend to developing powerful clinical tools for intervention. Therefore, the biomarker discovery field has recently focused on TBI and made substantial advancements to characterize markers with promise of transforming TBI patient diagnostics and care. This review focuses on these key advances in neural injury biomarkers discovery, including novel approaches spanning from omics-based approaches to imaging and machine learning as well as the evolution of established techniques."

Accordingly, the goal of this study was to utilise whole-body motion data from twenty upper and mid/lower trunk rugby shoulder tackles recorded in a marker-based 3D motion analysis laboratory to assess the MADYMO human body passive ellipsoid model for head kinematic reconstruction. Head linear and angular velocity during the tackle for the multibody model predictions and 3D motion laboratory measures were recorded for the ball carrier. Examined were the linear and angular velocity, as well as the absolute and percentage differences. For upper trunk tackles, the median percentage error (with quartiles) for the MADYMO predictions were 10% (6% to 45%) and 23% (16% to 39%) for change in head linear and angular velocity, respectively. For mid/lower trunk tackles, the median percentage error (with quartiles) for the MADYMO predictions were 46% (33% to 63%) and 60% (53% to 123%) for change in head linear and angular velocity, respectively. In conclusion, the model is currently unsuitable for reconstruction of head kinematics during individual rugby union tackle cases."
https://openalex.org/W2916614547,Construction of a risk model through the fusion of experimental data and finite element modeling: Application to car crash-induced TBI,2019-02-18,2019,article,"This article introduces a new approach for the construction of a risk model for the prediction of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as a result of a car crash. The probability of TBI is assessed through the fusion of an experiment-based logistic regression risk model and a finite element (FE) simulation-based risk model. The proposed approach uses a multilevel framework which includes FE simulations of vehicle crashes with dummy and FE simulations of the human brain. The loading conditions derived from the crash simulations are transferred to the brain model thus allowing the calculation of injury metrics such as the Cumulative Strain Damage Measure (CSDM). The framework is used to propagate uncertainties and obtain probabilities of TBI based on the CSDM injury metric. The risk model from FE simulations is constructed from a support vector machine classifier, adaptive sampling, and Monte-Carlo simulations. An approach to compute the total probability of TBI, which combines the FE-based risk assessment as well as the risk prediction from the experiment-based logistic regression model is proposed. In contrast to previous published work, the proposed methodology includes the uncertainty of explicit parameters such as impact conditions (e.g., velocity, impact angle), and material properties of the brain model. This risk model can provide, for instance, the probability of TBI for a given assumed crash impact velocity."

Twenty-one males and 22 females (similar to collegiate club-sport and tactical athletes) were assessed in: 505 and COD deficit from each leg; IAT; 20 m sprint; vertical jump (VJ height, peak anaerobic power measured in watts (PAPw), power-to-body mass ratio); standing broad jump; lateral jump (LJ) from each leg; and absolute and relative isometric midthigh pull (IMTP) strength. Partial correlations calculated sex-determined relationships between the COD and performance tests, with regression equations calculated (p &lt; 0.05). The 505 and IAT correlated with all tests except PAPw and absolute IMTP (r = ±0.43–0.71). COD deficit correlated with the LJ (r = −0.34–0.60). Left- and right-leg 505 was predicted by sex, 20 m sprint, and left-leg LJ (70–77% explained variance). Right-leg COD deficit was predicted by sex and left-leg LJ (27% explained variance). IAT was predicted by sex, 20 m sprint, right-leg LJ, and relative IMTP (84% explained variance). For individuals with limited training time, improving linear speed, and relative lower-body power and strength, could enhance shorter and longer COD performance."

Previous studies have shown a high incidence of matches ending due to strikes to the head but did not consider weight categories and female fights. This study aimed at analyzing match stoppages in MMA and the exposure to head trauma distinguished by sex and weight categories.The heavier the weight class, the greater the risk and incidence of head trauma will be, regardless of sex.Descriptive epidemiology study.Level 3.Publicly available data of 167 MMA events from 1903 fights between 2014 and 2017 were assessed, comprising 8 male and 2 female weight categories.The combined KO/TKO rates per 100 athlete-exposures in the middleweight (19.53), light heavyweight (20.8), and heavyweight (26.09) divisions were greater than previously reported for MMA. While stoppage via KO/TKO occurred in 7.9% of combats in the female strawweight division, it occurred in 52.1% of the male heavyweight fights. The male middleweight ( P = 0.001), light heavyweight ( P < 0.001), and heavyweight divisions ( P < 0.001) had an increased risk of KO/TKO due to strikes to the head by 80%, 100%, and 206%, respectively. The risk in the flyweight division decreased 62% ( P = 0.001). All categories were compared with the lightweight division. The female bantamweight category presented a 221% increased risk in matches ending due to KO/TKO compared with the strawweight division ( P = 0.012). Punches to the head were the major technique used to end a combat via KO/TKO, regardless of sex and weight class.Head injury risk and incidence varies considerably according to sex and weight category in MMA.The analysis of head trauma exposure in MMA athletes should be distinguished according to sex and weight category."

The gold standard in diagnostic imaging of muscle injuries is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radiologists need to be familiar with typical MRI findings in order to accurately detect and classify muscle injuries. Proper interpretation of the findings is crucial, especially in elite athletes. In soccer players, muscle injuries of the hip and thigh are the most common reason for missing a game. The present pictorial review deals with the diagnostic assessment, especially MRI, of muscle injuries of the hip and thigh. Typical MR findings in muscle injuries include edema, hematoma, and tendinous avulsion as well as partial or complete muscle tear. To estimate the time to return to play, a grading into three groups—muscle strain, partial tear, complete tear—has traditionally been used. Taking into account the most recent literature, there are other prognostic factors such as the longitudinal length of a tear, the tendon's intramuscular component, or persisting edema."

Seventy-three young athletes performed maximum isokinetic concentric and eccentric knee extension and flexion efforts at 60 °·s-1 and 240 °·s-1 from hip flexion angles of 90°, 60°, and 120°. The conventional (concentric to concentric), functional (eccentric to concentric) and mixed (eccentric at 30 °·s-1 to concentric torque at 240 °·s-1) H: Q torque ratios and the electromyographic activity from the rectus femoris and biceps femoris were analyzed. The conventional H:Q ratios and the functional H:Q ratios at 60 °·s-1 did not significantly differ between the three testing positions (p > 0.05). In contrast, testing from the 90° hip flexion angle showed a greater functional torque ratio at 240 °·s-1 and a mixed H:Q torque ratio compared with the other two positions (p < 0.05). The hip flexion angle did not influence the recorded muscle activation signals (p > 0.05). For the range of hip flexion angles tested, routine isokinetic assessment of conventional H:Q ratio and functional H:Q ratio at slow speed is not angle-dependent. Should assessment of the functional H:Q ratio at fast angular velocity or the mixed ratio is required, then selection of hip flexion angle is important."

Twenty female Division II varsity soccer players (age = 20.3 ± 1.1 yr, body mass index = 22.4 ± 1.80 kg·m −2 ) completed two experimental trials in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Each trial consisted of four intervals on a motorized treadmill consisting of 4 min of running (4 × 4) at 90%–95% HR max with 3 min of passive recovery between each interval. HR recovery was collected during the first 60 s of each recovery, where volume of carbon dioxide (V̇CO 2 ) and tidal volume (V T ) were recorded each minute during the 3-min recovery period. Results showed an improved HR recovery ( P &lt; 0.001), greater V T ( P = 0.008), and increased V̇CO 2 ( P = 0.049), with HK (53 ± 10.9 bpm; 1.44 ± 0.2 L·min −1 , 1.13 ± 0.2 L·min −1 ) compared with HH (31 ± 11.3 bpm; 1.34 ± 0.2 L·min −1 , 1.03 ± 0.2 L·min −1 ).

Paradoxically, care has been identified as an essential aspect of coaching pedagogy. Thus, this study drew upon the experience of a case-study strength and conditioning coach to explore caring in a Premier League Football Club. A naturally occurring reflective diary served as a primary data source. Findings revealed that the coach ""cared for"" an athlete through a ""rules based"" approach, which thus far has not been described within coaching research. The narrative also suggested that care was constrained by the competitive context which requires coaches to ""care about"" results, and individuals around the club, e.g. themselves, staff and supporters. This study should prompt significant consideration by coaches who might examine how care is influenced by contextual factors, whilst simultaneously providing novel insights for coaching researchers who may further consider ""rule based"" approaches to care."

Concussion is considered a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), which is self-limited. Repetitive mTBI has been associated with chronic, progressive neurological damage. Extreme biochemical changes occur in neuron cells as a result of mTBI. These metabolic disturbances may reflect the symptoms observed in patients who had suffered concussions. However, it has been difficult to correlate clinical signs and symptoms. Currently, there are no laboratory tests to diagnose concussion, though several biomarkers are being investigated. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biochemical details of the metabolic cascade and the associated time frame, which will help determine when an athlete can safely return to the game."

Numerous neurobiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated the close interaction between auditory and motor areas of the brain, and the importance of auditory information for movement execution, control, and learning. In applied research, artificially-produced acoustic information and real-time auditory information have been implemented in sports and rehabilitation to improve motor performance in athletes, healthy individuals, and patients affected by neurological or movement disorders. However, this research is scattered both across time and scientific disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview about the interaction between movement and sound and review the current literature regarding the effect of natural movement sounds, movement sonification, and rhythmic auditory information in sports and motor rehabilitation. The focus here is threefold: firstly, we provide an overview of empirical studies using natural movement sounds and movement sonification in sports. Secondly, we review recent clinical and applied studies using rhythmic auditory information and sonification in rehabilitation, addressing in particular studies on Parkinson's disease and stroke. Thirdly, we summarize current evidence regarding the cognitive mechanisms and neural correlates underlying the processing of auditory information during movement execution and its mental representation. The current state of knowledge here reviewed provides evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of auditory information to improve movement execution, control, and (re)learning in sports and motor rehabilitation. Findings also corroborate the critical role of auditory information in auditory-motor coupling during motor (re)learning and performance, suggesting that this area of clinical and applied research has a large potential that is yet to be fully explored."

Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in our scientific understanding of SRC, which in turn has driven the development of clinical guidelines for diagnosis, assessment, and management of SRC. In addition to a growing need for knowledgeable health care professionals to provide evidence-based care for athletes with SRC, media attention and legislation have created awareness and, in some cases, fear about many issues and unknowns surrounding SRC. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine formed a writing group to review the existing literature on SRC, update its previous position statement, and address current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding SRC. The absence of definitive outcomes-based data is challenging and requires relying on the best available evidence integrated with clinical experience and patient values. This statement reviews the definition, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of SRC, the diagnosis and management of both acute and persistent concussion symptoms, the short- and long-term risks of SRC and repetitive head impact exposure, SRC prevention strategies, and potential future directions for SRC research.

Thirty-eight physically active males (mean age: 21.8 ± 2.5 years) participated. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 PJT groups or a control (CON, n = 9) according to their jump performance. Plyometric jump training was conducted at maximal (PJT-100, n = 10), high (PJT-80, n = 9), or moderate (PJT-65, n = 10) intensity within each group. Baseline and follow-up tests were performed for the assessment of countermovement jump (CMJ) height, CMJ height with arm swing (CMJA), and drop jump height from a 20-cm drop box (DJ20), linear speed (30 m), and change-of-direction speed (CODS) (the Illinois CODS test). Results revealed significant group × time interactions for CMJ, CMJA, DJ20, 30-m sprint, and CODS (all p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.39–0.76). Post hoc analyses showed significant improvements in all 5 fitness measures for PJT-100 (all p &lt; 0.01, Δ3.7–13.5%, d = 0.26–1.4). For PJT-80, 3 of 5 fitness tests demonstrated significant change (CMJ: p &lt; 0.001, Δ5.9%, d = 0.33; CMJA: p &lt; 0.001, Δ7.0%, d = 0.43; CODS: p &lt; 0.001, Δ3.9%, d = 0.9), and for PJT-65, only 1 test was significant (CMJ: p &lt; 0.05, Δ2.8%, d = 0.15). No significant changes were observed in CON. Except for similar gains in DJ20 and 30-m sprint in PJT-100 and PJT-80, gains in physical fitness were, in general, greater ( p &lt; 0.05) after PJT-100 vs. PJT-80 vs. PJT-65 vs. CON. Therefore, maximal PJT intensity may induce larger physical fitness gains, although high and moderate intensities may also be useful, but to a lesser extent."

Resistance training practices of sprint coaches. J Strength Cond Res 35(7): 1939–1948, 2021—This study describes the results of a survey of resistance training practices of sprint coaches. This study investigated why sprint coaches prescribe resistance training to their athletes, what exercises they select, and what factors are involved with their selection. Forty-one of 73 (56%) sprint coaches with mean ± SD coaching experience of 8.4 ± 6.4 years were included in this study. Coaches completed an online questionnaire consisting of 5 sections: (a) informed consent, (b) coach background information, (c) coach education and qualifications, (d) coaches' views on resistance training, and (e) exercise selection and preference. The results showed that coaches prescribe resistance training to their sprint athletes to develop strength and power, which they believe will transfer to sprint performance. Coaches prescribed a wide variety of traditional, ballistic, and plyometric exercises, with the hurdle jump found to be the most widely prescribed exercise (93% of coaches surveyed). Coaches selected exercises for a variety of reasons; however, the 3 most prominent reasons were: (a) performance adaptations; (b) practicality; and (c) the targeting of muscles/muscle groups. Coaches prioritized exercises that specifically developed strength, power, and reactive strength for their sprint athletes. This research can be used to develop educational resources for sprint coaches who wish to use resistance training with their athletes. In addition, sprint coaches can use the data presented to expand their current exercise repertoire and resistance training practices."

Decreased ankle DF range of motion can lead to an increase in lower-extremity injuries, for example, acute ankle sprains, Achilles tendinopathy. Objective : The purpose of this study was to determine whether a single application of the intervention to the gastrocnemius/soleus complex via multidirectional self-myofascial release using a foam roller, multiplanar dynamic stretch performed in downward dog, or a combination of both techniques acutely improved ankle DF. Design : Subjects were assigned to groups via random card selection. Investigators provided verbal cues as needed to yield correct performance of interventions. Both interventions were performed twice for 1 minute using a dynamic walking rest of 30.48 m at a self-selected pace between interventions. Statistical analyses were completed using a 1-way analysis of variance, at α level ≤ .05. Setting : A convenience sample study. Participants : A total of 42 asymptomatic physical therapy students (18 females and 24 males) with mean age of 26.12 (4.03) years volunteered to participate. Interventions : Multidirectional self-myofascial release using a foam roller, multiplanar dynamic stretch performed in downward dog, or a combination of both techniques. Main Outcome Measures : Weight-bearing right ankle DF measurements were recorded in centimeters using a forward lunge technique (intraclass correlation coefficient = .98, .97, and .96). Results : Data analysis revealed no significant difference between the 3 groups in all pre–post measurements ( P = .82). Mean (SD) measurements from pretest to posttest for myofascial release, dynamic stretching, and combination interventions were 0.479 (0.7) cm, 0.700 (0.7) cm, and 0.907 (1.4) cm, respectively. Conclusion : Until further studies are conducted, the selection of technique to increase ankle DF range of motion should be based on each individual patient’s ability, preference, and response to treatment."

Individualized and fixed thresholds to demarcate PlayerLoad intensity zones produce different outcomes. J Strength Cond Res 35(7): 2046-2052, 2021-Individualized approaches to derive intensity zones are yet to be examined using microsensor metrics in basketball. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the time spent in different PlayerLoad intensity zones using individualized and fixed approaches during basketball training. Thirteen semiprofessional, male basketball players were monitored across the preparatory training phase. Microsensors recorded the time spent in 6 PlayerLoad intensity zones using individualized and fixed approaches. Individualized zones were calculated relative to the peak instantaneous PlayerLoad response observed in each player across training. Fixed zones were determined following predefined cut-points set in proprietary software. The majority of training time was spent in zones 1-2 (98-99%), with a low proportion of time detected in zones 3-6 (1-2%) across approaches. The fixed approach produced greater training time in zones 2 (11.9 ± 1.2 vs. 9.3 ± 2.4 minutes; very likely large) and 3 (1.7 ± 0.8 vs. 0.8 ± 0.9 minutes; very likely moderate), was an unclear small increase in time spent in zone 1 were apparent using individualized thresholds (76.5 ± 11.2 vs. 72.9 ± 9.6 minutes). Almost certain similar time was spent in zones 4-6 across approaches. Individual analyses showed deviations across players; however, fixed PlayerLoad thresholds produced higher training time in zones 2 (moderate to very large), 3 (moderate to very large), 4 (moderate to large), and 5 (moderate) than the individualized approach in most players. Variations in outcomes between individualized and fixed approaches must be considered when quantifying the time spent working in PlayerLoad intensity zones."

The aim of this study was to compare the complex geometry, and unique ultrastructure and tissue composition of the meniscus in healthy (control) and pathological conditions to provide understanding of structural changes that could be helpful in the future design of targetted therapies and improvement of treatment indications. We analyzed meniscus samples collected from 3 healthy multi-organ donors (median age, 66 years), 5 patients with traumatic meniscal tear (median age, 41 years) and 3 patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) for end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) (median age, 72 years). We evaluated the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, the appearance and distribution of areas of calcification, and modifications of cellular organization and structure by electron microscopy and histology. The ECM structure was similar in specimens from traumatic meniscus tears compared to those from patients with late-stage OA, showing disorganization of collagen fibers and increased proteoglycan content. Cells of healthy menisci showed mainly diffuse chromatin and well preserved organelles. Both in traumatic and in OA menisci, we observed increased chromatin condensation, organelle degeneration, and cytoplasmic vacuolization, a portion of which contained markers of autophagic vacuoles. Areas of calcification were also observed in both traumatic and OA menisci, as well as apoptotic-like features that were particularly prominent in traumatic meniscal tear samples. We conclude that meniscal tissue from patients with traumatic meniscal injury demonstrate pathological alterations characteristic of tissue from older patients undergoing TKR, suggesting that they have high susceptibility to develop OA."

Many approaches have been developed, among which value-based health care (VBHC) is one of the most promising: value is given by outcomes achieved per dollar spent. Best value is given by shared benefits between all the stakeholders involved in the process: patients, providers, suppliers, payers and citizens. However, VBHC implementation is a current challenge for hospitals and healthcare providers, that may find it difficult to adapt their organization into a patient-centered clinical pathway based on both classical outcomes and innovative patient-evaluation. If any contribution to improve cost-effectiveness over the full cycle of care is welcome, laboratory medicine is achieving increasing importance, by generating useful knowledge to reduce costs and improve patient care, provided by a biunivocal relationship with clinicians. On the one hand, pathologists have to emphasize the importance of laboratory data to improve diagnostic and prognostic traditional thinking. On the other hand, the same data are useful only when supported by strong evidence. Introducing laboratory medicine professionals to VBHC would be useful to achieve better skills on data outline, comparable methodologies, quality control, cost assessment, multidisciplinary coordination and patient-specific procedures."

https://openalex.org/W2913088983,Meniscus Tears and Review of the Literature,2019-02-08,2019,book-chapter,"The knee joint is the largest and most complicated joint in the human body. Bone structures, capsules, menisci, and ligaments provide static stability in the knee joint and are responsible for dynamic stabilization of the muscles and tendons. Menisci are fibrocartilage structures that cover two-thirds of the tibial plateau joint surface. The main functions of the meniscus are load sharing and loading of the tibiofemoral joint, shock absorption, helping to feed the cartilage by facilitating dissociation of the joint fluid, and contributing to the joint fit by increasing joint stability and joint contact surface area. Menisci are frequently injured structures. The incidence of acute meniscal tears is 60 per 100,000. It is more common in males. Trauma-related tears are common in patients under 30 years of age, whereas degenerative complex tears increase in patients over 30 years of age. There may not be a significant trauma story, especially in degenerative meniscus tears. They are sports traumas that come to the fore in the etiology of meniscus tears. It is the football that has the greatest risk of creating a meniscus lesion, followed by athletics, American football, and skiing. There is an indication for repair in peripheral ruptures where blood flow is excessive. In the central rupture where blood is not present, the treatment is meniscectomy. In this review, we compiled the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment methods of the meniscal tears."

Objective To identify gaps and factors influencing concussion knowledge for high school athletics. Design Survey. Setting Public, private, and recreational leagues in New Jersey. Participants 41 coaches, 34 ATCs, and 65 parents of high school student‐athletes. Methods A 17‐item online survey examining concussion knowledge was distributed to coaches, ATCs, and parents. Analyses included ANOVA for between‐group comparisons of continuous variables and Pearson's correlations for categorical data. Main Outcome Measurements Demographics, concussion knowledge, application of knowledge, access to educational materials, and confidence in the ability to identify concussions. Results Significant between‐group differences were found for overall knowledge (F[2137] = 11.0, P &lt; .001), factual knowledge (F[2137] = 8.7, P &lt; .001), and application of knowledge (F[2137] = 3.5, P = .03), with parents scoring lower.

Understanding alterations associated with these pathologies will provide greater insight into developing and optimising patient-specific treatments. A number of biomechanical and neuromuscular impairment are associated with Femoracetabular impingement (FAI), gluteal tendinopathy (GT) and hip osteoarthritis (OA) conditions including but not limited to muscle weakness, altered postural control, restricted range of motion and altered tendon/joint loading. These alterations can present differently in sub-groups of patients and result directly from the pathological process and/or indirectly from pain and its consequences (e.g. reduced activity). These impairments are often targets for conservative interventions but there is currently little clinical trial evidence to show that treatments can modify these impairments. Clinical trial evidence does, however, support conservative treatment options for each of the pathologies reviewed. Clinical outcome tools used to evaluate the effects of treatment and track change over time are recommended."

All participants were players of two distinct clubs and were undertaking different training routines, as planned by their technical staff members. For this purpose, the soccer players performed: (1) squat and countermovement jumps; (2) a maximal 20-m linear sprint speed test, and (3) the Zigzag COD test. The magnitude-based inference approach and standardized differences were used to compare the age-groups. Sprint speed at longer distances (20-m) increased progressively across the age-ranges. In contrast, speed and acceleration performances at shorter distances (5-m) were better in U15 than in the other age-categories. The COD speed did not change throughout the younger categories but presented a meaningful decrease in the Senior category. Surprisingly, despite the progressive increase in volume and intensity of neuromuscular training from younger to older categories, the COD deficit presented a gradual increase across the age-groups. It is possible that simple modulation of the strength-power training program during the maturation process is not sufficient to produce faster adult players with enhanced ability to change direction. Therefore, coaches are strongly encouraged to implement specific COD training practices to tolerate braking at increasing running speeds and appropriate volume and intensity of soccer specific training throughout the players' specialization process."

A model of the netball match performance system was produced showing the interrelated objects, processes, functions, values, and purposes involved in elite level netball matches. The model identified the components of elite level netball performance and the interactions and relationships between them. The output of this research has identified novel PA measures including passing and possession measures, measures of cognitive performance, and measures related to physical activity.

Postural adaptation involves specific sensorimotor processes integrating visual information and somesthesic information. The objective of this study was to examine this multisensorial integration on postural control, especially the use of visual and plantar information in static (stable) and dynamic (unstable) postures, among a group of expert horse rider women (n = 10) and a group of non-athlete women (n = 12). Postural control was evaluated through the center of pressure measured with a force platform on stable and unstable supports, with the eyes open and the eyes closed, and with the presence of foam on the support or not. Results showed that expert horse rider women had a better postural stability with unstable support in the mediolateral axis compared to non-athletes. Moreover, on the anteroposterior axis, expert horse riders were less visual dependent and more stable in the presence of foam. Results suggested that horseback riding could help developing particular proprioceptive abilities on standing posture as well as better postural muscle tone during particular bipodal dynamic perturbations. These outcomes provide new insights into horseback riding assets and methodological clues to assess the impact of sport practice."

However, whether this pattern is observable in different sports and with different variables, like perceptual performance, still needs to be tested. Therefore, we investigated if long-term sports participation might modify the motor and perceptual performance asymmetries of arms in water polo players. It was hypothesized that water polo players would perform with less interlimb asymmetry in comparison to nonathletes.Right-handed water polo players and nonathletes were tested on motor performance for both arms during a reaching task. Thirteen water polo players and thirteen nonathletes performed reaching movements under two experimental conditions: (a) right arm and (b) left arm. Velocity, accuracy, hand path deviation from linearity, and reaction time were calculated for each trial and for both arms. The potential interlimb differences in movement performance could be assessed by testing.Consistent with the hypothesis, our findings showed that water polo players displayed substantially less asymmetry in the performance of accuracy and reaction time.These findings suggest that performance asymmetries of arms can be altered via intense long-term practice."

Elderly adults are particularly dependent on vision to maintain postural stability. Distinct changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters are associated with aging, such as slower gait and increased gait variability, which are amplified with exposure to visual perturbations. Increased gait variability, specifically with mediolateral perturbations, poses a particular challenge for elderly adults and is linked to increased falls risk.

The injury rate was higher in college than in high school (3.20 versus 0.98/1000 AEs; IRR = 3.27; 95% CI = 3.07, 3.49). The competition injury rate was higher than the practice injury rate in high school (IRR = 2.27; 95% CI = 2.05, 2.51) and college (IRR = 2.32; 95% CI = 2.15, 2.51). Baseball players at the high school and collegiate levels sustained a variety of injuries across the body, with the most common injuries reported to the upper extremity. Many injuries also occurred while fielding or pitching. Conclusions Injury rates were greater in collegiate versus high school baseball and in competition versus practice. These findings highlight the need for injury-prevention interventions focused on reducing the incidence of upper extremity injuries and protecting batters from pitches and fielders from batted balls."

However, there is no consensus on the efficacy or safety of these training methods. Hypothesis: This systematic review was intended to answer the following questions: Does weighted-ball training improve pitching velocity? Does weighted-ball training increase the risk of injury? Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Searches were conducted with MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ProQuest Physical Education Index. Articles were included if the study population consisted of adult, adolescent, or youth baseball pitchers training with under- or overweight baseballs, with velocity as a measured outcome. Articles were excluded if they were review articles, examined sports other than baseball, utilized weighted implements other than baseballs, or were not published in peer-reviewed journals. Included articles were at least level 4 evidence. Data extracted for qualitative analysis included training protocol parameters (such as ball weight, number of pitches, duration of training), velocity change, and injuries or complications reported. Results: A total of 4119 article titles were retrieved, of which 156 were selected for abstract review. After manual removal of duplicates, 128 abstracts were reviewed. Of these, 17 met the inclusion criteria, and the full text was obtained. After full-text review, 7 additional articles were excluded, leaving 10 articles that met inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. Conclusion: Weighted-implement training increased pitching velocity in the majority of the included studies. However, the quality of available evidence was determined to be very poor, and there was marked heterogeneity in training protocols, ball weights, and study populations. There was inadequate evidence reported to determine the risk of injury with this type of training."

MPFL reconstruction (MPFL-R) restores stability and functionality to the patellofemoral joint and has emerged as a preferred treatment option for recurrent lateral patellar instability.To objectively measure biomechanical characteristics of athletes cleared for return to sport after MPFL-R compared with healthy controls.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.A prospective case-control study design was employed on 31 total athletes. Sixteen athletes (6 male, 10 female; mean age, 16.1 ± 2.74 years; 385 ± 189 days after surgery and 235 ± 157 days after return to sport) underwent MPFL-R and were medically cleared to return to sport. This group was matched by age, sex, and activity level to 15 healthy athletes with no history of lower extremity injuries. Athletes and controls completed validated questionnaires as well as hopping, jumping, and cutting tests with 3-dimensional motion analysis and underwent strength, flexibility, laxity, and balance assessments.Participants in the MPFL-R group scored significantly lower (worse) on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) (89.2 ± 7.6 vs 98.1 ± 2.0, respectively; P = .0005) and significantly higher (worse) on the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) (32.4 ± 5.0 vs 25.4 ± 6.5, respectively; P = .006) than those in the control group, but there was no difference in the Kujala score (95.6 ± 5.3 vs 98.8 ± 3.0, respectively; P = .06). Participants in the MPFL-R group demonstrated reduced hip and ankle flexion relative to those in the control group (P < .05). Participants in the MPFL-R group also took significantly longer to complete the 6-m timed hop test relative to those in the control group (P < .05). No statistically significant differences were found in anthropometrics, knee extension or flexion strength, hamstring flexibility, hip abduction strength, or joint laxity between the MPFL-R and control groups.The current data indicate that MPFL-R generally restores functional symmetry, while subtle deficits in global power may remain after being released to full activity. Clinicians should ensure that athletes are fully rehabilitated before returning to sport after MPFL-R by emphasizing functional multijoint exercises."

Although several risk factors have been proposed, the association between the playing surface and development of fifth metatarsal stress fractures (MT-5) has not been evaluated. We conducted an epidemiological study using a computer-based survey to investigate the association between the playing surface and development of MT-5.This study included 1854 football players, of which 41 experienced MT-5 within the past 24 months. Baseline demographic data and the percentage of time spent playing on artificial turf and clay fields were compared between the non-MT-5 and MT-5 player groups, and the risks for development of MT-5 associated with the playing surfaces were estimated by univariate and multivariate analyses.There were significant differences in body mass index, years of play, playing categories and playing time on artificial turf between non-MT-5 and MT-5 groups (p<0.05). Generalised estimating equations analyses adjusted for multiple confounders demonstrated that relative to the risk of playing <20% of the time on each surface, the OR (OR: 95% CI) for MT-5 for playing on artificial turf >80% of the time increased (3.44: 1.65 to 7.18), and for playing on a clay field 61%-80% of the time, the OR decreased (0.25: 0.11 to 0.59).A higher percentage of playing time on an artificial turf was a risk factor for developing MT-5 in football players. This finding could be beneficial for creating strategies to prevent MT-5."

We extracted data on patient demographics, PROs and the results of five tests of muscle function from a rehabilitation-specific register. Athletes were 15-30 years of age, involved in knee-strenuous sport and had undergone a primary ACL reconstruction. The primary outcome was achieving a Limb Symmetry Index of ≥90% for the battery of tests 1 year after ACL reconstruction. Patient demographics, muscle-function data and results for PROs at the 4-month follow-up were analysed. In all, 237 athletes (59% female; mean age 22±4 years) were included in the study. One year after ACL reconstruction, 26% (62/237) of the included athletes had achieved symmetrical muscle function. Univariable analysis showed that symmetrical muscle function was associated with present self-efficacy, OR 1.28 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.58, p=0.011), knee-extension strength, OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.34), knee-flexion strength, OR 1.39 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.81), vertical hop, OR 1.77 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.45), single-leg hop for distance, OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.24 to 3.17) and side hop, OR 1.64 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.33). Symmetrical knee-extension and knee-flexion strength, a more symmetrical hop performance and higher present self-efficacy at an early stage all increased the odds of achieving symmetrical muscle function in young athletes 1 year after ACL reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2915264038,Bi-exponential modeling derives novel parameters for the critical speed concept,2019-02-01,2019,article,"All-out exercise testing (AOT) has emerged as a method for quantifying critical speed (CS) and the curvature constant (D'). The AOT method was recently validated for shuttle running yet how that method compares with linear running is unknown. In the present study, we utilized a novel bi-exponential model that derives CS and D' with additional new parameters from the AOT method. Fourteen male athletes (age = 21.6 ± 2.2 years; height = 177 ± 70 cm; weight = 83.0 ± 11.8 kg) completed a graded exercise test (GXT) to derive maximum oxygen uptake ( V˙O2max ) and the average speed between gas exchange threshold and V˙O2max (sΔ50%), a linear AOT, and two shuttle AOTs. Measurement agreement was determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC α ), typical error (TE), and coefficient of variation (CV). The y-asymptote ( S0 ) of the speed-time curve (3.52 ± 0.66 m·sec-1 ) did not differ from sΔ50% (3.49 ± 0.41 m·sec-1 ) or CS (3.77 ± 0.56 m·sec-1 ) (P = 0.34). Strong agreement was observed for estimates of CS (ICC α = 0.92, TE = 0.18 m·sec-1 , and CV = 5.7%) and D' (ICC α = 0.94, TE = 16.0 m, CV = 7.6%) with significant (P < 0.01) correlations observed between V˙O2max and CS and between S0 and V˙O2max (r values of 0.74 and 0.84, respectively). The time constant of the decay in speed ( τd ) and the amplitude between maximal speed and S0 ( Ad ) emerged as unique metrics. The Ad and τd metrics may glean new insights for prescribing and interpreting high-intensity exercise using the AOT method."

These symptoms include emotional, behavioural, cognitive and physical symptoms and can lead to considerable disability. The neurobiological underpinnings of PCS are poorly understood, limiting potential clinical interventions. As such, patients and families frequently re-present to clinical services, who are often ill equipped to address the multifactorial nature of PCS. This contributes to the high cost of concussion management and the disability of children experiencing PCS. The aims of the present study are: (1) to plot and contrast recovery pathways for children with concussion from time of injury to 3 months postinjury, (ii) evaluate the contribution of acute biomarkers (ie, blood, MRI) to delayed recovery postconcussion and (3) estimate financial costs of child concussion to patients attending the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary children’s hospital and factors predicting high cost. Methods and analysis Take C.A.Re is a prospective, longitudinal study at a tertiary children’s hospital, recruiting and assessing 525 patients aged 5–&lt;18 years (400 concussion, 125 orthopaedic injury) who present to the ED with a concussion and following them at 1–4 days, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months postinjury. Multiple domains are assessed: preinjury and postinjury, clinical, MRI, blood samples, neuropsychological, psychological and economic. PCS is defined as the presence of ≥2 symptoms on the Post Concussive Symptoms Inventory rated as worse compared with baseline 1 month postinjury. Main analyses comprise longitudinal Generalised Estimating Equation models and regression analyses of predictors of recovery and factors predicting high economic costs. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained through the Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (33122). We aim to disseminate the findings through international conferences, international peer-reviewed journals and social media. Trial registration number ACTRN12615000316505; Results."
https://openalex.org/W2921788492,A review on aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in sports,2019-02-01,2019,review,"Aero/hydrodynamics plays a vital role in speed sports (athletes, athletes' outfits, sports balls, sports equipment, etc.). Sports balls (spherical - golf, cricket, tennis, soccer, baseball, softball, etc. and oval shape - rugby, American football, Australian football), sports garments (swimsuits, ski jumping & alpine skiing suits, cycling skin suits, skating suits) are affected by aerodynamic and hydrodynamic behavior of fluids (air and liquids). The aero/hydrodynamics dictates the curved flight path of a soccer, tennis, cricket, baseball or golf ball and the course of a surfboard and sailboat through water. It affects speed, motion (position and placement) and ultimately athlete's performance. Ignoring the effect of aerodynamic and hydrodynamics, it is almost impossible to achieve the desired success in any competitive speed sports. Due to stiff competition, the outcome of most sports aero/hydrodynamics research work undertaken by commercial organizations as well as individual sports teams/organizations are kept in-house, and scant information is available in the public domain. The RMIT University's Sports Aerodynamics Research Group has been active in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics research related to some popular speed sports.

The goal of this study is to examine the use of core training as a preventative tool. We performed a non-randomized prospective study involving high school athletes. They participated in a 10-week training session with exercises focused on increasing core strength [mobility, agility, stability, strength and flexibility (MASSf)]. Logs were kept of all concussions diagnosed using ImPACT concussion testing. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square to calculate expected/observed frequency and Chi-squared test statistic, χ 2 . Test significance was accepted at a P 2 =9.84, corresponds to a P value of 0.0017. The MASSf program was repeated in the 2015 season with 2 concussions in 121 participants. Our study showed a statistically significant decrease in concussion rates after participating in MASSf training. This program shows a promise as a primary prevention method to reduce sports related concussions."
https://openalex.org/W2801185793,Switching between pitch surfaces: practical applications and future perspectives for soccer training,2019-02-01,2019,review,"Soccer training and completion is conventionally practiced on natural grass (NG) or artificial turf (AT). Recently, AT pitches for training / competition, and of unstable surfaces for injury prevention training has increased. Therefore, soccer players are frequently exposed to variations in pitch surface during either training or competition. These ground changes may impact physical and physiological responses, adaptations as well as the injury. The aim of this review was to summarize the acute physical and physiological responses, chronic adaptations, and injury risk associated with exercising on different pitch surfaces in soccer. Eligible studies were published in English, had pitch surface as an independent variable, and had physical, physiological or epidemiological information as outcome variables. Specific data extracted from the articles included the training response, training adaptations or injury outcomes according to different pitch surfaces. A total of 224 studies were retrieved from a literature search. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria: 9 for acute physical and physiological responses, 2 for training adaptations and 9 for injury assessment. The literature lacks consistent evidence regarding the effects of pitch surface on performance and health outcomes in soccer players. However, it seems that occasionally switching training surfaces seems a valuable strategy for focusing on specific musculoskeletal queries and enhancing players' fitness. For instance, sand training may be occasionally proposed as complementary training strategy, given the recruitment of additional musculature probably not involved on firmer surfaces, but the possible training-induced adaptations of non-conventional soccer surfaces (e.g., sand) might potentially result into a negative transfer on AT or NG. Since the specific physical demands of soccer can differ between surfaces, coaches should resort to the use of non-traditional surfaces with parsimony, emphasizing the specific surface-related motor tasks, normally observed on natural grass or artificial turf. Further studies are required to better understand the physiological effects induced by systematic surface-specific training, or switching between pitch surfaces."

A generalized model with three Maxwell elements is considered to describe the viscoelastic behavior. An analytical method based on Laplace transformation is used to solve the impact problem. To have a comprehensive understanding of viscoelastic material response, drop-weight impact is also considered in this study. For both linear impact and drop-weight cases, a maximum reduction of 15% of the impact force as well as 32% higher energy absorption can be achieved with the increase in tan δ from 0.01 to 0.8 of viscoelastic material. In addition, for linear impact, impact force decreases by 20% when tan δ = 1. With the increase in tan δ, storage modulus decreases by around 57% for maintaining a predetermined deformation. Moreover, for almost constant maximum displacement, materials with a higher storage modulus absorb more impact energy and experience higher impact force as compared to materials with a lower storage modulus."

However, very few studies have analyzed the role of multistation exercises to improve these variables. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a six-week multistation exercise program on knee joint position sense (JPS) and countermovement jump (CMJ) of futsal players.Thirty-four male futsal players randomly classified into experimental (N.=17) or control group (N.=17). The experimental group included a multistation exercise protocol to their training routines (2 times/week - 6 weeks); the control group continued their training routines. All the players completed similar training routines outside of the multistation exercises. Before (baseline), just after the intervention (Post6Wk) and four weeks later (Post10Wk), CMJ and knee JPS (absolute, relative and variable angular error: AAE, RAE and VAE, respectively) were evaluated.ANOVA showed that the experimental group significantly decreased VAE at Post10Wk compared to baseline, suggestive of greater proprioceptive precision, while the control group significantly increased AAE, RAE and VAE at Post10Wk compared to baseline. The experimental group exhibited lower and thus, better AAE and VAE than the control group at Post10Wk, although no significant differences were found at Post6Wk. No significant differences was found in the CMJ.A six weeks of multistation program may help improve proprioceptive precision of futsal players, even one month after finishing the 6-wk multistation training program. However, this is not long enough to improve proprioceptive acuity and maximum vertical jump. Therefore, the meaningful of these results in term of performance are unclear."

This technique makes it possible (I) to mimic internal fiber orientation inside the ACL, (II) to maximize the graft-tunnel wall contact. Our follow-up study showed that 95% of the patients restored satisfactory stability of the knee with normal motion maintained without extra-articular tenodesis or reconstruction of the anterolateral structures. ART ACLR with a BTB graft can stabilize the knee without loss of motion by closely mimicking the native ACL."

The-study, hence, recommended: (i) Further-studies, to-optimize the-dimensions of the-device, to-accommodate different-shapes of calf-muscles; (ii) More-advanced-methods, such-as PuCC; AHP, and TRIZ should be considered in-selection of the-best-design-alternative; (iii) Comprehensive-materials-selection should be detailed via Ashby-charts; (iv) To-carry-out a-detail-design; (v) To-fabricate a-prototype; (vi) To-conduct additional-tests (e.g., FEA/FEM) and explorative-use-ability-trials, in-collaboration-with the-department of Medical-Engineering, School of Medicine, MU; and (vii) To-analyze the-marketing-aspect of the-final-device. The-device is potentially-beneficial to sports-health-care-providers, coaches, and athletes; moreover, it could be included into-First-Aid Sport-kit (subject-to satisfactory-trails).

https://openalex.org/W3210874911,American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport,2019-01-31,2019,article,"Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a common injury in recreational and organised sport. Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in our scientific understanding of SRC, which in turn has driven the development of clinical guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and management of SRC. In addition to a growing need for knowledgeable healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based care for athletes with SRC, media attention and legislation have created awareness and, in some cases, fear about many issues and unknowns surrounding SRC. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) formed a writing group to review the existing literature on SRC, update its previous position statement, and to address current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding SRC. The absence of definitive outcomes-based data is challenging and requires relying on the best available evidence integrated with clinical experience and patient values. This statement reviews the definition, pathophysiology and epidemiology of SRC, the diagnosis and management of both acute and persistent concussion symptoms, the short-term and long-term risks of SRC and repetitive head impact exposure, SRC prevention strategies, and potential future directions for SRC research. The AMSSM is committed to best clinical practices, evidence-based research and educational initiatives that positively impact the health and safety of athletes."
