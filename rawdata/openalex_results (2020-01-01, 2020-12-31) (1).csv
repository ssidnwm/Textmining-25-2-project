https://openalex.org/W3120674672,Concussion knowledge and attitudes amongst competitive cyclists,2020-12-31,2020,article,"The purpose of this study was to examine the concussion knowledge and attitudes of UK competitive road cyclists to identify gaps in knowledge and assess attitudes. This was a cross-sectional study using 118 UK competitive cyclists, spanning a range of ages and abilities. An adapted Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitudes Survey (RoCKAS) was administered to the participants. The RoCKAS contained separate knowledge and attitude sections (possible scores ranged from 0-33 and 15-75, respectively). A cohort analysis was conducted to examine for differences in attitudes amongst the participants. The mean score for concussion knowledge was 26.4 ± 4.12 and 63.1 ± 6.4 for concussion attitude. Statistically significant differences were found in attitudes between the 49-58 age group and the 19-28 age group (p=0.013). Significant differences were also found between competitive cyclists and recreational cyclists who trained but did not race. The results of this study suggest that UK competitive cyclists have moderate concussion knowledge and good concussion symptom recognition. A cohort analysis shows that youth are less concerned about concussion than older participants and higher ability groups were associated with more dangerous attitudes. These findings can help inform targeted educational interventions in cycling to improve concussion awareness, reporting behaviors, and concussion management behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W3115606196,Effects of acute wearable resistance loading on overground running lower body kinematics,2020-12-28,2020,article,"Field-based sports require athletes to run sub-maximally over significant distances, often while contending with dynamic perturbations to preferred coordination patterns. The ability to adapt movement to maintain performance under such perturbations appears to be trainable through exposure to task variability, which encourages movement variability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which various wearable resistance loading magnitudes alter coordination and induce movement variability during running. To investigate this, 14 participants (three female and 11 male) performed 10 sub-maximal velocity shuttle runs with either no weight, 1%, 3%, or 5% of body weight attached to the lower limbs. Sagittal plane lower limb joint kinematics from one complete stride cycle in each run were assessed using functional data analysis techniques, both across the participant group and within-individuals. At the group-level, decreases in ankle plantarflexion following toe-off were evident in the 3% and 5% conditions, while increased knee flexion occurred during weight acceptance in the 5% condition compared with unloaded running. At the individual-level, between-run joint angle profiles varied, with six participants exhibiting increased joint angle variability in one or more loading conditions compared with unloaded running. Loading of 5% decreased between-run ankle joint variability among two individuals, likely in accordance with the need to manage increased system load or the novelty of the task. In terms of joint coordination, the most considerable alterations to coordination occurred in the 5% loading condition at the hip-knee joint pair, however, only a minority of participants exhibited this tendency. Coaches should prescribe wearable resistance individually to perturb preferred coordination patterns and encourage movement variability without loading to the extent that movement options become limited."

Design A 1-year prospective cohort study. Methods Two hundred twenty-four recreational runners (average weekly running distance for the past 12 months, 15 km) were included (89 women, 135 men). Pain information was reported weekly for 1 year, and all running-related injuries that resulted in time loss or medical consultation were recorded. We accounted for censoring when calculating cumulative incidence proportion, and used crude Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate whether the variables of interest were associated with running-related injuries. Results The 1-year cumulative incidence proportion of running-related injuries was 45.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.4%, 54.2%). The most common anatomical locations were the knee (20/75, 27%) and Achilles tendon/calf (19/75, 25%). Previous injury was associated with a higher injury rate (hazard rate ratio = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.2), while the other variables had no statistically significant association with injury. Conclusion There were 75 running-related injuries during the 1-year surveillance period, for a cumulative incidence proportion of 46%.

A reliable and objective solution that can fulfil this task would be deeply important for two main reasons: (i) it would grant an objective indicator to adjust the daily training load for each player and (ii) it would provide an innovative tool to reduce the risk of fatigue-related injuries. Available solutions for objectively quantifying the fatigue level of fatigue can be invasive for the athlete; they could alter the performance or they are not compatible with daily practice on the playground. Building on previous findings that identified fatigue-related parameters in the kinematic of the counter-movement jump (CMJ), this study evaluates the physical response to a fatigue protocol (i.e., Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1) in 16 football referees, by monitoring CMJ performance with wearable magneto-inertial measurement units (MIMU). Nineteen kinematic parameters were selected as suitable indicators for fatigue detection. The analysis of their variations allowed us to distinguish two opposites but coherent responses to the fatigue protocol. Indeed, eight out of sixteen athletes showed reduced performance (e.g., an effective fatigue condition), while the other eight athletes experienced an improvement of the execution likely due to the so-called Post-Activation Potentiation. In both cases, the above parameters were significantly influenced by the fatigue protocol (p &lt; 0.05), confirming their validity for fatigue monitoring. Interesting correlations between several kinematic parameters and muscular mass were highlighted in the fatigued group. Finally, a “fatigue approximation index” was proposed and validated as fatigue quantifier."

Methods: 20 participants (10 non-cyclists, 10 cyclists-triathletes) performed two 30 min self-paced cycling time-trials (TT, ∼5–7 days apart) with either a single feedback (elapsed time) or multiple feedback (power output, elapsed distance, elapsed time, cadence, speed, and heart rate). Cyclists-triathlete’s information acquisition was also monitored during the multiple feedback trial via an eye tracker. Perceptual measurements of task motivation, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and affect were collected every 5 min. Performance variables (power output, cadence, distance, speed) and heart rate were recorded continuously. Results: Cyclists-triathletes average power output was greater compared to non-cyclists with both multiple feedback (227.99 ± 42.02 W; 137.27 ± 27.63 W ; P &amp;lt; 0.05) and single feedback (287.9 ± 60.07 W; 131.13 ± 25.53 W).

Previous studies suggest that the prophylactic use of laser has ergogenic effects on athletic performance by increasing the contractile function of skeletal muscles. Recently, muscle function improvement is a new research idea in the field of laser therapy. Based on our knowledge, there are only two studies on the effects of HPL on muscle performance although with contradictory results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of HPL on quadriceps muscle performance in male football players.Materials and Methods: Sixteen healthy male football players (Mean±SD age=18.53±7.2 years, Mean±SD body mass index=22.8±4.4 kg/m2) participated in a pretest-posttest study. The subjects received one session of HPL (808 nm, 80 j, 2 w) on quadriceps muscles. The Isometric Peak Torque (IPT), Single-Leg Hop Test (SLHT), and Y-balance Test (YBT) were measured at baseline and immediately after HPL. For statistical analysis, we used the paired sample t test.Results: Immediately after HPL, the IPT (P=0.001), SLHT (P=0.02), and YBT scores (P=0.001) significantly increased.Conclusion: The results of our study showed that immediate application of one session of HPL can improve IPT as well as functional tests. Although the sessions of laser application and assessment were limited and the sample size was small, it seems that HPL could improve muscle performance. Therefore, further research is warranted with large sample size and follow-up."

Despite the growing popularity of ultimate worldwide, there is limited information about the epidemiology of injury in the sport. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of the literature on the epidemiology of injury in ultimate. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted in five electronic databases (i.e., MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, SPORTDiscus, and AusportMed). All databases were searched from inception to 1 July 2020. A total of eleven studies were included and qualitatively synthesized. Injury incidence rate estimates ranged from 0.4 to 84.9 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. The lifetime prevalence of any injury and concussion were 100% and 26%, respectively. The most commonly injured body region was the lower limb, with the knee and thigh being the most frequently injured anatomical locations. The most frequent injury types were muscle injuries and superficial contusions. The most common injury situation was direct contact with another player. There is a substantial risk of injury in ultimate, in particular muscle strains and joint sprains to the knee and shoulder areas. Development and implementation of effective, sport-specific injury prevention initiatives, including improved injury risk management and sport safety culture, should be a priority to reduce the burden of injury in ultimate."

Although the number of ACL injuries in football remains low, it&amp;rsquo;s consequences on both professional and personal lives remain a major concern of rehabilitation. If practitioners often require more time to bring athletes in the best condition, the fact remains that this concept of time before return to sport is nowadays considered as obsolete. Indeed, the better understanding of the mechanisms of lesion and the strains placed on the graft after reconstruction, allow us to establish a personalized program based on clinical criteria and the patient's objectives. The current scientific literature allows us today to optimize the return to play and performance by the use of neuromotor and neurocognitive approaches, muscle strengthening methods and a preventive program necessary to cover the previous level of the players while taking into account physiological and psychological changes due to ACL reconstruction. Indeed, it is important to have a systemic approach centered on the patient, the sports movement, as close as possible to the field in order to find an optimal function of the knee in interaction with its environment.If there is a risk of reinjury of the ACL, it appears important to be able to identify the risk factors so that the player can return to play in optimal conditions."

The SSG training improved the overall RSA performance (ES = -.54, 95%CI = -.89, -.20, p &lt; .05), reduced RSA total time (ES = -.41, 95%CI = -.81, -.01, p &lt; .05), and fatigue index (ES = -.83, 95%CI = -1.65, -.02, p &lt; 0.05). Moderator analysis showed that the fatigue index is impaired when several sessions/week are performed (β = .69, 95%CI = .29, 1.10, R2 = 82.9, p = .001) and is enhanced when the duration of the intervention is extended over several weeks (β = -.25, 95%CI = -.47, -.03, R2 = 56.6, p = .05). The methodological use of SSG enhances the capacity of repeated sprints, while technical and tactical elements are worked concomitantly."
https://openalex.org/W3113192737,Running patterns and force‐velocity sprinting profiles in elite training young soccer players: A cross‐sectional study,2020-12-17,2020,article,"The Volodalen® field method permits to classify runners into aerial or terrestrial, based on vertical oscillation, upper-body motion, pelvis and foot position at ground contact, and foot strike pattern. The present study aimed to compare the sprint running force-velocity profiles between aerial and terrestrial runners. Sixty-Four French National-Level young soccer players (28 females, 36 males) performed three trials of unloaded maximal 40 m sprints. External horizontal power-force-velocity relationships were computed using a validated biomechanical model and based on the velocity-time curve. Accordingly, the participants were classified into patterns in aerial and terrestrial runners. Terrestrial runners showed a higher maximal horizontal force (F0) (6.73 ± 1.03 vs 6.01 ± 0.94 N·kg-1), maximal horizontal power (Pmax) (14.04 ± 3.24 vs 12.51 ± 3.31W·kg-1), maximal acceleration (Acc) (6.83 ± 0.85 vs 6.26 ± 0.89 m·s-2), and maximal rate of horizontal force (RFmax) (57.41 ± 4.64 vs 52.81 ± 5.69%) compared to aerial runners. In contrast, terrestrial runners displayed a more negative rate of decrease of RF (DRF) (-11.65 ± 1.71 vs -10.23 ± 1.66%) and slope of the Force-Velocity relationship (F-V slope) (-0.83 ± 0.11 vs -0.77 ± 0.10 N·s·m-1·kg-1) than aerial runners. The results indicate that terrestrial runners displayed more efficient force production in the forward direction and displayed more ""force-oriented"" F-V profiles. Nevertheless, aerial runners were more effective in maintaining a net horizontal force production with increasing speed. Our results suggest that terrestrial runners could be more adapted to the specific short distance and high acceleration sprints running."

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2020-12-17,2020,review,"The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of natural turf, artificial turf, and sand on sprint performance in different sports and to determine how the sport surface affects sprint performance. A systematic search was conducted in Pubmed, Web of Sciences, and SPORTDiscus databases. Out of 5644 studies, 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The studies were very heterogeneous, as they examined different structural characteristics or quality parameters. The studies on natural turf and sand showed significant improvements on sprint speed during training. On the other hand, the analysis of fatigue did not reveal significant differences in the deterioration of sprint speed on both natural and artificial turf. Significance was set at p < 0.05. In conclusion, although lower performance in sprint was reported on sand, further studies are needed to explain the differences in sprint on natural and artificial turf."
https://openalex.org/W3111724000,What&amp;#39;s New in the Management of Articular Cartilage Injuries in Athletes,2020-12-17,2020,article,"Aim:To review the literature on management of articular cartilage injuries in elite athletes with a focus on new developments.Background: Articular cartilage injury is a common problem that can lead to significant pain and loss of function.This tissue has a poor healing capacity due to its avascular and aneural status.No treatment option has been completely successful in stimulating articular cartilage repair and regeneration.Such an injury in a professional athlete could turn out to be a performance-or a career-ending event.There is a dearth of evidence on the treatment of articular cartilage injuries in athletes.Hence, we reviewed available evidence on the management of articular cartilage injuries in professional athletes. Materials and methods:A key word search was done on PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Ovid Medline.After filtering, 89 articles were reviewed to extract available evidence on the subject.Results: Overall there are few good-quality reports on the outcomes of cartilage repair and reconstruction techniques, specifically in professional athletes.Most reports are case series or reports.Most commonly involved areas include the femoral condyles, femoral heads, talus, humerus condyles, and the humeral head.Various treatment options have been tried and include chondroplasty, microfracture and its various modifications, bilayered autograft and allograft transplantation, and cell-based regenerative techniques (platelet-rich plasma, autologous cultured chondrocytes, and mesenchymal cells).Conclusion: While most treatment methods have produced good results in the short-and mid-term, little good-quality evidence is available on their long-term results.The newer techniques such as tissue engineering methods, 3D bioprinting, and gene therapy appear to be promising.But these are still in preclinical state and are likely to pave way to better treatment options in the future.Clinical significance: Elite athletes are a challenging group of patients who require exacting techniques, more demanding than the general population, to restore their function and return to play at same level.Current available techniques restore their function to a large extent, but outcomes may be improved.Cartilage restoration techniques are evolving, and newer techniques are developing to improve outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3111538122,Multimodal control of neck muscles for vestibular mediated head oscillation damping during walking: a pilot study,2020-12-15,2020,article,"Abstract Purpose It is still in question whether head oscillation damping during walking forms a part of the vestibular function. The anatomical pathway from the vestibular system to the neck muscles via the medial vestibulospinal tract (MVST) is well known but there is a lack of knowledge of the exact influence and modulation of each other in daily life activities. Methods (I) We fixed a head–neck unit of a human cadaver specimen in a steal frame to determine the required pitch-torque for a horizontal head position. The mean value of the acquired pitch-torque was 0.54 Nm. (II) On a motorized treadmill we acquired kinematic data of the head, the sternum and both feet by wireless 3D IMUs for seven asymptomatic volunteers. Subsequently three randomized task conditions were performed. Condition 1 was walking without any irritation. Condition 2 imitated a sacculus irritation using a standardized cVEMP signal. The third condition used an electric neck muscle-irritation (TENS). The data were analyzed by the simulation environment software OpenSim 4.0. Results 8 neck muscle pairs were identified. By performing three different conditions we observed some highly significant deviations of the neck muscle peak torques. Analysing Euler angles, we found during walking a LARP and RALP head pendulum, which also was strongly perturbated. Conclusion Particularly the pitch-down head oscillation damping is the most challenging one for neck muscles, especially under biomechanical concerns. Mainly via MVST motor activity of neck muscles might be modulated by vestibular motor signals. Two simultaneous proprioceptor effects might optimize head oscillation damping. One might be a proprioceptive feedback loop to the vestibular nucleus. Another might trigger the cervicocollic reflex (CCR)."

In our research we were investigating the influence of different ski length on alpine skiing teaching process efficiency as well as on the level of state anxiety during the alpine skiing at ski novices. The research was conducted on 34 participants (19 men, 15 women). Experimental group had skis of 130cm length and 7m radius from brand Lusti. Skis are specialized for very short and aggressive turning including funcarving. Mean height of participants from the experimental group was 178,07cm (±10,89). Control group had skis of standard length according to a person´s height. Meat height of participants from the control group was 177,33cm (±6,87). Mean length of skis were 158,6cm and 14,05m radius. For our research following data were collected: pre-test, continuous test and post – test of state and trait anxiety. In this presented paper the main intention was to determine the effect of different ski length on state anxiety level at novice skiers. The data were acquired from the questionnaire STAI, which shows the level of anxiety (Künzell, S. &amp; Müler, J., 2008; Koca, 2015). Based on the results we can say that teaching alpine skiing with usage of short skis might be less stressful for novice skiers than with usage of standard length skis."

https://openalex.org/W3022097061,An Interdisciplinary Examination of Stress and Injury Occurrence in Athletes,2020-12-14,2020,article,"This paper adopts a novel, interdisciplinary approach to explore the relationship between stress-related psychosocial factors, physiological markers and occurrence of injury in athletes using a repeated measures prospective design. At four data collection time-points, across 1-year of a total 2-year data collection period, athletes completed measures of major life events, the reinforcement sensitivity theory personality questionnaire, muscle stiffness, heart rate variability and postural stability, and reported any injuries they had sustained since the last data collection. Two Bayesian networks were used to examine the relationships between variables and model the changes between data collection points in the study. Findings revealed muscle stiffness to have the strongest relationship with injury occurrence, with high levels of stiffness increasing the probability of sustaining an injury. Negative life events did not increase the probability of injury occurrence at any single time-point; however, when examining changes between time points, increases in negative life events did increase the probability of injury. In addition, the combination of increases in negative life events and muscle stiffness resulted in the greatest probability of sustaining an injury. Findings demonstrated the importance of both an interdisciplinary approach and a repeated measures design to furthering our understanding of the relationship between stress-related markers and injury occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3111002485,Load Distribution Between Right and Left Foot by Using Podata Postural Stabilometric Footplate in Undergraduate Students of Pakistan,2020-12-14,2020,preprint,"Abstract Objective: The objective was to assess the load distribution between right and left foot by using PODATA Postural Stabilometric footplate in undergraduate students of Pakistan. Study design: Cross sectional study. Place and Duration: This study was conducted from the different medical institutes of Pakistan. Methodology: Ethical committee's clearance was acquired from the University of Lahore before this research's ritualistic starting point. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 145 undergraduate students having age years. For data collection, empowerment from patients was started by taking compile agreement from the university's management. Informed consent was taken from the study participants. All questions in the questionnaire were validated through previous literature. Questionnaires were provided and abstracted to the respondents as a pamphlet. After collection, data was saved in a secure place to avoid any biases. Results: Out of 145 students, 115(75.9%) students were females, and 30(24.1%) students were males, 76 students had normal body weight, The mean weight on the right foot was 2.29 ± 0.92 kg by accessor 1, 2.29 ± 0.93 kg by accessor 2 &amp; the mean weight on the left foot was 0.57 ± 0.33 kg by Accessor 1, 0.57 ± 0.34 kg by Accessor 2; hence, there is a significant difference in weight on right &amp; left foot by accessor 1 &amp; accessor 2 during open eyes as the p-value was significant. (value &lt;0.00001**). Conclusion: It was concluded that the load distribution is not the same as the right foot and the left foot. The right foot is dominant; changing the accessor doesn't matter the foot's dominancy, and if someone has right-hand dominance, it's not necessarily that their right foot Will be dominant. Their left foot can also be dominant. Load distribution between foot also depends on the total body weight."
https://openalex.org/W3113021103,Soccer Scoring Techniques — a Scientific Re-conception of Time and Space via Biomechanical Modeling,2020-12-14,2020,preprint,"From a scientific standpoint, both temporal and spatial variables must be examined when developing programs for training various soccer scoring techniques (SSTs), but a review of current literature reveals that existing scientific studies have overlooked this combinatory influence. Consequently, there is no reliable theory on temporal-spatial identification when evaluating scoring opportunities. Quantified by using biomechanical modeling, anthropometry, and SSTs found in FIFA Puskás Award (121 nominated goals between 2009 and 2020), it is found that players’ proprioceptive/effective shooting volume (i.e. players’ attack space) could be sevenfold the currently-practiced shooting volume. The ignorance of some SSTs’ training leads to the underuse of the potential shooting volume. These overlooked SSTs are airborne and/or acrobatic techniques, perceived as high-risk and low-reward. Relying on the talent of an athlete to improvise on the fly can hardly be considered as a viable coaching strategy. Therefore, for developing science-based SST training regimes, groundbreaking studies are needed to: 1) expand the perception of shooting volume, and 2) entrain one-touch-shot techniques (airborne/acrobatic) within this volume, in short, Focusing-on-Time-in-Space. Whence, the new temporal-spatial theory could guide future researches and develop novel training programs. An increase of airborne/acrobatic goals would ultimately further enhance the excitement of the game."

Methods: Twenty seven soccer players (age: 14.5 ± 0.4 years old, body mass: 58.3 ± 9.3 kg, height: 172 ± 8 cm) who participated in the national premier league were recruited. The participants were tested for their balance, activity, and skill in four tests: (I) one leg stance; (II) dynamic Y balance; (III) running; and (IV) dribbling slalom. The acceleration of the body was recorded using an accelerometer during those tests. By processing acceleration data, a new activity-based balance index (ABI) was calculated based on the velocity, acceleration, and position index of soccer players. Using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), reliability was calculated. Results: Reliability was high (ICC = 0.87 - 0.89; 95% CI = 0.77 - 0.93) in calculating ABI for the three activities performed in the tests. A significant positive correlation between ABI and both static and dynamic balance scores (r = 0.62, P = 0.002) was observed. Furthermore, negative correlation was found significantly between ABI and dribbling scores (r = -0.61, P = 0.026) and Y Balance test (r = 0.6, P = 0.002). Conclusions: In conclusion, the introduced ABI demonstrates great potential to determine balance and skill scores based on accelerometer-based measures."

McMeeking’s 70th Birthday,2020-12-12,2020,article,"We are delighted to present to you this special issue of the Journal of Applied Mechanics, in honor of Professor Robert M. McMeeking’s 70th birthday. We thank Yonggang Huang, the journal editor-in-chief for supporting this project. McMeeking served as the journal editor from 2002 to 2012, so it is only fitting that this collection of papers would appear here. We are grateful to the authors who contributed to this special issue and thank the reviewers who made this release possible, despite the many challenges brought on by the pandemic. We thank Norah McMeeking for checking the validity of the details included in the biographical sketch. McMeeking’s four decades as an educator, a caring mentor, and an inspiring role model have earned him profound respect from his former students and colleagues. His research in solid mechanics and materials spans fields as diverse as plasticity theory, fracture mechanics, computational methods, glaciology, hard ceramics, composite materials, ferroelectric systems, microstructural evolution, protection of structures from high-intensity blast waves, fluid-structure interactions arising from underwater blast waves, and biomechanics of cells and lithium-ion batteries and fuel-cells among others. Professor Robert M. McMeekingProfessor Robert M. McMeekingThis special issue is a collection of 19 selected papers dedicated to his honor and to his outstanding contributions to the field, from former students, post-docs, and colleagues scattered around three continents. The papers illustrate research in composite structures, granular media, adhesives, lattice materials, shells, and wave propagation. They also include bioengineering applications. We hope you will enjoy reading them.Robert Maxwell McMeeking was born on May 22, 1950, in Glasgow, Scotland, the middle child of three, with an older brother and a younger sister. His parents owned a thriving ironmongers in the picturesque town of Helensburgh. All the children joined their parents in “the shop” and McMeeking particularly enjoyed helping to count the till each day. Once he learned to drive, he delivered Calor Gas canisters to outlying customers, leading to a livelong pleasure in road trips.McMeeking attended the local primary school and later the esteemed Alan Glen’s School in Glasgow, a selective boys’ high school specializing in science and engineering. He went on to study mechanical engineering at the Glasgow University, where he earned a B.Sc. in 1972 finishing first in his class. During his time at Glasgow, he took mathematics classes with Ian Sneddon and studied mechanics of materials with John Orr, David Brown, Alec MacKenzie, and John Hancock. There, he met Ken Liechti, who remains a long-time friend and colleague.When he approached Sneddon for advice on graduate school, Sneddon recommended he go to Brown University, where a man by the name of James Rice was doing “grand things” in nonlinear fracture mechanics. During his time at Brown, McMeeking found himself in the company of graduate students as excited as him by mechanics. They would often gather and chat about elasticity, plates, or shells using the classic books by Timoshenko, Goodier, or Woinowsky-Krieger.At the time, there was considerable effort in the fracture mechanics community to develop nonlinear methods to model extensive yielding in specimen. In the course, McMeeking interacted with George Irwin, Frank McClintock, Paul Paris, Jim Begley, and John Landes, some of the top researchers in the field. Of James Rice, his Ph.D. advisor, McMeeking says: “He was able to turn my vague understanding of fracture mechanics into a firm grasp of detail and context. He taught me to be effective at research, by his example of connecting applied mechanics to wide ranging, important problems in all sorts of fields.”McMeeking’s 1977 Ph.D. dissertation was on finite deformation plasticity methods for finite elements and ductile crack tip blunting in metals. From 1976 to 1978, he held a position of Acting Assistant Professor at Stanford University, the equivalent of a post-doctoral position, where he worked with Erastus H. Lee on metal forming using large deformation finite element methods. E. H. Lee had been Timoshenko’s student at Stanford in the 1930s.In 1978, McMeeking joined the Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an Assistant Professor. He later described UIUC as “a fantastic place to start a faculty career and a stimulating place to work.” There, he met Fred Leckie, a fellow Scot and a WWII veteran, who was working on high-temperature solid mechanics and became McMeeking’s friend and mentor.In 1985, he joined the Department of Mechanical and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, as a full professor. He was the Department Chair from 1992–1995 and from 1999–2003. In addition to his appointment at UCSB, McMeeking holds various appointments and lectureships around the world: Sixth-Century Professor of Engineering Materials (part-time) at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, Visiting Professor of Materials Engineering at the University of the Saarland, Germany, and External Member of the Leibniz Institute for New Materials, Saarbrücken, Germany.Among his many awards and recognitions, McMeeking became a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1998. In 2002, he was recognized as a Highly Cited Researcher in the fields of Materials Science and Engineering. In 2005, he was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering. He received the Humboldt Research Award for senior scientists in 2006 and again in 2013. In 2007, he was awarded the Brown Engineering Alumni Medal and was elected Fellow of the U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering in 2012.In 2014, McMeeking was recognized with three major awards: the William Prager Medal from the Society of Engineering Science (SES) was presented to him “for contributions underpinning finite deformation computational mechanics and the constitutive characterization of advanced structural and functional materials.” McMeeking became acquainted with Prager during his years as a graduate student at Brown University, where Prager was a professor of applied mathematics. The same year he received the Timoshenko Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, one of the highest honors in applied mechanics. McMeeking was recognized for his “pioneering contributions to broad areas of applied mechanics including nonlinear fracture mechanics, transformation toughening, mechanics of composites, powder consolidation, and ferroelectric fracture and constitutive modeling.” In 2014, he was also elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for “significant contributions in the understanding of how complex materials deform and break and for advancing fundamental engineering knowledge.”McMeeking is currently The Tony Evans Professor of Structural Materials and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at UCSB. McMeeking’s relationship with Evans dates back from the early 1980s and McMeeking credits him for developing his interest in many problems relevant to ceramics and to materials science. The relationship between them grew stronger and upon arriving at UCSB, McMeeking enlisted to participate in a new initiative led by Evans to build an interdisciplinary program at the cross-road between solid mechanics and materials science. The department has grown to being nowadays recognized as one of the best materials programs in the world with renowned researchers, Nobel laureate faculty and state-of-the-art research centers.Bob lives in Santa Barbara with his wife of 44 years, Norah (née Madigan). They have a son, Gavin, and a daughter, Anne, and three grandchildren. Norah says that without the kids at home, Bob doesn’t coach soccer anymore but that during his “spare” time, he likes to show off Scotland to his friends and read Scottish mystery series and Encyclopedia Britannica. He enjoys driving and maps. And wine."

Methods: Twelve semiprofessional soccer players performed 120-min treadmill-based soccer-specific exercise. Surface electromyography (EMG) signals for the rectus femoris (EMGRF) and biceps femoris (EMGBF) were measured as the mean response across a pre-determined 10-second sprint bout during each 15-min block of exercise. Peak eccentric torque of the knee flexors (eccKF) and concentric torque of the knee extensors (conKE) were recorded across angular velocities of 60, 180, and 270 deg∙s-1 immediately pre- and post-exercise. Tri-axial PlayerLoad™ (PL-T) was monitored throughout exercise and defined across vertical (PL-V), anterior-posterior (PL-AP), and medial-lateral (PL-ML) planes of motion. Results: A reduction in normalized EMGRF amplitude was evident at 105‒120 min, versus 0‒15 min (-12.5%; p = .037), 15‒30 min (-12.5%; p = .047), and 45‒60 min (-14%; p = .030). Peak torque of the eccKF was significantly reduced from pre- to post-exercise at 60 (-7.7%; p = .018), 180 (-10.5%; p = .042), and 270 deg∙s-1 (-7.5%; p = .034). A main effect for time was identified for PL-T (p < .010), PL-V (p = .033), and PL-AP (p < .010). Conclusions: These findings suggest that muscle excitation of the rectus femoris is reduced during ET, accompanied with a deficit in the torque generation of the knee flexors following 120 min of soccer-specific activity. Practitioners should adequately condition players for the additional ET period by incorporating exercises into training schedules that develop fatigue-resistant eccentric hamstring strength to minimize injury risk."

Pre-participation, evaluation, biomechanical assessment and new technology are helpful in providing useful information about the cause and mechanism of sports injury and strategies for injury prevention. However, there have been only few previous investigations which can conclusively correlate certain foot types with specific knee injury. Objective: To determine any relationship between foot type and ACL injury. Method: A case-control study design was adopted for this clinical study to investigate foot- type as a risk factor for ACL injury. 35 professional football players with a surgical history of ACL reconstruction and 35 professional football players without any history of ACL injury participated in our study. Foot types were determined by measuring their medial longitudinal arch angle and rearfoot-leg eversion angle. Questionnaire which included other variables of ACL injury were filled and analysed to eliminate their interference in this study. Odds ratio was used as reliable statistical tool to estimate the relative risk. Result: There was a significant relationship between pronated foot type as a risk factor for ACL injury. Conclusion: This suggests that pronated foot is a risk factor for ACL injury in football players."

Seventy-two 11 to 14-year-old soccer players were bio-banded using percentage of estimated adult stature attainment (week 1), maturity-offset (week 2) or a mixed-maturity method (week 3). Players contested five maturity (mis)matched small-sided games with physical and psychological determinants measured. Data were analysed using a series of Bayesian hierarchical models, fitted with different response distributions and different random and fixed effect structures. Few between-maturity differences existed for physical measures. Pre-peak height velocity (PHV) and post-PHV players differed in PlayerLoadTM (anterior-posterior and medial-lateral) having effect sizes above our criterion value. Estimated adult stature attainment explained more of the variance in eight of the physical variables and showed the greatest individual differences between maturity groups across all psychological variables. Pre-PHV and post-PHV players differed in positive attitude, confidence, competitiveness, total psychological score (effect sizes = 0.43-0.69), and session rating of perceived exertion. The maturity-offset method outperformed the estimated adult stature attainment method in all psychological variables. Maturity-matched bio-banding had limited effect on physical variables across all players while enhancing a number of psychological variables considered key for talent identification in pre-PHV players."
https://openalex.org/W3113022834,Stiffness of the Gastrocnemius–Achilles Tendon Complex Between Amateur Basketball Players and the Non-athletic General Population,2020-12-10,2020,article,"Muscle and tendon stiffness are related to sports performance, tendinopathy, and tendon degeneration. However, the effects of habitual loading on muscle and tendon mechanical properties are unclear. Using amateur basketball players as examples, we investigated the effects of mechanical loading on the stiffness of the gastrocnemius–Achilles tendon (AT) complex in non-dominant and dominant lower limbs. Then, we evaluated the correlation between gastrocnemius and AT stiffness. Forty participants (20 amateur basketball players; 20 normal non-athletic persons) were recruited for this study. Stiffness of the gastrocnemius–AT complex was assessed using MyotonPRO at neutral position and 10° dorsiflexion of the ankle joint in participants from amateur basketball players and the non-athletic general population. Our results showed a greater stiffness of the gastrocnemius–AT complex in amateur basketball players than that in healthy non-athletic subjects at neutral position and 10° dorsiflexion of the ankle joint ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant difference in stiffness was found between the non-dominant and dominant lower limbs either in amateur basketball players or in generally healthy subjects ( P &amp;gt; 0.05). A significant positive correlation was obtained between stiffness of the AT and medial gastrocnemius (MG) in amateur basketball players (neutral position: r = 0.726 and P = 0.001; dorsiflexion 10°: r = 0.687 and P = 0.001). The amateur basketball players exhibit significantly higher stiffness value in Achilles and gastrocnemius. This is possibly caused by repeated training effects. The symmetric stiffness of the AT and gastrocnemius exists both in amateur basketball players and generally healthy subjects. A significant correlation between the AT and the MG was found in amateur basketball players."
https://openalex.org/W3112041916,Human Comfortability: Integrating Ergonomics and Muscular-Informed Metrics for Manipulability Analysis During Human-Robot Collaboration,2020-12-09,2020,article,"The ability to compute a quality index for manipulation tasks, in different configurations, has been widely used in robotics. However, it is poorly explored in human manipulation and physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC). Existing works that evaluate efficiency of human manipulation often focus only on heurisitic-based, biomechanics or ergonomics methods/tasks. Complementarity between these performance features allows for a better evaluation and more general criteria, applicable across tasks. This letter addressess this gap by generating a new metric that combines offline pre-computation of biomechanics, ergonomics, muscle assessment and joint constraints, and reducing the online time complexity, enhancing the response query time. The proposed solution allow us to build a quality distribution in the human's workspace which can be quickly tailored to specific tasks and filtered for design purposes. This method simplifies human manipulability assessment for both general and task-specific applications and, in contrast to existing works, is suitable for real-time and/or resource-limited applications. Numerical evidence shows the proposed analysis greatly outperforms previous results in terms of computing time without compromising performance."
https://openalex.org/W3112839398,Effects of Short-term Plyometric Training on Countermovement Vertical Jump Height and Kinematics of Take-Off,2020-12-09,2020,article,"Background: Countermovement vertical jump is a crucial skill in many sports. Plyometric training is a prevalent method to improve athletes' jumping ability. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a 6-week plyometric training on the kinematics of take-off and countermovement vertical jump height. Methods: Fifteen young, healthy male subjects performed plyometric exercises in three sessions per week for six weeks. Digital videos of pre-training and post-training jumps were captured. The Kinovea software was used to measure the kinematic parameters of take-off in the sagittal plane. Pre and post-training values were compared by paired sample t-test with the statistical significance level of P &lt; 0.05. Results: Post-training results showed a higher jump height (P &lt; 0.05), more flexed shoulder, and more extensive hip and knee at take-off (P &lt; 0.05). Also, while hip extension velocity was decreased, shoulder flexion and knee extension velocities were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The 6-week plyometric training, including 720 jumps, improved shoulder flexion, and hip and knee extensions at take-off, resulting in high CMJ height. We employed plyometric training to improve the shoulder flexion and hip and knee extension velocities and increase CMJ height."
https://openalex.org/W3111323379,Kinematics observed during ACL injury are associated with large early peak knee abduction moments during a change of direction task in healthy adolescents,2020-12-06,2020,article,"Abstract Cluster analysis of knee abduction moment waveforms may be useful to examine biomechanical data. The aim of this study was to analyze if the knee abduction moment waveform of early peaks, consistent with anterior cruciate ligament injury mechanisms, was associated with foot‐trunk distance, knee kinematics, and heel strike landing posture, all of which have been observed during anterior cruciate ligament injuries. One hundred and seventy‐seven adolescent athletes performed cutting maneuvers, marker‐based motion capture collected kinetic and marker data and an 8‐segment musculoskeletal model was constructed. Knee abduction moment waveforms were clustered as either a large early peak, or not a large early peak using a two‐step process with Euclidean distances and the Ward‐d2 cluster method. Mediolateral distance between foot and trunk was associated with the large early peak waveform with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.4 (2.7–4.4). Knee flexion angle at initial contact and knee flexion excursion had odds ratios of 1.9 (1.6–2.4) and 1.6 (1.3–2.0). Knee abduction excursions had an odds ratio of 1.8 (1.1–2.4) and 1.8 (1.4–2.4), respectively. Heel strike landings and anteroposterior distance between foot and trunk were not associated with the large early peak waveform with odds ratios of 1.2 (0.9–1.7) and 1.1 (0.8–1.3), respectively. The knee abduction moment waveform is associated with several kinematic variables observed during ACL injury. The results support intervention programs that can modify these kinematics and thus reduce early stance phase knee abduction moments."

The purpose of our study was to inspect those medal-winning European basketball players who competed in the past 19 senior basketball world events. We analysed the tendencies of selection by dissecting the set-up of successful senior national teams. We investigated each one of the 281 European basketball players who won a medal during the analysed period (2000-2019). We collected data from the archive page of FIBA. Our goal was to see whether there was a relation between the youth competition experience and the minutes spent in senior world events. We used the Cramer Association Coefficient, Relative Age Effect and average age were also inspected. We found that participation in the national youth tournaments is important but not the most exclusive factor of selection. There are opportunities for success in the adult national teams for players who have covered alternative sports careers – the factor of national youth experience is not exclusive. We suppose that head coaches utilize older and more experienced players on the Olympic Games, the average ages of successful Olympic medal-winner teams are higher than other world events’ medallists. Despite the fact that we were not able to find statistically proven and associative relationship between national youth recruitment eligibility and the minutes in game spent by successful adult players, further research could be gap fillers in exploring key factors in adulthood efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W3109335029,"A Novel Model for Simulating COVID-19 Dynamics Through Layered Infection States that Integrate Concepts from Epidemiology, Biophysics and Medicine: SEI<sub>3</sub>R<sub>2</sub>S-Nrec",2020-12-03,2020,preprint,"Introduction. Effectively modeling SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 dynamics requires careful integration of population health (public health motivation) and recovery dynamics (medical interventions motivation). This manuscript proposes a minimal pandemic model, which conceptually separates ""complex adaptive systems"" (CAS) associated with social behavior and infrastructure (e.g., tractable input events modulating exposure) from idealized bio-CAS (e.g., the immune system). The proposed model structure extends the classic simple SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, resistant/recovered) uni-causal compartmental model, widely used in epidemiology, into an 8th-order functional network SEI 3 R 2 S-Nrec model structure, with infection partitioned into three severity states (e.g., starts in I1 [mostly asymptomatic], then I2 if notable symptoms, then I3 if ideally hospitalized) that connect via a lattice of fluxes to two ""resistant"" (R) states. Here Nrec (""not recovered"") represents a placeholder for better tying emerging COVID-19 medical research findings with those from epidemiology. Methods. Borrowing from fuzzy logic, a given model represents a ""Universe of Discourse"" (UoD) that is based on assumptions. Nonlinear flux rates are implemented using the classic Hill function, widely used in the biochemical and pharmaceutical fields and intuitive for inclusion within differential equations. There is support for ""encounter"" input events that modulate ongoing E (exposures) fluxes via S↔I1 and other I1/2/3 encounters, partitioned into a ""social/group"" (u SG (t)) behavioral subgroup (e.g., ideally informed by evolving science best-practices), and a smaller u TB (t) subgroup with added ""spreader"" lifestyle and event support. In addition to signal and flux trajectories (e.g., plotted over 300 days), key cumulative output metrics include fluxes such as I3→D deaths, I2→I3 hospital admittances, I1→I2 related to ""cases"" and R1+R2 resistant. The code, currently available as a well-commented Matlab Live Script file, uses a common modeling framework developed for a portfolio of other physiological models that tie to a planned textbook; an interactive web-based version will follow. Results. Default population results are provided for the USA as a whole, three states in which this author has lived (Arizona, Wisconsin, Oregon), and several special hypothetical cases of idealized UoDs (e.g., nursing home; healthy lower-risk mostly on I1→R1 path to evaluate reinfection possibilities). Often known events were included (e.g., pulses for holiday weekends; Trump/governor-inspired summer outbreak in Arizona). Runs were mildly tuned by the author, in two stages: i) mild model-tuning (e.g., for risk demographics such as obesity), then ii) iterative input tuning to obtain similar overall March-thru-November curve shapes and appropriate cumulative numbers (recognizing limitations of data like ""cases""). Predictions are consistent deaths, and CDC estimates of actual cases and immunity (e.g., antibodies). Results could be further refined by groups with more resources (human, data access, computational). It is hoped that its structure and causal predictions might prove helpful to policymakers, medical professionals, and ""on the ground"" managers of science-based interventions. Discussion and Future Directions. These include: i) sensitivity of the model to parameters; ii) possible next steps for this SEI3R2S-Nrec framework such as dynamic sub-models to better address compartment-specific forms of population diversity (e.g., for E [host-parasite biophysics], I's [infection diversity], and/or R's [immune diversity]); iii) model's potential utility as a framework for applying optimal/feedback control engineering to help manage the ongoing pandemic response in the context of competing subcriteria and emerging new tools (e.g., more timely testing, vaccines); and iv) ways in which the Nrec medical submodel could be expanded to provide refined estimates of the types of tissue damage, impairments and dysfunction that are known byproducts of the COVID-19 disease process, including as a function of existing comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3110325785,Applications of drones for safety inspection in the Gulf Cooperation Council construction,2020-12-02,2020,article,"Purpose construction industry in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries is at the peak as the region is in the stage of developing its infrastructures. Apart from some positive sign of this boost, several other issues have also been developed in the region. One of such issues is the safety of workers at the construction sites. This article, based on a variety of applications of drones in other industrial sectors, considers the use of drones for construction safety improvement in the GCC countries. This article aimed to investigate the safety-related applications of drones considering technical features and barriers and enablers for safety-related tasks. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted to achieve the aims and objectives of this research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review, semistructured interviews and using a structured questionnaire. A total of 37 relevant research items and 10 interviews were held with construction safety professionals, and 92 responses collected from the safety managers through a structured questionnaire was used to derive the conclusion of this research. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. Descriptive analyses were carried out in which means and importance factors were calculated. Findings 25.92% of participants confirmed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. The most common application of drones reported by the respondents was photography for marketing purposes followed by surveying application and quality inspections. The camera movability was the top-rated technical feature required for safety-related inspections. Similarly, “Working near the corner or edge of unprotected opening” was the top-rated application of drone for safety-related tasks. The safety concerns of using drones at job sites were rated as the most important barrier by the participants. Technical challenges associated with the use of drones for safety improvement was rated as the second most important barrier by the participants. Research limitations/implications Although, the research presented in this article is based on the GCC construction industry, however, since the data collected through systematic review and semistructured interviews are not a regional base, therefore the finding of this research could also be useful in other regions. Further research however, needs to be conducted to reduce the implications of the barriers identified in this paper so that the drone can be effectively used for safety improvement in construction not only in the GCC region but also in other countries. Practical implications Once the GCC construction industry will be able to overcome the challenges associated with the application of drones in safety improvement, the safety managers will be able to monitor the site more effectively which could be helpful to improve the safety performance of the construction organization. Social implications Improved safety performance in not only in the greater interest of the construction organizations as they can reduce the costs associated with poor safety but can also avoid the delay caused by construction accidents. Similarly, improved safety performance reduces the accidents at construction sites, and thus reduces injuries and disabilities caused by such accidents, making the construction workers a useful part of the society. The application of drones in safety-related tasks is one of the key solutions that can lead us to improved safety performance. Originality/value Although, the use of drone technology has revolutionized a number of industrial sectors due to its variety of applications, the application in construction particularly in the GCC region is still very limited. As noted in the results of this research, only 21 participants (25.92%) expressed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. This means that the industry is not getting the full advantage of the available drone technology. The results of this research will enable construction industry stakeholders to know the challenges associated with the application of drones for safety improvement and to develop strategies to overcome these challenges."

Therefore, eight European pediatric trauma units retrospectively analyzed all patients younger than 18 years suffering lower leg fractures resulting in aseptic nonunion.Thirteen children and adolescents less than 18 years old (2 girls and 11 boys) diagnosed with aseptic nonunion of the tibia and/or fibula were evaluated. In all patients, epidemiological data, mechanism of injury, fracture configuration, and the initial treatment concept were assessed, and the entire medical case documentation was observed. Furthermore, potential causes of nonunion development were evaluated.The mean age of patients was 12.3 years with the youngest patient being seven and the oldest being 17 years old. Open fractures were found in six out of thirteen patients (46%). Nonunion was hypertrophic in ten and oligotrophic in three patients. Mean range of time to nonunion occurrence was 7.3 ± 4.6 months. Nonunion healing resulting in complete metal removal was found in 12 out of 13 patients (92%), only in one case of a misinterpreted CPT type II osseous consolidation could not be found during the observation period. Mean range of time between surgical nonunion revision and osseous healing was 7.3 months as well.If treatment principles of the growing skeleton are followed consistently, aseptic nonunion of the lower leg remains a rare complication in children and adolescents. Factors influencing the risk of fracture nonunion development include patient's age, extended soft tissue damage, relevant bone loss, and inadequate initial treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3111428106,CCL2 is associated with microglia and macrophage recruitment in chronic traumatic encephalopathy,2020-12-01,2020,article,"Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease association with exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) received though playing contact sports such as American football. Past work has implicated early and sustained activation of microglia as a potential driver of tau pathology within the frontal cortex in CTE. However, the RHI induced signals required to recruit microglia to areas of damage and pathology are unknown.Postmortem brain tissue was obtained from 261 individuals across multiple brain banks. Comparisons were made using cases with CTE, cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cases with no neurodegenerative disease and lacked exposure to RHI (controls). Recruitment of Iba1+ cells around the CTE perivascular lesion was compared to non-lesion vessels. TMEM119 staining was used to characterize microglia or macrophage involvement. The potent chemoattractant CCL2 was analyzed using frozen tissue from the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) and the calcarine cortex. Finally, the amounts of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) and Aβ42 were compared to CCL2 levels to examine possible mechanistic pathways.An increase in Iba1+ cells was found around blood vessels with perivascular tau pathology compared to non-affected vessels in individuals with RHI. TMEM119 staining revealed the majority of the Iba1+ cells were microglia. CCL2 protein levels in the DLFC were found to correlate with greater years of playing American football, the density of Iba1+ cells, the density of CD68+ cells, and increased CTE severity. When comparing across multiple brain regions, CCL2 increases were more pronounced in the DLFC than the calcarine cortex in cases with RHI but not in AD. When examining the individual contribution of pathogenic proteins to CCL2 changes, pTau correlated with CCL2, independent of age at death and Aβ42 in AD and CTE. Although levels of Aβ42 were not correlated with CCL2 in cases with CTE, in males in the AD group, Aβ42 trended toward an inverse relationship with CCL2 suggesting possible gender associations.Overall, CCL2 is implicated in the pathways recruiting microglia and the development of pTau pathology after exposure to RHI, and may represent a future therapeutic target in CTE."

Despite extensive literature on the injury and the higher incidence of injury and re-injury in female athletes, there is limited evidence on the return to sport (RTS) of elite female football players following ACL reconstruction (ACLR). RTS is best viewed on a continuum aligning the recovery and rehabilitation process with the ultimate aim — a return to performance (RTP erf ). We outline the RTS and RTP erf of an elite female football player following ACLR and her journey to the FIFA Women’s World Cup, including the gym-based physical preparation and the on-pitch/sports-specific reconditioning. We used the ‘control–chaos continuum’ as a framework for RTS, guiding a return above pre-injury training load demands while considering the qualitative nature of movement in competition. We then implemented the ‘RTP erf pathway’ to facilitate a return to team training, competitive match play and a RTP erf . Objective information, clinical reasoning and shared decision-making contributed to this process and helped the player to reach her goal of representing her country at the FIFA Women’s World Cup."
https://openalex.org/W3106962226,Recommendations for return to sports after total hip arthroplasty are becoming less restrictive as implants improve,2020-12-01,2020,article,"Abstract Introduction Total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgeries are expected to exponentially increase in the upcoming years, likely because of the overall broader indication of THAs. With these developments, an increasing number of younger (&lt; 50 years) and active patients will receive surgical interventions, and expectations for an active lifestyle will accordingly increase. In addition, surgeons now have a growing array of techniques and implant materials to choose from. Despite these developments, evidence to provide the best standard-of-care to patients with high expectations for return to sports (RTS) is scarce and urgently needed. What recommendations do arthroplasty surgeons currently make to patients with high return to sports expectations, what factors may influence their recommendations and what surgical techniques and implant specifications are considered favorable in the treatment of patients with a more active lifestyle? This study was conducted to analyze the current recommendations, patient assessment, and patient counseling after THA to identify trends and relevant factors for surgical decision-making in patients with high-RTS expectations. Material and methods We designed a questionnaire comprising five general items and 19 specific items that included 46 sub-items for hip arthroplasty and conducted a survey among 300 German surgeons specialized in arthroplasty at the German Arthroplasty Society (AE) to assess expert opinions, recommendations, surgical decision-making, and patient counseling for patients with high expectations for RTS after THA. Results The majority of surgeons (81.9%) were in favor of RTS after THA. Risks associated with sports after THA were considered minimal (1%), with periprosthetic fractures ranking highest, followed by hip dislocation and polyethylene wear. Some surgical decision-making was influenced by high-RTS expectations in regard to implant fixation, stem type, femoral head diameter, and bearing-surface tribology. We observed an increasingly liberal counseling of patients for high-impact sports. Conclusion With the improvement of implants and surgical techniques, surgeons are more willing to encourage patients to adopt a more active lifestyle. However, the true long-term limitations need further investigation in future studies. Level of evidence 5 Expert opinions."

Players were classified as Injured (noncontact ACL injury during the season) or Uninjured at the end of the season. Differences between groups for peak hip adduction, internal rotation, and knee abduction angles, and knee valgus collapse were analyzed with a MANOVA.Four non-contact ACL injuries were reported at the end of the season. There was a significant difference between groups for hip adduction angle during the 90 ° cut (p = 0.02) and deceleration (p = 0.03). Players who went on to ACL injury were in more hip adduction.Hip adduction angle is larger in players who go on to ACL injury than those who do not during two sport-specific tasks. The components of knee injury prevention programs that address proximal control and strength are likely crucial for preventing ACL injuries.2b."

Objective To determine if differences were present in the concussion awareness, understanding, and -reporting behaviors of collegiate athletes' in 3 countries with varied degrees of concussion publicity. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Collegiate sports medicine clinics. Patients or Other Participants Collegiate athletes in the United States (n = 964; high publicity), Ireland (n = 302; moderate publicity), and Jordan (n = 129; low publicity). The degree of concussion publicity was categorized based on the extent of national public health awareness initiatives, care guidelines, research publications, and mass media coverage. Main Outcome Measure(s) Participants completed a 10- to 15-minute survey on concussion awareness, understanding, and -reporting behaviors. The main outcome measures were concussion education (awareness; 21 options; select all sources of concussion information), concussion knowledge (understanding; maximum score of 49), and diagnosed/nondisclosed concussion history (reporting behaviors; self-report yes/no items). Results A higher proportion of Jordanian athletes reported never having received concussion information previously (73.6%) than Irish (24.2%) or US athletes (9.4%). Knowledge differed among countries (P &amp;lt; .0001, η2 = .28), with US athletes displaying higher total knowledge scores (40.9 ± 4.5) than Jordanian (35.1 ± 5.6) and Irish (32.1 ± 3.5) athletes. Greater percentages of Irish and US athletes reported a history of a diagnosed concussion (31.8% and 29.6%, respectively) and history of concussion nondisclosure (25.2% and 15.5%, respectively) than Jordanian athletes (2.3% and 0.0% for history of a diagnosed concussion and history of concussion nondisclosure, respectively). Conclusions In the United States, where concussion publicity is high, formal legislation exists, and sports medicine resources and concussion awareness and understanding were increased. More culturally appropriate concussion initiatives are needed globally to ensure that athletes around the world can identify concussive injuries and understand the dangers of continued sport participation while concussed."

The panel consisted of 11 physiotherapists and 8 orthopaedic surgeons. There is limited evidence regarding the use of physiotherapy in the overall management of those with FAIS. Therefore, a group of ISHA member physiotherapists, who treat large numbers of FAIS patients and have extensive experience in this area, constructed a consensus statement to guide physiotherapy-related decisions in the overall management of those with FAIS. The consensus was conducted using a modified Delphi technique. Six major topics were the focus of the consensus statement: (i) hip assessment, (ii) non-surgical physiotherapy management, (iii) pre-habilitation prior to hip arthroscopy, (iv) post-operative physiotherapy rehabilitation, (v) stages of post-operative rehabilitation and (vi) return to sports criteria/guidelines after surgery."

Chiropractors can claim some penetration as health care service providers in high level sport. However, their position as valued members of interprofessional health care teams, especially those built around traditional medical organisational structures, is unclear. This investigation sought to explore the perceived role and value of chiropractors as service providers in elite Danish football clubs. Methods: A comparative qualitative case study was conducted. Six Danish premiere league (Superliga) clubs were purposively sampled to compare and contrast instances where chiropractors were both present and absent from the health care team. Triangulated responses were solicited from healthcare coordinators, chiropractors and athletes within each club’s organization through semi-structured individual interviews. The audio-recorded responses were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using a framework approach. Results: Data were collected September and November 2019. A coding framework of 14 codes and 4 code families emerged, centering around the role of chiropractors, benefits of utilizing chiropractic care and facilitators and barriers to interprofessional practice. From this framework, three themes were abstracted, these being: “Broadening horizons”, “In-house preferred to take-away” and “Already covered, or even necessary?” Conclusion: In this practice context, chiropractors fill the role of musculoskeletal health care service providers. Their perceived value stems from additional expert disciplinary knowledge, improved diagnostic triage and increased treatment flexibility. However, where not utilized, the role of a spinal health expert is questioned and when acknowledged, is limited to that of a technician/therapist. It is unclear from this investigation whether chiropractors can claim core provider status. Further exploration of this interesting context of interprofessional practice is warranted."

Nevertheless, an isolated PLC injury does not only provoke posterolateral instability, but also may be associated to hypermobile lateral meniscus. This study aims at showing the characteristics of isolated PLC injuries and to alert potential overlooked cases by describing their arthroscopic findings and clinical characteristics.Seventy-one patients with a clinically proven isolated PLC injury who underwent knee arthroscopy were included in this study. Pre-operative symptoms and clinical signs at examination were recorded: Pain at the posterolateral aspect, feelings of instability, catching, locking; and for clinical signs: McMurray test, varus stress test in extension and at 30° of flexion, posterolateral drawer test at 30° and 80°, dial test at 30° and 80° of flexion. In terms of arthroscopic findings, systematic meniscal stability was performed to evaluate the presence of hypermobile lateral meniscus, ""lateral drive through test"" was also recorded in all cases.Positive Lateral Drive through test was found in 69 patients (95.8%). Hypermobile lateral meniscus was seen in all patients.Hyper mobile lateral meniscus was concomitant with all isolated PLC injuries in our case series. As the typical arthroscopic characteristic, lateral drive through test positive were seen in 95.8%. In order to prevent overlooking this concomitant pathology, meticulous arthroscopic observation is crucial.Level IV."

Another objective was to verify the physiological and physical responses in the different formats of small-sided games (SSG). Each team in the SSGs was composed of 4 players (4x4). The participants in the research are young football players U-12 (n=8) and U-15 (n=8), affiliated with a club certified as a training entity, and competed in the regional football championship of 7 and 9 players and the national championship of Portugal, respectively. The internal and external load data were collected in 5 formats of SSGs with three field size and in 2 used goalkeepers. We used the WIMU PROTM inertial device for data collection. The registration of the internal charge, using heart rate (HR), was performed with the use by the players of Garmin bands, which send the data to WIMU PROTM devices, through of Ant+ technology. The variance analysis (ANOVA) was used to verify the differences between SSGs and the effect size was determined by calculating partial eta-square). Comparisons between the two age groups were evaluated using standardized differences with combined variance (Cohen’s d). The results show that the manipulation of the playing areas and the use of goalkeepers promoted different effects in the two age groups in terms of distance, explosive distance, accelerations/decelerations and maximum sprint. As for the comparison between SSGs we found differences in the level of external load (distance, accelerations/decelerations and maximum sprint). At the level of internal load, the effects were more evident with field areas above 100m2. We can conclude that the manipulation of the task conditions, playing area and goalkeeper, promote different physical and physiological responses, and the coach should consider this fact, as well as the effects promoted in the age groups."

The purpose of this study was to automatically classify locomotion in an elite sports match where subjects perform rapid changes in movement type, direction, and intensity. Using netball as a test case, six athletes wore a tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope. Feature extraction of player acceleration and rotation rates was conducted on the time and frequency domain over a 1s sliding window. Applying several machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machines (SVM) was found to have the highest classification accuracy (92.0%, Cohen’s kappa Ƙ = 0.88). Highest accuracy was achieved using both accelerometer and gyroscope features mapped to the time and frequency domain. Time and frequency domain data sets achieved identical classification accuracy (91%). Model accuracy was greatest when excluding windows with two or more classes, however detecting the athlete transitioning between locomotion classes was successful (69%). The proposed method demonstrated HAR of locomotion is possible in elite sport, and a far more efficient process than traditional video coding methods."

This study investigated bone parameters in adults with OI type I and their relationship with physical activity and muscle function parameters in comparison with controls. A total of 27 (15 women, 12 men) adults with OI type I and 27 healthy age- and sex-matched controls, with mean age 45 years (range 18–72 years), were included. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography was performed at the lower leg and forearm to assess muscle density, muscle and fat cross-sectional area (CSA) (66% site), and trabecular (4% site) and cortical bone parameters (66% site) at radius and tibia. Physical activity (step count and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) was assessed by accelerometry, muscle function parameters by Leonardo mechanography (single two-legged jump – peak power), and hand grip dynamometry (maximal hand grip strength). Overall, the OI type I group had significantly lower muscle CSA at the lower leg and forearm, lower trabecular and cortical bone mineral content, lower polar stress–strain index (SSIp), and smaller cortices but higher cortical bone mineral density and lower step count and MVPA in comparison with controls. Maximal hand grip strength was positively associated with SSIp at radius (p = 0.012) in the control group but not in the OI type I group (p = 0.338) (difference in associations: p = 0.012). No other significantly different associations between bone and muscle function parameters or physical activity (step count or MVPA) were found in the OI type I versus control group. We conclude that adults with OI type I have smaller bones, lower trabecular bone mass, lower estimates of bone strength, and higher cortical density in comparison with controls and that there are some indications of a disturbed biomechanical muscle–bone relationship in adults with OI type I. © 2022 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR)."

Following a hamstring injury, deficits in peak and explosive strength may persist after return to sport potentially affecting sprint performance. Assessment of repeated-sprint ability is recognized as an important part of the return to sport evaluation after a hamstring injury.Purpose: This purpose of this exploratory cross-sectional study was to compare sprinting performance obtained during a repeated-sprint test between football players with and without a previous hamstring strain injury. Methods: Forty-four fully active sub-elite football players, 11 with a previous hamstring strain injury during the preceding 12 months (cases; mean age, SD: 25.6 ± 4.4) and 33 demographically similar controls (mean age, SD: 23.2 ± 3.7), were included from six clubs. All players underwent a repeated-sprint test, consisting of six 30-meter maximal sprints with 90 seconds of recovery between sprints. Sprint performance was captured using high-speed video-recording and subsequently assessed by a blinded tester to calculate maximal sprint velocity, maximal horizontal force, maximal horizontal power, and mechanical effectiveness. Results: A significant between-group difference was seen in favor of players having a previous hamstring injury over 6 sprints for maximal velocity (mean difference: 0.457 m/s, 95% CI: 0.059-0.849, p = 0.025) and mechanical effectiveness (mean difference: 0.009, 95% CI: 0.001-0.016, p = 0.020). Conclusion: Repeated-sprint performance was not impaired in football players with a previous hamstring strain injury; in fact, higher mean maximal sprinting velocity and better mechanical effectiveness were found in players with compared to without a previous hamstring injury. The higher sprinting velocity, which likely increases biomechanical load on the hamstring muscles, in previously injured players may increase the risk of recurrent injuries. Level of evidence: 3b."

Methods Hamstring strength and passive stiffness were measured in professional male soccer players before and after the pre-season (4 weeks), and after the in-season (6 weeks) periods using an isokinetic dynamometer. Muscle passive stiffness was determined from the slope of the passive torque-angle relationship. External loads (acceleration and jumps) were monitored by GPS and internal loads by questionnaire. Results Hamstring passive stiffness increased after 10 weeks of training and matches, without changes in passive peak torque and range of motion. The hamstring passive stiffness modifications were associated with the volume and intensity of accelerations and jumps. The individual data analysis also provided some support for the suppression of the biomechanical adaptation in the subjects with relatively large external load. Conclusions Regular training and match workouts increase hamstring passive stiffness in professional soccer players but the adaptation of muscle-tendon unit passive elements might not occur if players experience excessive mechanical stress."

https://openalex.org/W3123026355,Biogeomorphology of salt marshes,2020-12-01,2020,dissertation,"The coastal zone is the most densely populated area globally and economic activity is high. 70% of the world’s megacities is located in this area, and the population is still growing. However, coastal protection is a prerequisite to work and live in this area, especially with predicted sea level rise and extreme storms becoming more frequent and severe. Salt marshes can contribute to coastal protection by having the ability to adapt to a changing environment, whereas conventional infrastructure like dikes and seawalls remain fixed over time. So by combining conventional coastal infrastructure and ecosystems in nature based flood defenses, coastal protection becomes more sustainable. The contribution of salt marshes to coastal protection by attenuating waves, depends on the size of the salt marsh and thereby the location of the salt marsh edge. The key question of this thesis is: What is the long-term (50 year) variability of the location of the salt marsh edge and what is the corresponding variability of the wave attenuating capacity of salt marshes?The location of the marsh edge is restricted by two interacting factors: inundation time and bed level change. For vegetation establishment to withstand longer inundation stress, more stable bed levels are required so that plants are not disturbed. Vice versa, to withstand more dynamic bed levels that disturb plant growth, lower inundation stress is required, so that plants grow fast enough to recover from the stress. Moreover, the seaward growth and landward retreat of the marsh edge is driven by the magnitude of daily mild wave conditions and sediment availability. Periods of small waves and/or large sediment availability enable the marsh to grow seaward and vice versa. Short-term high waves affect establishing juvenile salt marshes, resulting in a retreating marsh edge. All processes resulting in retreat and expansion of the salt marsh edge, affect the wave attenuating capacity. Generally, the larger the cross-shore width of the salt marsh, the larger the wave attenuating capacity. Nevertheless, both artificial marshes and existing salt marshes contribute to the wave attenuation under a range of hydrodynamic conditions."

The Kinetic Control (KC) concept uses the movement control rating system, based on motor tests and exercises aimed at re-educating motor control. The present study explored the effects of motor control training on the KC concept in treating patella ligament tendinopathy in a female football player. Methods: The current case study was conducted on a 20-year-old female football player. She had been complaining of pain in the front of the right knee joint for two months. Her treatment involved KC training was conducted for 6 weeks (3 times a week for 30 minutes). To investigate the effectiveness of the presented therapy, the following tools were used: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment–Patella (VISA-P scale), the Modified Laitinen Pain Questionnaire, Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) test on a dynamometric platform, and quadriceps muscle isometric test. The Asymmetry Index (AI) was applied to assess the asymmetry of quadriceps strength and lower limb loading. Results: The degree of pain (i.e. measured by the VAS) decreased from 7 points at pre-training to 1 point after 6 weeks of therapy. In the VISA-P measurement, pain decreased as a result of an increase in points from 53 to 82. Pain complaints (i.e. measured using the Laitinen questionnaire) decreased from 7 to 2 points. After treatment, the AI improved in all phases of the tests. Discussion: The achieved data indicated that the neuromuscular KC training was effective in treating patellar tendinopathy. However, it is necessary to conduct further studies with larger sample size."

Clarke (2005), Gomez and Pollard (2011) and Bray and Widmeyer (2008) explored the home court advantage topic and argued that this exists and is influenced by various factors (such as familiarity with environment, crowd support and loud arena, shooting percentages, absence of travel, etc.). A top division professional basketball team from Lithuania (Žalgiris Kaunas) was selected for this study using a convenience sample method (Veal and Darcy 2014). A case study approach (which incorporated comparisons between and an analysis of certain statistical categories such as: points scored per game; points allowed per game; free throws – made and attempted per game; 3 points shots – made and attempted; assists and turnovers) were used as part of this investigation into Žalgiris Kaunas basketball team and the games they played at home during 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons. From a methodological point of view, a three stage approach was employed. First stage was an exploratory analysis of relevant data available in the public domain for the selected team /club. Second stage comprised of an initial analysis that consisted of statistical calculations (averages per game and per season) and comparisons between Žalgiris Kaunas and their opponents while a discussion and concluding analysis – as a third stage – was drawn by interpretation of data. Similar to findings from literature, playing at home in front of full capacity crowd was beneficial for Žalgiris Kaunas as their performances improved for the statistical categories previously mentioned, alongside with being victorious in 11 out of the 19 home games that were scrutinised for the purpose of the research.

The aim of this research is to examine the level of knowledge of ultrasonographers regarding preventative measures and health consequences of the forced body positions during work. The total of 75 doctors of both genders, aged 31-50 years, who use ultrasound diagnostics participated in the research. The research was conducted throughout 2016, as a crosssectional study, with the aid of a structured questionaire. The total of 60% subjects either rarely use the break during working hours or do not have a break at all. The participants most commonly use the movable monitor and the ability to wrap the cable around their arm (73,3%). This percentage is similar in all age groups. The respondents most often stated that they walk daily (41,3%), with no differences among age groups. 25% of the respondents negate any spine related pains, while over a half said that they experience pain in one segment of the spinal column (cervical, thoracic or lumbar), regardless of the age group. 52% said that they serch for information on their own accord, while 36% stated that they are not at all informed. Only in less than 10% of cases is information provided by the authorities in the institution where the participants are employed, and during regular health examinations, information is given by the designated doctor in 2,7% of cases.The respondents implement the recommendations regarding safe work and other preventative measures to a very small extent, regardless of gender and age. Most of the respondents experience pain in the spine and joints, which can be related to the work in ultrasound diagnostics. Additionally, doctors are not well-informed regarding the preventative measures."

The tool is particularly devised to support clinicians and sport professionals in their daily routines, as an assessment tool in the prevention, monitoring rehabilitation and training field. This study aimed at determining the validity of the mDurance system for measuring muscle activity by comparing sEMG output with a reference sEMG system, the Delsys® system. Fifteen participants were tested during isokinetic knee extensions at three different speeds (60, 180, and 300 deg/s), for two muscles (rectus femoris [RF] and vastus lateralis [VL]) and two different electrodes locations (proximal and distal placement). The maximum voluntary isometric contraction was carried out for the normalization of the signal, followed by dynamic isokinetic knee extensions for each speed. The sEMG output for both systems was obtained from the raw sEMG signal following mDurance's processing and filtering. Mean, median, first quartile, third quartile and 90th percentile was calculated from the sEMG amplitude signals for each system. The results show an almost perfect ICC relationship for the VL (ICC &amp;gt; 0.81) and substantial to almost perfect for the RF (ICC &amp;gt; 0.762) for all variables and speeds. The Bland-Altman plots revealed heteroscedasticity of error for mean, quartile 3 and 90th percentile (60 and 300 deg/s) for RF and at mean and 90th percentile for VL (300 deg/s). In conclusion, the results indicate that the mDurance® sEMG system is a valid tool to measure muscle activity during dynamic contractions over a range of speeds. This innovative system provides more time for clinicians (e.g., interpretation patients' pathologies) and sport trainers (e.g., advising athletes), thanks to automatic processing and filtering of the raw sEMG signal and generation of muscle activity reports in real-time."
https://openalex.org/W3109175767,Combinations of trabecular and cortical bone properties distinguish various loading modalities between athletes and controls,2020-11-27,2020,article,"Abstract Objectives Variation in trabecular and cortical bone properties is often used to infer habitual behavior in the past. However, the structures of both types of bone are rarely considered together and may even contradict each other in functional interpretations. We examine trabecular and cortical bone properties in various athletes and sedentary controls to clarify the associations between combinations of cortical and trabecular bone properties and various loading modalities. Materials and methods We compare trabecular and cortical bone properties using peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of the tibia between groups of 83 male athletes (running, hockey, swimming, cricket) and sedentary controls using Bayesian multilevel models. We quantify midshaft cortical bone rigidity and area (J, CA), midshaft shape index (Imax/Imin), and mean trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in the distal tibia. Results All groups show unique combinations of biomechanical properties. Cortical bone rigidity is high in sports that involve impact loading (cricket, running, hockey) and low in nonimpact loaded swimmers and controls. Runners have more anteroposteriorly elliptical midshafts compared to other groups. Interestingly, all athletes have greater trabecular BMD compared to controls, but do not differ credibly among each other. Discussion Results suggest that cortical midshaft hypertrophy is associated with impact loading while trabecular BMD is positively associated with both impact and nonimpact loading. Midshaft shape is associated with directionality of loading. Individuals from the different categories overlap substantially, but group means differ credibly, suggesting that nuanced group‐level inferences of habitual behavior are possible when combinations of trabecular and cortical bone are analyzed."

Despite progress, the infrastructure and general sport science provisions in many female sports are behind their male counterparts. From a performance perspective, marked differences in physical and physiological characteristics can be seen between the sexes. Although physical preparation practices for male athletes are known, there are currently no published literature pertaining exclusively to female athletes. This information would provide invaluable data for both the researcher and practitioner alike. This survey therefore aimed to examine current practices utilized in female rugby codes (union, league, and sevens). A questionnaire assessing seasonal physical preparation practices, recovery, monitoring and sport science technology, and unique aspects in female rugby was developed. Thirty-seven physical preparation practitioners (32 males, 5 females) responded to the questionnaire. Most participants (78%) worked with national or regional/state level female athletes. Performance testing was more frequently assessed in the pre- (97%) and in-season (86%), than off-season (23%). Resistance, cardiovascular, sprint and plyometric training, and recovery sessions were all believed to be important to enhancing performance and implemented by most participants (≥ 89%). Sport science technologies were commonly (54%) utilized to inform current practice. Menstrual cycle phase was monitored by 22% of practitioners. The most frequently reported unique considerations in female rugby codes included psycho-social aspects (41%), the menstrual cycle (22%), and physical differences (22%).

Imaging was acquired using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), providing total body measures of fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content (BMC). Year to year, testing groups showed a homogenous grouping of anthropometric, body composition, and bone density metrics. Composite averages were calculated to provide an anthropometric profile of the elite strongman competitor ( N = 18; mean ± SD ): age, 33.0 ± 5.2 years; body height, 187.4 ± 7.1 cm; body mass, 152.9 ± 19.3 kg; body mass index, 43.5 ± 4.8 kg·m −2 ; fat mass, 30.9 ± 11.1 kg; lean mass, 118.0 ± 11.7 kg, body fat, 18.7 ± 6.2%, total BMC, 5.23 ± 0.41 kg, and bone mineral density, 1.78 ± 0.14 g·cm −2 . These data demonstrate that elite strongman competitors are among the largest human male athletes, and in some cases, they are at the extreme limits reported for body size and structure. Elite strongman competitors undergo a high degree of mechanical stress, providing further insight into the potent role of physical training in mediating structural remodeling even into adulthood. Such data provide a glimpse into a unique group of competitive athletes pushing the limits not only of human performance but also of human physiology."

Such an imbalance could lead to a greater risk of injury; however, despite this potential risk, little is known about the effects of bilateral differences on dancers' postural stability during jump landings, a key dynamic action in dance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of possible bilateral differences on dynamic postural stability during single-leg landing using a time-to-stabilization protocol. Thirty-two injury-free female university undergraduate dancers (19 ± 1.9 years; 164.8 ± 6.7 cm; 62.6 ± 13.6 kg) volunteered for the study. They completed a two-foot to one-foot jump over a bar onto a force platform while stabilizing as quickly as possible. The landing leg was randomly assigned, and participants completed three trials for each leg. No significant differences in dynamic postural stability between right and left legs were revealed, and poor effect size was noted (p &gt; 0.05): MLSI: t = -.04, df = 190, p = 0.940 (CI = -.04, .04, r 2 = 0); APSI: t = .65, df = 190, p = 0.519 (CI = -.06-, .12, r 2 = .09); VSI: t = 1.85, df = 190, p = 0.066 (CI = -.02, .68, r 2 = .27); DPSI: t = 1.88, df = 190, p = 0.061 (CI = -.02, .70, r 2 = .27). The results of this study do not support the notion that dance training may cause lateral bias with its associated risk of injury. Furthermore, dancers' self-perceptions of leg dominance did not correlate with their ability to balance in single-leg landings or to absorb the ground reaction forces often associated with injury. Even when biased training exists, it may not have detrimental effects on the dancer's postural stability."

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-11-20,2020,review,"Good balance is a pre-requisite for various activities of daily life and sports. Physiotherapists thus regularly assess and train patient's balance capacities. In order to interpret the test results of unilateral balance tests, a comparison with normative data is common. In patients who had an injury or a surgery, the performance of the injured leg is often compared with performance of the non-injured leg. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if unilateral balance performance differs between the dominant and non- dominant legs. If so, this should take into consideration when interpreting test results.This meta-analysis summarized the current evidence to determine if the balance performance of healthy adults was influenced by the leg's dominance.Articles were searched in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane and Embase. Data from studies meeting the pre-defined inclusion criteria were extracted in a standardized form. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model.Forty-six studies were included. Their data were allocated in 7 categories of balance tests. Significant differences between the dominant and the non-dominant legs were not found in any of the categories (surface stable, eyes open: -0.04, 95 % CI -0.12 to 0.05, surface stable eyes closed: -0.06, 95 % CI -0.22 to 0.11, surface unstable, eyes open: -0.15, 95 % CI -0.38 to 0.07, surface unstable, eyes closed: -0.06, 95 % CI -0.27 to 0.15, BESS (Balance Error Scoring System): 0.03, 95 % CI -1.09 to 1.14, SEBT (Star Excursion Balance Test)/YBT (Y Balance Test): 0.06, 95 % CI -0.04 to 0.16, jump: 0.04, 95 % CI -0.28 to 0.36).Results indicate that balance performance is not influenced by the leg's dominance. This means that performances of both legs can be used as reference. Evidence is strong for the one leg stance. However, future studies are needed to confirm our results for stabilization tasks after a jump landing."

(2) Methods: To evaluate the stress distribution in the bone and teeth in this situation, models of maxillary central incisor were created containing cortical bone, trabecular bone, soft tissue, root dentin, enamel, periodontal ligament, and antagonist teeth were modeled. One model received a MG with 4-mm thickness. Both models were subdivided into finite elements. The frictionless contacts were used and a nonlinear dynamic impact analysis was performed in which a rigid object hit the model at 1 m·s-1. For each model, an ankylosed periodontal ligament was simulated totaling 4 different situations. The results were presented in von-Mises stress maps. (3) Results: A higher stress concentration in teeth and bone was observed for the model without a MG and with ankylosed tooth (19.5 and 37.3 MPa, respectively); the most promising mechanical response was calculated for patients with healthy periodontal ligament and MG in position (1.8 and 7.8 MPa, respectively). (4) Conclusions: The MG's use is beneficial for healthy and ankylosed teeth, since it acts by dampening the generated stresses in bone, dentin, enamel and periodontal ligament. However, patients with ankylosed tooth are more prone to root fracture even when the MG is in position compared to a healthy tooth."

One of the modifying factors is the ""Relative Age Effect-RAE"". However, its impact depends on the sample characteristics and sport context. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the RAE on basketball competition performance by analysing peer-reviewed articles published until July 2020. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic search guidelines, nine studies were identified in four databases: Sport Discus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Moreover, a study quality analysis using ""Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology"" guidelines was carried out. The results confirmed an impact of the RAE on competition performance in basketball (56% measurements) and a higher influence of the RAE on short-term collective performance (54% measurements). Statistical parameters were affected, especially in men and U14-U18 categories. No impact of the RAE reversal and no influence of the RAE on long-term collective performance were found. There was a higher impact of the RAE in men (71%), the U14-U18 categories (44%), and at the national level (40%) was identified. The RAE has a variable influence on basketball performance according to developmental constraints. Nevertheless, the findings should be considered based on the sport context due to the heterogeneity and variability of the identified results."
https://openalex.org/W3105916141,Motor learning in real-world pool billiards,2020-11-18,2020,article,"Abstract The neurobehavioral mechanisms of human motor-control and learning evolved in free behaving, real-life settings, yet this is studied mostly in reductionistic lab-based experiments. Here we take a step towards a more real-world motor neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and the sports of pool billiards to frame a real-world skill learning experiment. First, we asked if well-known features of motor learning in lab-based experiments generalize to a real-world task. We found similarities in many features such as multiple learning rates, and the relationship between task-related variability and motor learning. Our data-driven approach reveals the structure and complexity of movement, variability, and motor learning, enabling an in-depth understanding of the structure of motor learning in three ways: First, while expecting most of the movement learning is done by the cue-wielding arm, we find that motor learning affects the whole body, changing motor-control from head to toe. Second, during learning, all subjects decreased their movement variability and their variability in the outcome. Subjects who were initially more variable were also more variable after learning. Lastly, when screening the link across subjects between initial variability in individual joints and learning, we found that only the initial variability in the right forearm supination shows a significant correlation to the subjects’ learning rates. This is in-line with the relationship between learning and variability: while learning leads to an overall reduction in movement variability, only initial variability in specific task-relevant dimensions can facilitate faster learning."

This high-level processing has been associated with structural and functional adaptation of the brain for high performance sensorimotor integration. For these integration processes, adaptation does not only take place in primary and secondary sensory and motor areas but also in tertiary brain areas, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), providing vital resources for highly specialized performance. Here, we review evidence for the role of these brain areas in multimodal training protocols and integrate these findings into a new model of sensorimotor processing in complex motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W3102844221,Characterization of the Biomechanical and Situational Aspects of High Magnitude Subconcussive Impacts in Collegiate Football,2020-11-17,2020,article,"<h3>Objective</h3> The objective of this study was to characterize high magnitude subconcussive impacts in football to identify injurious relationships between player/game-based characteristics and impact magnitude and frequency. <h3>Background</h3> Subconcussive impacts are asymptomatic head impacts thought to induce alterations in the brain after repetitive exposure. Understanding factors that lead to higher magnitude or frequency of head impacts in football is crucial to develop harm reduction and prevention strategies. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Eighty-one male university level football players were equipped with helmet accelerometers to capture linear acceleration (LA), impact frequency and helmet impact location. Impacts with LA = 60 g were included in the analysis. Video footage from 15 games over three seasons was analyzed to characterize aspects of play including play type, position, closing distance, player technique, tackling versus blocking and impact type (helmet-to-helmet/body/ground). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 570 impacts were included in the analysis with a mean LA of 83.44 g ± 23.60. Impacts with a closing distance of = 10 yards resulted in higher LA compared to &lt;10 yards and occurred most frequently in run plays. Wide receivers and defensive backs were most often involved in impacts with a larger closing distance and experienced the highest average LA behind quarterbacks. Helmet-to-body impacts generated significantly higher LA compared to helmet-to-helmet, though helmet-to-helmet occurred more often. Players involved in a tackle sustained significantly higher LAs than those involved in a block. Impacts in which players exhibited poor technique lead to higher LA and occurred more frequently in tackling versus blocking impacts. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The results of this work suggest that rules regarding offensive backfield running starts could be adjusted to decrease risk of impact after a larger closing distance. Behavioral modifications and coaching approaches aimed at improving tackling technique could decrease exposure to threshold impacts at the level of the individual player."

https://openalex.org/W3101447882,Value of isokinetic strength testing for hamstring injury risk assessment: Should the ‘strongest’ mates stay ashore?,2020-11-16,2020,article,"Although isokinetic strength testing is commonly used in hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation and prevention, research findings concerning its predictive value remain inconclusive. Existing research focuses on peak torque (PT) and angle of PT, not analysing the torque behaviour throughout the testing range of motion (ROM). This study intended to assess the value of isokinetic curve evaluation in association with HSI. A sample of 116 male football players with and without a recent HSI history was submitted to bilateral isokinetic assessment of the knee and hip muscles. Raw isokinetic data were filtered and normalized prior to curve analysis submission in MATLAB. Torque development of each muscle group throughout the entire testing ROM was assessed using HSI history as an independent variable. Curve analysis revealed significant differences in torque behaviour in function of injury history. Players with an HSI history demonstrated significantly stronger concentric knee flexion and extension, eccentric knee extension and concentric hip extension patterns compared to the controls and their uninjured limb. HSI history was also associated with lower concentric hip flexion torques and lower mixed H:Q ratios compared to the control group and their contralateral limb. HSI history was associated with altered knee and hip muscle strength profiles, potentially due to isolated focus on local strength training in rehabilitation or mechanisms of neuromuscular inhibition. Because the differences in torque amplitude were range-dependent and did not systematically concur with the point of PT achievement, isokinetic strength evaluation should most probably be conducted using curve analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3102259111,The moderating impact of maturation on acute neuromuscular and psycho‐physiological responses to simulated soccer activity in academy soccer players,2020-11-16,2020,article,"AbstractResource constraints complicate load monitoring practices in some academies, which is problematic based on load-injury associations surrounding periods of rapid non-linear growth. Limited research has explored relationships between maturation and perceived psycho-physiological response to activity and associated neuromuscular performance changes. This study aimed to quantify neuromuscular and psycho-physiological responses to standardised activity and analyse whether dose-responses were moderated by maturation. Fifty-seven male soccer players (age: 14.1 ± 0.9 years; stature: 165 ± 10 cm; body mass, 57 ± 9 kg; percentage of predicted adult height 92.7 ± 5%) from two Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) academies completed the youth soccer-specific aerobic fitness test (Y-SAFT60). Countermovement jump (CMJ), reactive strength index (RSI), absolute (ABS) and relative leg stiffness (REL) were measured pre-post the Y-SAFT60 with playerload (PL), heart rate (HR), total distance (TDist) and differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) used as markers of load and intensity. A moderation model was employed to analyse interactions of maturation as a continuous variable. Analysis indicated no significant interaction (p <0.05) between maturation and neuromuscular performance but RPE-Technical demonstrated significant interactions (p = 0.01). Slope analysis indicated four variables (PL, RSI, ABS and REL) that demonstrated significance at various stages of maturation, most notably aligning with peak height velocity (∼87-96% PAH). Tentatively, we propose that maturational developments in the neuromuscular system offer some mechanistic explanation to the varied dose-responses observed. It is therefore important that maturation is habitually considered within prescription of training programmes and that further empirical studies are completed to determine maturity specific dose-responses."

T2-weighed fat-saturated MRI is reportedly useful for the detection of BME in the pedicle in the early stage of spondylolysis; however, to our knowledge, the quantitative assessment of BME in spondylolysis has not been reported.Adolescent athletes with spondylolysis, including those with symptoms of low back pain, were enrolled. The sporting activity of the patients was restricted, and a hard brace was attached to the spine. The BME range of interest was taken on T2-weighed fat-saturated MRI, and the signal intensity (SI) of the BME (SIedema) was measured. The contrast ratio (CR) between the SI of the BME and SI of the spinal cord (SIcord) was calculated per the following formulae: CRedema=(SIedema-SIcord)/(SIedema+SIcord). The CR of the normal pedicle was measured as a control per the following formulae: CRcontrol=(SIcontrol-SIcord)/(SIcontrol+SIcord).The study enrolled 32 men and one woman; the mean patient age was 15.2 years (range, 12-18 years). The average CR of the edema and normal pedicle at the first visit was 0.506 (range, 0.097-0.804) and 0.137 (range, -0.741 to 0.572), respectively. The CR of the edema was significantly higher as compared to that of the normal pedicle (p<0.01). MRI that was performed 1 month after the first visit showed that the CR of the edema had decreased to 0.204 (range, -0.152 to 0.517). The CR of the edema 1 month thereafter was significantly lower than that at the first visit (p<0.01).Quantitative assessment of BME using CR on MRI is useful in the evaluation of the healing process of spondylolysis."

However, it faces several limitations, mainly due to hardware constraints and limitations engendered by the stimulation needed by the BCI. The main restriction is still the low transfer rate that can be achieved by current BCI technology, preventing movement while using VR. The goal of this paper is to review current limitations and to provide application creators with design recommendations to overcome them, thus significantly reducing the development time and making the domain of BCI more accessible to developers. We review the design of video games from the perspective of BCI and VR with the objective of enhancing the user experience. An essential recommendation is to use the BCI only for non-complex and non-critical tasks in the game. Also, the BCI should be used to control actions that are naturally integrated into the virtual world. Finally, adventure and simulation games, especially if cooperative (multi-user), appear to be the best candidates for designing an effective VR game enriched by BCI technology."

This study investigated the in-game cutting maneuvers performed by female ultimate frisbee athletes to understand the movements that could put them at risk of ACL injury. (2) Lower-body kinematics and movement around the field were reconstructed from wearable lower-body inertial sensors worn by 12 female players during 16 league-sanctioned ultimate frisbee games. (3) 422 cuts were identified from speed and direction change criteria. The mean cut had approach speed of 3.4 m/s, approach acceleration of 3.1 m/s2, cut angle of 94 degrees, and ground-contact knee flexion of 34 degrees. Shallow cuts from 30 to 90 degrees were most common. Speed and acceleration did not change based on cut angle. Players on more competitive teams had higher speed and acceleration and reduced knee flexion during cutting. (4) This study demonstrates that a lower-body set of wearable inertial sensors can successfully track an athlete’s motion during real games, producing detailed biomechanical metrics of behavior and performance. These in-game measurements can be used to specify controlled cutting movements in future laboratory studies. These studies should prioritize higher-level players since they may exhibit higher-risk cutting behavior."

Inertial sensors can provide valuable biofeedback in combat sports such as boxing; however, the use of such technology has not had a global uptake. If simple inertial sensor configurations can be used to automatically classify strike type, then cumbersome tasks such as video labelling can be bypassed and the foundation for automated workload monitoring of combat sport athletes is set. This investigation evaluates the classification performance of six different supervised machine learning models (tuned and untuned) when using two simple inertial sensor configurations (configuration 1—inertial sensor worn on both wrists; configuration 2—inertial sensor worn on both wrists and third thoracic vertebrae [T3]). When trained on one athlete, strike prediction accuracy was good using both configurations (sensor configuration 1 mean overall accuracy: 0.90 ± 0.12; sensor configuration 2 mean overall accuracy: 0.87 ± 0.09). There was no significant statistical difference in prediction accuracy between both configurations and tuned and untuned models (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant statistical difference in computational training time for tuned and untuned models (p &gt; 0.05). For sensor configuration 1, a support vector machine (SVM) model with a Gaussian rbf kernel performed the best (accuracy = 0.96), for sensor configuration 2, a multi-layered perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) model performed the best (accuracy = 0.98). Wearable inertial sensors can be used to accurately classify strike-type in boxing pad work, this means that cumbersome tasks such as video and notational analysis can be bypassed. Additionally, automated workload and performance monitoring of athletes throughout training camp is possible. Future investigations will evaluate the performance of this algorithm on a greater sample size and test the influence of impact window-size on prediction accuracy. Additionally, supervised machine learning models should be trained on data collected during sparring to see if high accuracy holds in a competition setting. This can help move closer towards automatic scoring in boxing."

CHANGE–OF–DIRECTION sprint training,2020-11-13,2020,article,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of two different sprint-training regimes on sprint and jump performances according to age in elite young male soccer players over the course of one soccer season.Players were randomly assigned to two training groups. Group 1 performed systematic change-of-direction sprints (CODST, U19 [n = 9], U17 [n = 9], U15 [n = 10]) while group 2 conducted systematic linear sprints (LST, U19 [n = 9], U17 [n = 9], U15 [n = 9]). Training volumes were similar between groups (40 sprints per week x 30 weeks = 1200 sprints per season). Pre and post training, all players performed tests for the assessment of linear and slalom sprint speed (5-m and 10-m), countermovement jump, and maximal aerobic speed performance.For all physical fitness measures, the baseline-adjusted means data (ANCOVA) across the age groups showed no significant differences between LST and CODST at post (0.061 < p < 0.995; 0.0017 < d < 1.01). The analyses of baseline-adjusted means for all physical fitness measures for U15, U17, and U19 (LST vs. CODST) revealed no significant differences between LST and CODST for U15 (0.213 < p < 0.917; 0.001 < d < 0.087), U17 (0.132 < p < 0.976; 0.001 < d < 0.310), and U19 (0.300 < p < 0.999; 0.001 < d < 0.049) at post.The results from this study showed that both, LST and CODST induced significant changes in the sprint, lower limbs power, and aerobic performances in young elite soccer players. Since no significant differences were observed between LST and CODST, the observed changes are most likely due to training and/or maturation. Therefore, more research is needed to elucidate whether CODST, LST or a combination of both is beneficial for youth soccer athletes' performance development."

Although epidemiologic investigations have provided insight into patient and injury characteristics associated with running injuries, little is known about how these injuries are managed at the point of care. Objective To describe injury and treatment characteristics of injuries sustained during cross-country. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting High school athletic training clinics within the Athletic Training Practice-Based Research Network. Patients or Other Participants Patient cases were included if the patient was diagnosed with an injury that occurred during interscholastic cross-country participation. All patients received usual care by an athletic trainer. Main Outcome Measure(s) We used summary statistics to describe injury (sex, age, participation level, time of injury, mechanism of injury, body part, injury type, diagnosis) and treatment (type, amount, duration, number of services) characteristics. Results Most cross-country injuries occurred to the lower extremity and were musculotendinous or ligamentous in nature. The most common injury types were sprain/strain (43.8%), tendinopathy (18.5%), and general pain (9.5%). Injured body parts and diagnoses were typically similar between sexes. The most frequently used treatment was therapeutic exercises or activities (28.7%), and patients received an average of 7.4 ± 17.4 total athletic training services during 5.5 ± 15.1 episodes of care over 27.8 ± 87.5 days. Conclusions Adolescent cross-country student-athletes frequently sustained non–time-loss injuries that required up to 1 month of treatment and management. These findings will generate awareness surrounding the role of athletic trainers in providing care for cross-country athletes."

This study examined whether kinematic differences exist between accurate and inaccurate goal-kicks and determined the relationships between technical factors and accuracy. Eighteen elite to sub-elite AF players performed 15 x 30 m goal-kicks on an AF training ground, with three-dimensional kinematics collected using the Xsens inertial measurement system (Xsens Technologies B.V., Enschede, the Netherlands). A general linear mixed modelling approach and regression-based statistics were employed to quantify differences between accurate and inaccurate goal kicks and the relationships between technical factors and accuracy. Accurate goal-kicks were characterised by a straighter approach line, with less kick-leg joint range of motion (knee and hip), lower linear velocity (centre of mass, foot speed), angular velocity (knee and shank), and less support-leg knee flexion during the kicking phase compared to inaccurate goal-kicks. At the end of the follow through, players produced greater ankle plantarflexion and a straighter-leg line in accurate goal-kicks. Findings in this research indicated that many factors interact with goal-kicking accuracy in AF, ranging from the players’ approach line path, their support-leg mechanics, the kick-leg swing motion, to the final position of the kicker during their follow through."

Scores for both groups were taken at baseline and a median of 2 days after injury.A total of 92 participants who flew (mean [SD] age, 19.1 [1.2] years; 55 male [59.8%]) and 1383 participants who did not fly (mean [SD] age, 18.9 [1.3] years; 809 male [58.5%]) were included in the analysis of symptom recovery outcomes (analysis 1). Similarly, 100 participants who flew (mean [SD] age, 19.2 [1.2] years; 63 male [63.0%]) and 1577 participants who did not fly (mean [SD] age, 18.9 [1.3] years; 916 male [58.1%]) were included in the analysis of symptom severity outcomes (analysis 2). No significant group differences were found regarding recovery outcome measures. Likewise, there were no group differences in symptom (estimated mean difference, 0.029; 95% CI, -0.083 to 0.144; P = .67) or headache (estimated mean difference, -0.007; 95% CI, -0.094 to 0.081; P = .91) severity scores.Airplane travel early after concussion was not associated with recovery or severity of concussion symptoms. These findings may help guide future recommendations on flight travel after concussion in athletes."

A Literature Review,2020-11-06,2020,review,"Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) as an incorrect movement pattern is recognized as a risk factor for lower limb injuries. Therefore, it is important to find the reasons behind this movement to select effective preventive procedures. There is a limited number of publications focusing on specific tasks, separating the double-leg from the single-leg tasks. Test patterns commonly used for DKV assessment, such as single-leg squat (SLS) or single leg landings (SLL), may show different results. The current review presents the modifiable factors of knee valgus in squat and landing single-leg tests in healthy people, as well as exercise training options. The authors used the available literature from PubMed, Scopus, PEDro and clinicaltrials.gov databases, and reviewed physiotherapy journals and books. For the purpose of the review, studies were searched for using 2D or 3D motion analysis methods only in the SLL and SLS tasks among healthy active people. Strengthening and activating gluteal muscles, improving trunk lateral flexion strength, increasing ROM dorsiflexion ankle and midfoot mobility should be taken into account when planning training programs aimed at reducing DKV occurring in SLS. In addition, knee valgus during SLL may occur due to decreased hip abductors, extensors, external rotators strength and higher midfoot mobility. Evidence from several studies supports the addition of biofeedback training exercises to reduce the angles of DKV."

Also, the AI decreased for peak hip flexion moment from 74.5% to 17.1%, peak knee flexion moment from 79.0% to 5.8% and peak ankle dorsiflexion moment from 59.3% to 5.9%. As a further matter, the AI decreased for peak hip abduction moment from 67.8% to 5.1%, peak knee adduction moment from 55.7% to 14.8% and peak knee valgus angle from 48.7% to 23.5%.Results obtained from this longitudinal study showed that ACLR patients still suffer from limb asymmetries during landing tasks, which appear to normalize by 24-monthspost-surgery. This finding can help us to better understand biomechanics of the limbs after ACLR, and design more efficient post-surgery rehabilitation programs.Level III."

Numerous studies have investigated the biomechanical determinants of KJLs in cutting tasks. The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively review the literature regarding biomechanical determinants of KJLs during cutting, in order to develop a cutting technical framework alongside training recommendations for practitioners regarding KJL mitigation. Methods Databases (SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and PubMed) were systematically searched using a combination of the following terms: “Biomechanical determinants”, or “Knee abduction moment”, or “Technical determinants”, or “Knee loading”, or “Knee loads”, or “Mechanical determinants”, or “ACL strain”, or “Knee adduction moment”, or “Anterior tibial shear”, or “Knee internal rotation moment”, or “Knee valgus moment” AND “Change of direction”, or “Cutting manoeuvre”, or “Run and cut”, or “Run-and-cut”, or “Sidestepping”, or “Side-stepping”, or “Shuttle run”. Inclusion criteria were as follows: studies examining a cutting task &lt; 110° with a preceding approach run that examined biomechanical determinants of KJLs using three-dimensional motion analysis. Results The search returned 6404 possibly eligible articles, and 6 identified through other sources. Following duplicate removal, 4421 titles and abstracts were screened, leaving 246 full texts to be screened for inclusion. Twenty-three full texts were deemed eligible for inclusion and identified numerous determinants of KJLs; 11 trunk, 11 hip, 7 knee, 3 multiplanar KJLs, 5 foot/ankle and 7 identifying ground reaction forces (GRFs) as determinants of KJLs. Conclusion Using the framework developed from the results, cutting KJLs can be mitigated through the following: reducing lateral foot-plant distances, thus lowering hip abduction and orientating the foot closer to neutral with a mid-foot or forefoot placement strategy; minimising knee valgus and hip internal rotation angles and motion at initial contact (IC) and weight acceptance (WA); avoiding and limiting lateral trunk flexion and attempt to maintain an upright trunk position or trunk lean into the intended direction; and finally, reducing GRF magnitude during WA, potentially by attenuation through increased knee flexion and emphasising a greater proportion of braking during the penultimate foot contact (PFC)."

https://openalex.org/W3122803604,Comparing the Width of Hamstring Grafts Prepared Using Wet and Dry Gauze Methods in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery,2020-11-01,2020,article,"Background: The anterior cruciate ligament surgery commonly uses a hamstring tendon. The hamstring grafts are usually prepared by wrapping in a wet gauze under tension. Objectives: The placement of a hamstring tendon in a dry gauze affects the size of the graft, without any change in its collagen volume. The present study aimed to prove that the preparation method could affect the hamstring graft width. Methods: A total number of 32 patients who had undergone the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were enrolled in this analytical descriptive study. Initially, the width of the 4-layered extracted graft was measured using the sizer system, after placement under traction. Then, 16 patients were operated on, based on the dry gauze preparation method, and the other 16, based on the wet gauze preparation method. The grafts were remeasured after traction. Six months after the surgery, all patients received a clinical evaluation, in which the integrity of the graft was evaluated based on clinical criteria. Results: The Mean±SD width of the 4-layered extracted grafts was 7.44±0.54 mm and 7.41±0.33 mm in the dry gauze and wet gauze groups, respectively. However, these values did not significantly differ (P=0.96). After traction, the Mean±SD graft width of the dry gauze group was reduced to 6.97±0.62 mm. The traction led to no change in the graft width of the wet gauze group. The changes in the graft size significantly differed between the two groups (P=0.032). Moreover, 4 patients (25%) exhibited no certain endpoint in the Lachman test, also, the pivot shift-test was positive in 5 patients (31.2%). Conclusion: The hamstring graft preparation technique affects the tunnel graft size. Besides, the use of dry gauzes procures the need for a narrower tunnel in the tibia and femur."

Here, we extend a convolutional neural network (CNN) to instantly estimate element-wise distribution of peak maximum principal strain (MPS) of the entire brain (>36 k speedup accomplished on a low-end computing platform). To achieve this, head impact rotational velocity and acceleration temporal profiles are combined into two-dimensional images to serve as CNN input for training and prediction of MPS. Compared with the directly simulated counterparts, the CNN-estimated responses (magnitude and distribution) are sufficiently accurate for 92.1% of the cases via 10-fold cross-validation using impacts drawn from the real world (n = 5661; range of peak rotational velocity in augmented data extended to 2–40 rad/sec). The success rate further improves to 97.1% for “in-range” impacts (n = 4298). When using the same CNN architecture to train (n = 3064) and test on an independent, reconstructed National Football League (NFL) impact dataset (n = 53; 20 concussions and 33 non-injuries), 51 out of 53, or 96.2% of the cases, are sufficiently accurate. The estimated responses also achieve virtually identical concussion prediction performances relative to the directly simulated counterparts, and they often outperform peak MPS of the whole brain (e.g., accuracy of 0.83 vs. 0.77 via leave-one-out cross-validation). These findings support the use of CNN for accurate and efficient estimation of spatially detailed brain strains across the vast majority of head impacts in contact sports. Our technique may hold the potential to transform traumatic brain injury (TBI) research and the design and testing standards of head protective gears by facilitating the transition from acceleration-based approximation to strain-based design and analysis. This would have broad implications in the TBI biomechanics field to accelerate new scientific discoveries.

TBI involves the application and generation of external forces and impulse loads respectively to the head whereby the brain moves relative to the skull. Despite numerous studies, further understanding of TBIs is necessary, requiring consistent attention. Objective: The purpose of this article is to investigate the history of American football helmets and provide an academic and practitioner review as it relates to TBIs. This study is a literature review that also considers perspectives from an autoethnographic frame. Method: An extensive literature review was performed to assess the history of TBI as it relates to American football. This article evaluates helmet design optimization and American football safety as well as an exploration into the sports’ education methods for players and staff alike. Results: Despite developing helmet designs that can better attenuate impact forces, reducing linear and rotational movement, the skull and brain move very differently relative to one another. Helmet designs and tools for measuring forces require further validation techniques to determine resultant forces and movement for the brain. Current biomechanics research lacks sufficient methodology for defining TBI thresholds, making helmet optimization difficult. Conclusion: According to past research, no helmet can eliminate all TBI risk; however, processes are in place lead by the National Football League (NFL) and NFL Players Association to educate players, coaches, and staff at all levels of competition of the protective capabilities of available helmet options."

As the number of primary and recurrent PCL injuries increases, so does the body of literature, with high-quality evidence evolving in recent years. However, the debate about the ideal treatment approach such as; operative vs. non-operative; single-bundle vs. double-bundle reconstruction; transtibial vs. tibial inlay technique, continues. Ultimately, the goal in the treatment of PCL injuries is restoring native knee kinematics and preventing residual posterior and combined rotatory knee laxity through an individualized approach. Certain demographic, anatomical, and surgical risk factors for failures in operative treatment have been identified. Failures after PCL reconstruction are increasing, confronting the treating surgeon with challenges including the need for revision PCL reconstruction. Part 2 of the evidence-based update on the management of primary and recurrent PCL injuries will summarize the outcomes of operative and non-operative treatment including indications, surgical techniques, complications, and risk factors for recurrent PCL deficiency. This paper aims to support surgeons in decision-making for the treatment of PCL injuries by systematically evaluating underlying risk factors, thus preventing postoperative complications and recurrent knee laxity.

As mostly young and active individuals are affected there is an emphasis on the rapid and safe return to sports (RTS). Strengthening the ventral and dorsal thigh muscles is a prerequisite for a successful RTS after ACL reconstruction (ACLR), as persistent muscle weakness may increase the incidence for secondary injuries and impair performance. Aiming to increase evidence on the importance of preoperative muscle strength and the coaching of patients, the purpose of this study is to compare thigh muscle strength pre- and post-operatively after ACLR.We performed a retrospective analysis of 80 patients with primary, isolated ACLR using a four-stranded hamstring autograft. We performed bilateral isokinetic concentric strength measurement (60°/s) before and six months after ACLR. Primary outcomes were the maximal knee extension and flexion torque, hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (H/Q ratio) and the corresponding limb symmetry indices (LSI). Pearson correlations were calculated for pre- and post-surgical values.The operated as well as the unaffected leg increased maximal knee extension (+ 18% ± 7% p < 0.05; + 11% ± 5% p < 0.05) and flexion torque (+ 9% ± 5% p < 0.05, + 10% ± 6% p < 0.05) throughout the 6 months of rehabilitation. The H/Q ratio remained unaffected (- 2% ± 3% p = 0.93; - 4% ± 4% p = 0.27). LSI of knee extension strength increased significantly (6% ± 3% p < 0.05), while flexion strength remained unaffected (+ 2% ± 4% p = 0.27). Positive correlations underline the interrelationship between the strength pre- and post-surgery for the knee extension (r = 0.788 p < 0.05) and knee flexion strength (r = 0.637 p < 0.05) after ACLR.Preoperative leg extension and flexion strength normalized to body mass are strongly correlated to postoperative strength performance after ACLR. Therefore, pre-operative quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength deficits may have a significant negative impact on functional performance following ACLR. This emphasizes the need for intensive preoperative screening and subsequent treatment to achieve the best possible preoperative leg strength before ACLR.DRKS00020210 ."

Twenty-one experienced male soccer players (age: 22.2 ± 2.7) were pair-matched into a strength- (n = 10) and a plyometric (n = 11) training group. CODs of 45°, 90°, 135° and 180° performed from either a 4 m or 20 m approach distance were compared before and after intervention. Results showed no significant difference between groups. Significant effects were only found within the plyometric training group (-3.2% to -4.6%) in 90°, 135° and 180° CODs from 4 m and a 180° COD from a 20 m approach distance. Individual changes in COD performances showed that with the 4 m approach at least 55% and 81% of the strength and plyometric training group, respectively, improved COD performance, while with the 20 m approach at least 66% of both groups improved performance. This study showed that the plyometric training program can improve most CODs, with angles over 90°, although this is dependent on the distance approaching the COD. Considering the limited time of implementing physical conditioning, in addition to regular soccer practice in most soccer environments, the current plyometric training program can be advantageous in improving CODs at maximal intensity."

So far, few studies have investigated differences in the mental representation of a specific motor skill by experienced athletes of other related sports. The goal of the present study is to examine group differences and similarities in the mental representation of the tennis serve between experienced tennis, badminton, and handball athletes as well as a control group without any sport experience. We want to assess the quality of mental representation of technical-related overhead motion task expertise. For this purpose, we used the SDA-M to measure the mental representation of the tennis serve of four different groups (tennis, badminton, and handball athletes and a group of novices). As expected, badminton and handball athletes showed functionally well-structured representations, which were similar to the structure of the group of tennis athletes. Novices showed an unstructured mental representation. These outcomes confirm the relationship between mental representation and performance in the development of overhead motion. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of mental representations as an essential developmental aspect in learning motor skills, especially in learning technical-related motor skills."

Twenty-eight soccer players (14 males and 14 females) performed 180° turns with ground reaction forces collected over penultimate and final contacts. A two-way (contact × limb) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were run to examine differences between contact (penultimate and final) or limb (dominant and non-dominant) for sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle peak angles and moments, and frontal plane knee abduction moments and angles between sexes. Average horizontal GRF was increased on the dominant limb, compared to non-dominant and for the final contact compared to the penultimate contact. Knee abduction angles were increased in females compared to males, while the opposite was true for knee abduction moments. Statistically significant differences were evident, with increases in peak vertical GRF, peak hip flexion angle, peak knee flexion angle, peak knee extensor moment, and peak ankle dorsiflexion angle observed in the penultimate contact compared to final contact. The results indicate the penultimate contact during turns helps reduce loading on the final contact, yet male and female soccer players exhibit different knee joint mechanics during pre-planned change of direction."
https://openalex.org/W3096122048,Investigating the test-retest reliability of Illinois Agility Test for wheelchair users,2020-10-29,2020,article,"The Illinois Agility Test (IAT) is a standard agility course used to assess and train able-bodied athletes as well as wheelchair-sport athletes and rehabilitation of wheelchair users. It has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool to assess the able-bodied population, but the reliability of this test for assessing wheelchair propulsion has never been shown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the test-retest reliability of IAT to assess wheelchair propulsion. In this paper, the test-retest reliability of using IAT for wheelchair users is found for peak and average velocity, acceleration, tangential and total force of the push, each for the left and the right wheel. Each of these variables was found for thirty-two decisive points throughout the IAT path. The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was found to be very strong for 15 out of 16 variables. The average ICC was 89% and the average 95% confidence interval was [44% 96%]. In addition, thirty-seven other significant propulsion parameters were found that are clinically important, such as the number of pushes participants take to go around cones on the right, relative to turning around the cones on the left. Also, all thirty-seven variables were compared between the two sessions using four separate MANOVAs; the results showed no significant difference between IAT performed in the two sessions which were at least one week apart. This, in turn, backs the reliability of IAT for wheelchair users. These results are sufficient evidence to show that IAT is a reliable tool to test wheelchair agility for fifteen variables tested for non-wheelchair users. Since experienced wheelchair users are much more consistent in wheelchair propulsion compared to non-wheelchair-users, the results of this study show that IAT can be used as a reliable tool to assess and train wheelchair users, both for clinical and athletic applications."

How do researchers and practitioners collectively explore the dynamic landscape of inquiry, problem, solution and application? How do they learn to skilfully navigate from current place and practice toward the next idea located beyond their current vantage point? These questions are not just of philosophical value but are important for understanding how to provide high-quality support for athletes and sport participants at all levels of expertise and performance. Grounded in concepts from social anthropology, and theoretically positioned within an ecological dynamics framework, this opinion piece introduces a hunter-gatherer model of human behaviour based on wayfinding, situating it as a conceptual guide for implementing innovations in sport science. Here, we contend that the embedded knowledge of a landscape that guides a successful hunting and gathering party is germane to the pragmatic abduction needed to promote innovation in sport performance, leading to the inquisition of new questions and ways of resolving performance-preparation challenges. More specifically, exemplified through its transdisciplinarity, we propose that to hunt ‘new ideas’ and gather translatable knowledge, sport science researchers and practitioners need to wayfind through uncharted regions located in new performance landscapes. It is through this process of navigation where individuals will deepen, enrich and grow current knowledge, ‘taking home’ new ideas as they find their way."

In addition, training volume is a training variable associated with lean soft tissue (LST), which has been shown to be an important predictor of areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the influential role of lean soft tissue (LST) in the association between training volume and aBMD in male adolescent athletes. Methods This cross-sectional study was composed of 299 male adolescent athletes, mean age 14.1 (1.8) years, from 9 different weight-bearing modalities. The Ethical Board approved the investigation. The adolescents reported the number of days per week they trained and the time spent training and, from this, the training volume (h/wk) was estimated. The LST and aBMD were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Somatic maturation was estimated by the peak of height velocity. Mediation analysis was performed to investigate the role of LST in the association between training volume and aBMD. Level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results LST partially explained the association between training volume and aBMD in all body segments: upper limbs (58.37%; β = 0.00142), lower limbs (28.35%; β = 0.00156), spine (33.80%; β = 0.00124), and whole body (41.82%, β = 0.00131). There was no direct effect of training volume on aBMD in upper limbs (CI -0.00085 to 0.00287). Conclusion: The association between training volume and aBMD is influenced by LST in different body segments, mainly upper limbs, demonstrating that interventions aiming to enhance aBMD should also consider LST as an important variable to be managed."

This study aimed to develop new equations for the somatotype quantification that would reduce the anthropometric measurements required by the Heath and Carter method, integrating the somatotype assessment to the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). One hundred and seventy-six male elite soccer players (age 26.9 ± 4.5 years), registered in the Italian first division (Serie A), underwent anthropometric measurements and BIA. Endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy were obtained according to the Heath and Carter method, while fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) estimated using a BIA-derived equation specific for athletes. The participants were randomly split into development (n = 117) and validation groups (n = 59, 1/3 of sample). The developed models including resistance2/stature, FM%, FFM, contracted arm and calf circumference, triceps, and supraspinal skinfolds had high predictive ability for endomorphy (R2 = 0.83, Standard Error of Estimate (SEE) = 0.16) mesomorphy (R2 = 0.80, SEE = 0.36), and ectomorphy (endomorphy (R2 = 0.87, SEE = 0.22). Cross validation revealed R2 of 0.80, 0.84, 0.87 for endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy, respectively. The proposed strategy allows the integration of somatotype assessment to BIA in soccer players, reducing the number of instruments and measurements required by the Heath and Carter approach."

Methods: Data collection was carried out in the sub 15, sub 17, and sub 20 categories and verified records made by the medical team of the club, which was trained to use the F-MARC form (a form of the medical research center of the International Football Federation-FIFA) at the beginning of the season. To perform the data analysis, the GraphPad Prism software was used. All variables were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results: In relation to the 129 athletes monitored during the season, 62 athletes presented some injury during the season, presenting 42.2 injuries for every 1000 hours of play, the Sub 15 category was the one with the highest incidence of injury, followed by the Sub17 and U20. The average time of leave after injury was 3.65 ± 4.2 weeks, the Defenders were the ones with the highest injury rate. There were 27 articular injuries (43.54%), 25 muscle injuries (40.32%), 9 bone injuries (15.41%), and one pathological injury (1.61%), and the most affected regions were ankle and knee. Conclusion: It is concluded that the moment of the game is the moment when the greatest number of injuries occurs, having a greater incidence in the athletes of the category Sub 15, the Defenders suffered more injuries and the Lower Limbs were more affected, mainly by articular traumas."
https://openalex.org/W3093559451,Decomposing the variability of match physical performance in professional soccer: Implications for monitoring individuals,2020-10-24,2020,article,"The aims of this study were to establish sources of variability in match physical performance of professional soccer players and provide a method for monitoring individual between-match changes. Eleven players meeting the final inclusion criteria were monitored through an entire in-season competition phase (n = 240 individual match observations). Ten Hertz global positioning systems were used to measure match total distance (TD), total high-speed running distance (≥ 21 km·h-1; HSRD), total accelerations (TAcc) and maximum running velocity (Vmax). Between-player, between-position, between-match and within-player variability were determined through linear mixed effects models. These data were then used to establish the practical significance of individual changes using a Minimum Effects Testing framework. All sources of variability were greater for HSRD (13-36%) when compared with all other metrics (<6%). Using combined between-match and within-player variability along with the smallest worthwhile change (0.2 × between-player SD), between-match individual changes of ±∼10-15% in TD, TAcc and Vmax were established as practically significant. For HSRD, these thresholds were considerably higher (≥60%). In conclusion, the ability for soccer practitioners to identify meaningful changes in match physical performance can aid decision making around player management following competition. Our study provides a method to flag changes beyond the normal match-to-match variability and by a substantial magnitude. This may have implications for recovery but should be combined with other sources of data (internal load and response) and used only as an adjunct to practitioner domain knowledge/experience."

The aim of this study was to compare the average peak force (Fpeak) among three punches and to estimate the probability of achieving a skull bone fracture force of 5.1 kN for each type of strike in male and female athletes. A total of 60 males and 31 females (26 ± 8 years, 75 ± 20 kg, 177 ± 11 cm) practicing professional self-defense at the advanced and professional levels performed 15 strikes on a force plate. The analyses of 1360 trials showed significant differences among the strikes Fpeak in females (p &lt; 0.01) and males (p &lt; 0.01). Straight punches had lower Fpeak than palm strikes and elbow strikes in both genders, and palm strikes had higher Fpeak than elbow strikes in females. No difference was observed between palm strikes and elbow strikes in males (p = 0.09). The ground and pound strikes resulted in higher impacts than previously reported strikes in the standing position. Male athletes can deliver a Fpeak above 5.1 kN with a probability of 36% with elbow and palm strikes. Such forces can cause head injury; therefore, the use of these strikes in competition should be carefully considered."

Following successful rehabilitation, systematic changes have been observed in the kinetics and kinematics of pre‐planned change of direction maneuvers, providing insight into potential foci for rehabilitation monitoring and for the assessment of interventions. However, changing direction in field sports is often reactive rather than pre‐planned, and it is not known whether such post‐rehabilitation changes are seen in reactive maneuvers. We analyzed the stance phase kinetics and kinematics of a 90° reactive cutting maneuver in 35 AGP patients before and after a successful exercise intervention program. Following the intervention, transverse plane rotation of the pelvis toward the intended direction of travel increased, and the body center of mass was positioned more anteriorly relative to the center of pressure. Ankle dorsiflexion also increased, and participants demonstrated greater ankle plantar flexor internal moment and power during the second half of stance. These findings provide insight into mechanical variables of potential importance in AGP, as identified during a maneuver based on a common sporting task."

This learning process is the product of the interrelationship between many different constraints that are reflected in a particular stage of skill acquisition and performance that each agent or athlete achieves. We will also show the differences and similarities between both post-cognitivist approaches. The first paragraphs on enactivism deal with several key points related to learning, enactive skills, and what it means to be an athlete in action and in situation. The sections on the ecological approach deal with the education of attention, calibration, and the education of intention. We also discuss the importance of representative experimental designs in studies on ecological approach. In the discussion section, we discuss some of the elements that have shaped both approaches, one of them being the methodological circularity that has allowed enactivist researchers to obtain first and third person data. With regard to the rapprochement between enactivists and ecologists, the use of common terms such as affordances conjures up the possibility of a shared future. Finally, we provide a number of general conclusions, one of the most important of which suggests an alliance between enaction and ecological psychology."

High-risk landing events containing biomechanical potential for noncontact knee soft-tissue injury (STI) occur frequently. Subsequently, noncontact knee STI is common after knee abduction collapse during landing tasks. Lower-limb mobility, strength, balance, movement, and hop test characteristics (intrinsic, modifiable risk factors) are associated with high-risk landing biomechanics and noncontact knee STI events. Such risk factors should be considered in netball-specific noncontact knee STI prevention preparticipation screening. Corresponding training methods should be included as indicated in netball-specific multimodal noncontact knee STI prevention programs. This article provides insight into noncontact knee injury–related aspects of netball and gives detailed suggestions for injury prevention screening and programming."

We present a case of a 15-year-old male who sustained an avulsion injury to his right AIIS when kicking a soccer ball. The patient had chronic pain and extra-articular subspinal impingement leading to decreased hip flexion and rotation. The injury occurred 1.5 years prior to symptom onset, and we were the first health care providers to manage the injury. We attempted six months of nonoperative management including activity modifications and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy without improvement. Although this injury can often be managed nonoperatively, his symptoms required excision of the AIIS and associated heterotopic ossification. He had an excellent outcome with return to soccer and no pain at his final follow-up visit two years after surgery. Due to the limited literature guiding the surgeon’s management of AIIS avulsion injuries with associated heterotopic ossification, we provide a review of the literature detailing pre- and postoperative ranges of motion, surgical approach, fixation or excision of the avulsion fragment, and return to sport in this patient population."

An estimated 1.1 million to 1.9 million SRCs occur per year in children <18 years old in the United States. The post-concussive state has demonstrated consequences in several domains, including athletics and academics, although much more research has been conducted on the former. The objective of this scoping review was to ascertain findings from published studies on the effects of SRCs on academic performance and quality of life of young student athletes. A total of 175 articles were screened within the PubMed and CINAHL databases, along with a Google search. Fourteen papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in the review. Quantitative and qualitative data were collated and demonstrated the heterogeneity with which, post-concussion academic performance outcomes were measured; only 4 of the 14 studies utilized formal academic metrics such as changes in grade point average (GPA) or examination scores. While the results overall did show statistically significant implications on academic performance decline after SRC, it is clear that there remains a paucity of research determining the consequences of SRCs on academic performance in the school environment. Further research is needed to better understand how to implement accommodations in the student's learning environment and guide return-to-learn protocols for student athletes following SRC."

The purpose of this study was to explore potential developmental sequences for forceful kicking using a prelongitudinal screening method. Data were derived from videotapes of 255 children (girls n = 138, boys: n = 117), ages 4–11 years. Seven potential component sequences in their respective developmental order were initially proposed based on biomechanical and motor developmental principles. Each participant was digitally videoed performing five kicks with maximal effort. Trained research staff coded the initial seven components for each kick and the mode of each participant’s five kicks was used for data analysis. Component level probability curves for each component sequence across age were evaluated using the threshold based generalized partial credit model (Muraki, 1992) within the item response theory framework. As developmental theory would indicate, component levels generally increased with age for most components. Six component ordinal sequence progressions met model requirements (Rel = 0.88, item fit; p &gt; 0.05). Ordinal levels for two components ( Knee action and Follow-through) were altered based on initial empirical model structure fit and the Ball contact component was removed based on a lack of model fit. This study provides sufficient cross-sectional evidence for six component developmental sequences that adequately describe the development of kicking using cross-sectional data. Longitudinal data are required to provide further developmental validation for these sequences."

Women were followed for ACL injury starting 90 days after OC initiation or IUD insertion until OC or IUD discontinuation or end of continuous enrollment. Adjusted hazard ratios (adjHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated controlling for age. Secondary analysis replicated previously-published case-control studies assessing ""ever"" versus ""never"" OC use over 1- and 5-year periods among women who underwent ACL reconstruction compared to age-matched controls.In the cohort analysis, 2,370,286 women initiated OCs and 621,798 underwent IUD insertion. There were 3571 (0.15%) ACL injuries during an average 370.6 days of continuous OC use and 1620 (0.26%) during an average 590.5 days of IUD use. No difference in risk of ACL injury was observed between OC initiators and IUD users (adjHR = 0.95; 95%CI 0.89, 1.01). The case-control analysis replicated the slight protective association observed in prior studies over a 5-year period (OR = 0.90; 95%CI 0.85, 0.94).This cohort study suggests no association between OC use and ACL injury, while the case-control study suggested bias from uncontrolled confounding and selection factors may have influenced previous findings that suggested a protective association between OC use and ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W3092731166,Factors affecting peak impact force during soccer headers and implications for the mitigation of head injuries,2020-10-16,2020,article,"It has been documented that up to 22% of all soccer injuries are concussions. This is in part due to players purposely using their head to direct the ball during play. To provide a more complete understanding of head trauma in soccer athletes, this study characterized the effects of four soccer ball characteristics (size, inflation pressure, mass, velocity) on the resulting peak impact force as it relates to the potential for incurring neurophysiological changes. A total of six hundred trials were performed on size 4 and 5 soccer balls as well as a novel lightweight soccer ball. Impact force was measured with a force plate and ball velocity was determined using motion capture. These data were used, in conjunction with dimensional analysis to relate impact force to ball size, mass, velocity, and pressure. Reasonable reductions in allowable ball parameters resulted in a 19.7% decrease in peak impact force. Adjustments to ball parameters could reduce a high cumulative peak translational acceleration soccer athlete down into a previously defined safer low loading range. In addition, it was noted that water absorption by soccer balls can result in masses that substantially increase impact force and quickly surpass the NCAA weight limit for game play. Additional research is required to determine whether varying soccer ball characteristics will enable soccer players to avoid persistent neurophysiological deficits or what additional interventions may be necessary and the legal implications of these data are discussed."

However, an understanding of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that influence BOG is lacking, which limits the development of corrective strategies. Objective To determine if BOG varies by sex and running speed and the influence of running kinematics and anthropometrics on BOG. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Record review of routinely collected performance data from a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I intercollegiate athletic program. Patients or Other Participants A total of 166 Division I collegiate athletes (basketball, cross-country, football, soccer). Main Outcome Measure(s) Running biomechanics (N = 166) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived anthropometric data (n = 68) were extracted. Running variables were BOG, step rate, stride length, foot-inclination angle, center-of-mass vertical displacement, heel-to-center of mass anteroposterior distance, and peak stance-phase angles: hip flexion, hip adduction, pelvic drop, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion. Extracted anthropometric variables were height; leg, femur, and tibia length; and anterior-superior iliac spine, hip-joint, and greater trochanter width. We calculated linear mixed-effects models to assess the influence of sex and running speed on BOG and identify the kinematic and anthropometric variables most associated with BOG. Results A significant interaction between sex and running speed on BOG was observed, with males demonstrating a smaller BOG than females at faster speeds and BOG decreasing overall with speed. The kinematic measures most associated with BOG at preferred running speed were foot-inclination angle at initial contact and peak stance-phase hip adduction and ankle dorsiflexion. Anterior-superior iliac spine width was the anthropometric variable most associated with BOG at preferred running speed. Conclusions Sex and running speed must be considered when determining the appropriateness of an individual's BOG. Additionally, BOG was associated with several potentially modifiable kinematic parameters."

There is evidence that the prevalence of symptoms post-exposure may be sex-specific. Our laboratory has focused on changes in the monoamine and the neuropeptide, galanin, systems in male rodents following primary bTBI. In this study, we aimed to replicate these findings in female rodents. Brainstem sections from the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) were processed for in situ hybridisation at 1 and 7 days post-bTBI. We investigated changes in the transcripts for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase two (TPH2) and galanin. Like in males, we found a transient increase in TH transcript levels bilaterally in the female LC. Changes in TPH2 mRNA were more pronounced and extensive in the DRN of females compared to males. Galanin mRNA was increased bilaterally in the LC and DRN, although this increase was not apparent until day 7 in the LC. Serum analysis revealed an increase in corticosterone, but only in exposed females. These changes occurred without any visible signs of white matter injury, cell death, or blood-brain barrier breakdown. Taken together, in the apparent absence of visible structural damage to the brain, the monoamine and galanin systems, two key players in emotional regulation, are activated deferentially in males and females following primary blast exposure. These similarities and differences should be considered when developing and evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for bTBI."

The TEP questionnaire is an instrument which is used to assess, in a quick and simple fashion, the psychological state of athletes prior to competing. Its psychometric properties were evaluated by means of an analysis of internal consistency, an Exploratory Factor Analysis and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The EFA's results showed a factorial structure consisting of two principal factors and reliability coefficients, both globally and at the factor level, which can be considered acceptable (global = 0.81; Factor 1 = 0.85; and Factor 2 = 0.73). The CFA confirmed the model proposed by the EFA so that the items were distributed around these factors, giving rise to one factor which includes variables that have a positive relationship with performance, and another with variables that negatively affect performance. Meanwhile, regarding the difference between the pre-competitive psychological state of amateurs and professionals, professional athletes presented higher levels of Motivation (p= 0.5 and d= -0.23). It is concluded that the TEP is a suitable tool for the evaluation of pre-competitive psychological states. However, in future research, this study should be complemented by analysing the TEP's predictive validity in terms of the performance of athletes and/or teams, as well as its use as a tool available to athletes and coaches."

The aim of the study is to compare perceptual-cognitive skills of experts with decisional responsibilities (setters in volleyball) with that of other volleyball experts. Eighty-two participants (26 setters, 36 other players and 20 controls) viewed 50 volleyball video sequences. Sequences stopped 120 ms before ball contact and participants, whose eye movements were recorded, had to predict the ball direction. Generalized Estimating Equations analysis revealed that setters and controls made more but shorter fixations than other players. However, both expert groups made better predictions than controls. Dynamics analyses of eye movements over time show that, right before ball contact, opposing players’ upper body is a most relevant attentional cue in all game situations. Results are discussed in terms of decision-making responsibilities to identify key decision-makers in volleyball and in general. They point towards specific perceptual-cognitive abilities found in setters and support the idea that they constitute a subgroup of experts, but that they are not “better” than other players in anticipating the game."

However, the mechanism of this observation is unknown. We conducted a systematic review examining the association between (1) the biomechanical and functional safety of unplanned sports-related movements (e.g., jumps/runs with a spontaneously indicated landing leg/cutting direction) and (2) markers of perceptual–cognitive function (PCF). A literature search in three databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) identified five relevant articles. The study quality, rated by means of a modified Downs and Black checklist, was moderate to high (average: 13/16 points). Four of five papers, in at least one parameter, found either an association of PCF with task safety or significantly reduced task safety in low vs. high PCF performers. However, as (a) the outcomes, populations and statistical methods of the included trials were highly heterogeneous and (b) only two out of five studies had an adequate control condition (pre-planned movement task), the evidence was classified as conflicting. In summary, PCF may represent a factor affecting injury risk and performance during unplanned sports-related movements, but future research strengthening the evidence for this association is warranted."

The generation of anatomically accurate and subject-specific head models with conforming hexahedral meshes remains a significant challenge. The focus of this study is to present two developmental works: first, an anatomically detailed FE head model with conforming hexahedral meshes that has smooth interfaces between the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid, embedded with white matter (WM) fiber tracts; second, a morphing approach for subject-specific head model generation via a new hierarchical image registration pipeline integrating Demons and Dramms deformable registration algorithms. The performance of the head model is evaluated by comparing model predictions with experimental data of brain-skull relative motion, brain strain, and intracranial pressure. To demonstrate the applicability of the head model and the pipeline, six subject-specific head models of largely varying intracranial volume and shape are generated, incorporated with subject-specific WM fiber tracts. DICE similarity coefficients for cranial, brain mask, local brain regions, and lateral ventricles are calculated to evaluate personalization accuracy, demonstrating the efficiency of the pipeline in generating detailed subject-specific head models achieving satisfactory element quality without further mesh repairing. The six head models are then subjected to the same concussive loading to study the sensitivity of brain strain to inter-subject variability of the brain and WM fiber morphology. The simulation results show significant differences in maximum principal strain and axonal strain in local brain regions (one-way ANOVA test, p < 0.001), as well as their locations also vary among the subjects, demonstrating the need to further investigate the significance of subject-specific models. The techniques developed in this study may contribute to better evaluation of individual brain injury and the development of individualized head protection systems in the future. This study also contains general aspects the research community may find useful: on the use of experimental brain strain close to or at injury level for head model validation; the hierarchical image registration pipeline can be used to morph other head models, such as smoothed-voxel models."

The distinction between the natural and the artificial is central to the philosophy of technology and an interesting heuristic to discuss important notions about the growing process of technologization in sport. For example, if one accepts the natural-artificial distinction, one is against any genetic intervention to improve sports performance because one would consider it unnatural.

Methods One-hundred and fifteen football players (66 boys, 49 girls) mean age 14 ± 0.7 (range 13–16) years from youth teams were tested at the start of the second half of the competitive season. A test battery including agility t-test, 505 agility test, single-leg hop for distance test, side-hop test, countermovement jump test, 10-m sprint test, 20-m sprint test, tuck jump assessment (TJA) and drop vertical jump (DVJ) was completed. Results Correlations between the seven different performance tests of agility, jump and sprint ability were generally moderate to strong (r = 0.534–0.971). DVJ did not correlate with the performance tests (rho = 0.004 to – 0.101) or with TJA total score (rho = 0.127). There were weak to moderate correlations between TJA total score and the performance tests ( r = – 0.323–0.523). Boys performed better than girls in all performance tests ( p &lt; 0.001 ) and in TJA total score ( p = 0.002 ). In boys, older players performed better than younger players in the majority of the tests, while there was no clear age influence among girls. Conclusion Sprint performance was moderately to strongly correlated with agility and jump performance, and performance tests were weakly to moderately correlated to TJA, while DVJ did not correlate with the other tests. Boys performed better than girls on performance tests and TJA. An age effect on performance was evident in boys but not in girls.

The present study aimed to evaluate the, performances, metabolic responses, and CK and LDH activities produced through two supra-maximum HIIT protocols in recreational endurance runners. Fifteen recreational male runners performed two HIIT protocols in randomized order with multiple conditions: 1) H15 (n=15) with a HIIT protocol of 15:15 work-recovery duration, and 2) H30 (n=15) with a HIIT protocol of 30:30 work-recovery duration. Both protocols were performed in similar intensity (130% vV̇O2max) and with one set until voluntary exhaustion. Blood samples were collected and estimated the levels and activities of blood lactate (BLac: mmol. L-1), glucose (GLU: mg. dL-1), creatine kinase (CK: U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: U/L). BLac and GLU were collected at pre, five and ten moments after the H15 and H30 protocols were performed. Blood collections used to measure the activities of CK and LDH enzymes were verified in the pre, 24 and 48 h after the protocols. Distance traveled (m), total time (s), and bouts performed (rep) were also registered. Significant differences between conditions H15 and H30 were observed in the bouts performed (p=0.001; ES=1.19). Several statistical differences were found over time for BLac [pre vs. post5' (both conditions: p=0.001), pre vs. post10' (both conditions: p=0.001), and post5' vs. post10' (H30: p=0.004)], CK [pre vs. post24 (H15: p<0.001; ES=0.97 and H30: p=0.001; ES=0.74) post 24 vs post48 (H30: p=0.03; ES=0.56)], and LDH [pre vs. post24 (H15: p=0.008; ES=1.07 and H30: p=0.022; ES=0.85). No statistical differences between conditions were observed for any blood parameter. In conclusion, both protocols generated similar performance and physiological responses, however, H30 showed a significant reduction in lactate and CK activities after 10 min and 48 h, respectively."

Exercise and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) are among the most common treatments used to mediate tendon healing and regeneration. The review presents current understanding of mechanisms of action of ESWT and exercise in isolation and briefly synthesises evidence of their effectiveness for various tendinopathies. The central purpose of the review is to synthesise research findings investigating the combination of ESWT and exercise for five common tendinopathies (plantar heel pain, rotator cuff, lateral elbow, Achilles, and patellar tendinopathy) and provide recommendations on clinical applicability. Collectively, the available evidence indicates that ESWT combined with exercise in the form of eccentric training, tissue specific stretching or heavy slow resistance training are effective for specific tendinopathies and can therefore be recommended in treatment. Whilst there are at present a limited number of studies investigating combined EWST and exercise approaches, there is evidence to suggest that the combination improves outcomes in treatment of plantar heel pain, Achilles, lateral elbow, and rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, despite overall positive outcomes in patellar tendinopathy, the combined treatment has not been shown at present to offer additional benefit over eccentric exercise alone."
https://openalex.org/W3093244356,Arbitration in its Psychological Context,2020-10-08,2020,book-chapter,"Abstract This concluding chapter presents a program for a more ‘contextual’ approach to the application of psychology to arbitration than has been adopted within arbitration scholarship thus far. It specifically examines the area of Contextual Behavioral Science (CBS), which focuses on the ‘act in context’, treating behaviour as inseparable from the circumstances that surround it. Such a context-sensitive approach allows new light to be shed on the psychology of arbitration, while also unifying the existing literature within a new epistemic framework that offers the advantage of not only predicting but also of potentially influencing the behaviour of interest in arbitration. While psychology can be applied to arbitration in many ways, the chapter focuses on arbitrator reasoning. It addresses the professional context of arbitration, scrutinizing how individual conceptions of the role of the arbitrator can influence reasoning. The chapter also considers the social context of arbitration, analysing the relations between the hierarchical character of the arbitration community and the existence of cognitive biases."

If not treated correctly, it often leads to recurrent twisting of the ankle joint, causingdisruption of the ligaments in the ankle joint. Various anthropometric factors such as height, weight, BMI, aswell as previous ankle sprain history are assessed as potential predictors of recurrent lateral ankle sprain. Thepotential factors are correlated with the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure- Sports Sub Scale to assess theircontribution to a recurrent lateral ankle sprain in athletes. The FAAM Sport subscale is used to determinethe functioning of the ankle joint, as recorded by the subjects themselves.Methodology: The questionnaire is sent to the candidates who fall under the inclusion criteria, and they areasked to fill the questionnaire. The participants were between the age of 18-30 years. Both male, as well asfemale athletes were included in the study. Each athlete must have played at least 3 competitive sports in thelast 1 year, and they must have a history of at least 1 lateral ankle sprain. The collected data is then compiledand analyzed.Result: After the analysis of the data, previous ankle sprain history depicted maximum correlation withthe FAAM- Sport Subscale, as well as an inverse relationship, with a reading of -2.89, and significance of0.27. Height depicted an inverse relationship as well, with -.119 when compared to FAAM Sport Sub-scale.Weight also shows an inverse relationship (-0.053) when correlated with the FAAM Sport sub-scale. BMIdoes not show any correlation with the FAAM Sport Subscale (+0.002).Conclusion: Previous ankle sprain history, height and weight depict an inverse relationship with the FAAMSport Subscale, indicating that, as their score increases, the functioning of the ankle joint decreases, andhence becoming a potential factor for recurrent ankle sprains. BMI however, does not depict any correlationwith the FAAM sport sub-scale."

These data hold great potential for enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between training and performance. Here we demonstrate feasibility of this idea by applying a previously validated mathematical model to real-world running activities of ≈ 14,000 individuals with ≈ 1.6 million exercise sessions containing duration and distance, with a total distance of ≈ 20 million km. Our model depends on two performance parameters: an aerobic power index and an endurance index. Inclusion of endurance, which describes the decline in sustainable power over duration, offers novel insights into performance: a highly accurate race time prediction and the identification of key parameters such as the lactate threshold, commonly used in exercise physiology. Correlations between performance indices and training volume and intensity are quantified, pointing to an optimal training. Our findings hint at new ways to quantify and predict athletic performance under real-world conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3092740079,"Incidence, mechanisms and risk factors for shoulder injuries in community Australian football players",2020-10-06,2020,dissertation,"Background: Australian football is a physically demanding sport. Exposure to multidirectional body contact and the necessity for complex upper body skills can result in significant strain on regions such as the shoulder. Despite the rise in incidence and high recurrence of shoulder injuries reported at the elite Australian Football League (AFL) level there is limited evidence available to determine whether shoulder injuries are also a problem at a community level. The financial ramifications of shoulder injuries for the community AFL player and society can be considerable due to time off work, treatment costs and the high number and expense of emergency department presentations.
Objectives: The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the profile (incidence, severity, mechanisms and clinical management) of shoulder complex injuries in community-level AFL players using automated injury surveillance (SMS text messaging and online survey). The thesis also aimed to investigate whether factors identified during preseason (i.e. musculoskeletal screening, measurement of habitual activity levels, or in-season training workload) were related to shoulder, head or neck time-loss injuries.
Methods: Study 1 and 2 prospectively evaluated a novel, automated method of injury surveillance in community AFL players (during a 20-week season) to assess method feasibility (Chapter 3) and to evaluate the profile of shoulder injuries (Chapter 4). In study 3, video footage of elite AFL players (n = 26) retrospectively examined the biomechanical aetiology of injuries to the shoulder complex (Chapter 5). The final two prospective cohort studies (4 and 5) examined potential risk factors for upper body injuries with similar injury mechanisms. At baseline, community AFL players were assessed using seven screening tests of the upper body, trunk and whole-body function to identify any relationships with in-season injuries to the shoulder, head, or neck (Chapter 6). Screening reference values were also determined. Pre-season habitual activity levels and in-season training workloads were collected to prospectively identify associations with in-season injuries to the upper or lower body regions (Chapter 7).
Results: The automated method of injury surveillance was deemed feasible for reporting injuries in community AFL players. The incidence of injuries to the shoulder complex was reported to be high (2nd highest in matches, 4th overall; 10.4% of all injuries). The severity of these shoulder injuries was mostly mild (<3 games missed), but a substantial number required medical attention (emergency department or doctor). Results also indicated activity mechanisms of injury were body region dependent with the majority of upper body injuries (shoulder, head and neck) due to collision contact. Injuries common to lower body regions (thigh, knee and ankle) were from non-contact/ overuse mechanisms. Video analysis of biomechanical aetiology identified that the majority of shoulder injuries occurred with the arm below 100 degrees flexion/ abduction and were caused by lateral contact (34.6%) and hyperflexion/ abduction (19.2%) mechanisms; potentially unavoidable contact injuries. This study found limited evidence to support the use of the suite of musculoskeletal screening tests selected for the upper body, trunk and whole-body function to identify risk of in-season injuries to the shoulder, head or neck. Furthermore, the results identified the variable nature of total workload characteristics in community AFL players, however, no total workload relationships were identified with common in-season injuries to the upper or lower body.
Conclusions: Shoulder injuries are problematic for community AFL players and the use of feasible methods of injury surveillance may help overcome the challenges associated with collecting shoulder injury data in community team sport. The musculoskeletal screening tests and measures of training and habitual workload selected and investigated in this thesis, however, were unable to adequately detect players ‘at-risk’ of an in-season injury to the shoulder, head or neck region. Future studies could investigate different intrinsic risk factors to the ones selected in this study and results also suggest that examination of extrinsic factors (such as rule changes) could possibly be indicated with an aim of preventing shoulder injuries. Furthermore, results from video analysis of elite players may suggest that prophylactic strategies should be customised to the positions of shoulder injury and also focus on lateral contact injury prevention in community AFL players. Findings from this thesis may help to inform the development of injury prevention strategies and guide future research directions with an aim of decreasing injuries to the shoulder complex in community AFL players."

On-ice and off-ice fitness profiles of elite and U20 male ice hockey players of two different national standards. J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3369–3376, 2020—Differences in body composition and performance were investigated between elite and U20 male ice hockey players of 2 different national standards. One hundred seventy-nine players were recruited from the highest Finnish ( n = 82) and Danish ( n = 61) national level, as well as from 1 U20 team from Finland ( n = 19) and Denmark ( n = 17). Body composition and countermovement jump performance (CMJ) were measured off-ice in addition to on-ice assessments of agility, 10- and 30-m sprint performance, and endurance capacity (the maximal Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Level 1 Ice Hockey Test, Yo-Yo IR1-IH max ). Large differences in on-ice performances were demonstrated between Finnish and Danish elite players for agility, 10- and 30-m sprint performance (2–3%, P ≤ 0.05), and Yo-Yo IR1-IH max performance (15%, P ≤ 0.05). By contrast, no differences ( P &gt; 0.05) were present between elite players for CMJ ability or body composition. However, elite players possessed more body and muscle mass than U20 players. Finally, the Finnish U20 cohort had a similar performance level as the Danish elite players and superior 10-m sprint performance, whereas the Danish U20 level was inferior to the other groups in every performance assessment ( P ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, on-ice speed and endurance differ markedly between elite players of 2 different national standards with no distinction in body composition or CMJ ability. Moreover, the most consistent difference between U20 and senior elite players was related to body and muscle mass. These results highlight the usefulness of on-ice assessments and suggest the importance of on-ice high-intensity training in elite players in addition to training targeted the development of lean body mass in youth prospects."

It evolved over the last decade through observation and experience of the limitations of hierarchical models of leadership across a diverse range of sectors. During this time, the three Creative Leadership attributes of empathy, clarity, and creativity have been explored through a range of primary and secondary research methods. The next stage of research and development involves a multidisciplinary convergence of design thinking with neuroscience that relates to brain plasticity, neural connectivity, and emotional intelligence theory. The aim is to develop a comprehensive grid of key performance indicators of CL. Dr. Melanie Flory, neuroscience project partner, explains that the three attributes are learnable and correlate positively with well‐being‐sustaining values and behaviors in individuals and groups. When the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of these traits are identified and understood, a three‐dimensional complementary feedback loop of learn–retain–apply can ensue through experiential learning and development.

Patient demographics as well as preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative findings, including patient-reported outcomes and recurrence rates, were analyzed by 2 independent reviewers. Recurrence was defined as an episode of dislocation, subluxation or instability following primary arthroscopic anterior shoulder stabilization. Study methodological quality was evaluated with the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS). Risk bias was evaluated using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS score). Descriptive statistics are presented.ResultsTen studies (1 Level I, 1 Level II, 5 Level III, and 3 Level IV), including a total of 7,102 patients with primary traumatic and/or recurrent traumatic shoulder instability without previous procedures who underwent primary arthroscopic anterior shoulder stabilization, were included (mean follow-up, 34.6 months; mean age, 25.4 years). There was a total of 5,097 males (71.8%) and 2,005 females (28.2%). There was a higher recurrence rate in males (6%-37%) compared to females (0-32%). Clinical outcomes were inconsistently reported, so no quantitative analysis of clinical outcomes or return-to-sport between sexes was possible. The average MCMS of all 10 studies was 76.8 ± 8.0, indicating good methodology.ConclusionsMales may have higher recurrence rates than females following primary arthroscopic anterior shoulder stabilization; however, the heterogeneity of the included studies precludes any definitive conclusions.Level of evidenceIV, Systematic Review of Level I-IV."

Methods Young male football players participated at baseline ( n = 89, 12–19 years of age), 2.5-year ( n = 63) and 5-year follow-up ( n = 49). Standardized anteroposterior pelvic and frog-leg lateral radiographs were obtained at each time-point. Cam morphology was quantified by an alpha angle ≥ 60°, and large cam morphology ≥ 78°. The neck–shaft angle (NSA), epiphyseal extension (EE), lateral center–edge angle (LCEA) and hip internal rotation (IR) were also measured. Cross-sectional associations between NSA, EE, LCEA and IR and (large) cam morphology were studied at all time-points. To study whether these variables preceded cam morphology development, hips without cam morphology at baseline were studied prospectively. Results A lower NSA, a higher EE and limited IR were consistently associated with cam morphology at all three time-points. These differences were more pronounced in hips with large cam morphology. No association between cam morphology and the LCEA was found. None of the parameters studied preceded cam morphology development. Conclusion Cam morphology developed simultaneously with a varus orientation, growth plate extension towards the femoral neck and limited hip internal rotation. These parameters did not precede cam morphology development. The hip parameters studied cannot be used to identify individuals at risk of developing cam morphology. Level of Evidence: Level II."

Additionally, in a rehabilitation setting, closed chain upper extremity functional testing is often used as a return to play criterion. Lower extremity sway measures (biomechanical and clinical) have been published widely and have established reliability and validity; however, the reliability of upper extremity sway biomechanical measures has not been investigated to date.The purpose of this study was to determine the repeatability of a variety of force plate measurements during an upper extremity task in an athletic population. It was hypothesized that variables measuring upper extremity sway in a closed kinetic chain position would have excellent reliability.Cross-sectional.All data were collected using a force plate system with commercially available software. Four hundred and ninety healthy Division I athletes were tested for both their dominant and non-dominant upper extremity at one of two testing sessions. Subjects were instructed to stay as still as possible while maintaining a full plank position with one upper extremity on the force plate and the contralateral upper extremity behind their back. Two, 20-second trials were performed for each extremity. Variables measured included average sway velocity (ASV), sway velocity in medial-lateral (SVML) and anterior-posterior (SVAP) directions, sway velocity at 1st and 2nd time intervals for AP (VAP1 and 2) and ML (VML1 and 2) directions, and sway frequency in the AP direction for 1st and 2nd time intervals (FreAP1 and 2). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(2,1)) and their 95% confident intervals were calculated for all force plate variables for 980 limbs.No difference was seen between left and right extremities for any measure (p > 0.05). ICC's ranged from 0.61-0.90 for all variables, indicating moderate to excellent reliability for all variables.Upper extremity sway biomechanical variables using a force plate system have moderate to excellent reliability. These results are important prior to validation and clinical utilization of these measures including baseline testing, return to play guidelines, and injury prevention parameters.3."

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between selected functional tests and lower limb injuries in elite male wushu athletes. Methods: In total, 40 wushu player were recruited from the national league (Mean±SD age: 25.1±4.9 y, weight: 67.3±7.7 kg, height: 175.3±4.7 cm). Functional Movement Screening (FMS), Tuck jump, single and double leg squats, Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and Stork balance tests were performed in this research. All of the study variables were measured before the national competition, and after the competition, the rate of the injuries were assessed. The correlation between them was evaluated, subsequently. Descriptive data were used to describe the collected results. Besides, multivariate linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between the study variables. Results: Multivariate linear regression analysis data suggested that LESS, stroke balance test, single-leg squat, and SEBT failed to predict lower extremities injuries; however, Tuck jump, FMS, and double leg squat could predict lower extremities injuries. Conclusion: Based on the collected results, among the studied tests, trainers and researchers are suggested to employ the Tuck jump, FMS, and double leg squat tests to predict injuries in wushu male players; this test can also be used to prevent injuries in players."

https://openalex.org/W3106291243,Effect of Age at Menarche on Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Incidence and Anterior Knee Laxity in Collegiate Athletes,2020-10-01,2020,article,"Female athletes suffer painful, costly, and career-limiting non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries more often than males. Previous research suggests that pubertal neuromusculoskeletal development contributes to this sex-bias, but the manner in which variation in pubertal development affects injury risk within females is poorly understood. Age at menarche is a variable, significant pubertal developmental event, signaling the onset of estrogen cycling and affecting musculoskeletal development. Earlier menarche may increase injury risk, possibly by increasing anterior knee laxity through prolonged estrogen exposure. The purpose of this case-control study was to test the primary hypothesis that collegiate athletes with previous ACL injuries have earlier age at menarche than their uninjured peers, and to test the secondary hypothesis that earlier menarche is related to greater anterior knee laxity in injured and uninjured athletes. The study sample consisted of female NCAA Division-I varsity athletes (N=14 injured, N=120 uninjured). Outcome measures included: menstrual history and ACL injury details (injury age, activity at time of injury, contact vs. non-contact), assessed by questionnaire; and anterior knee laxity assessed by KT-1000 arthrometer. Correlation, t-tests, and regression analysis were used to test for associations between age at menarche, injury incidence, and knee laxity. Fourteen athletes reported ≥1 non-contact ACL injury, and had significantly earlier menarche than uninjured athletes (12.6±1.3 y vs. 13.4±1.4 y; P=0.05). Earlier menarche also significantly predicted injury status (Wald c2=7.43; Pb=-1.02±0.37; OR=0.36; 95% CI:0.17-0.75), but was not correlated with anterior knee laxity. Within injured athletes, however, laxity in the unaffected knee was significantly related to time since menarche (r2=0.79, Pr2=0.72, P"

Methods: The statistical sample of this research was 13 males with Pronated Feet (PF) (Mean±SD age: 26.2±2.8 y; height: 176.1±8.4 cm; weight: 78.3±14.3 kg). A force plate (Bertec, USA) with a sample rate of 1000 Hz was used to record the reaction forces under each foot. Three test conditions in our study included shod running with rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot patterns. Repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for analyzing the data. Results: During forefoot running, the research subjects attained 10% higher GRF values in vertical direction, compared with rearfoot running (P˂0.001, d=2.133). Forefoot running decreased the peak vertical GRF, compared to rearfoot running (by 12%, P=0.01, d=0.826). Barefoot running decreased the peak vertical GRF, compared to shod running (by 6%, P=0.027, d=1.143). The collected results revealed a significantly lower FyMed (P&lt;0.02, d=1.11, 14%), Fy99.5% (P&lt;0.02, d=0.11, 8%), and greater FyNe (P&lt;0.02, d=0.72, 10%), Fz99.5% (P&lt;0.01, d=4.30, 124%), and FzNe (P&lt;0.01, d=1.65, 44%) when running with rearfoot strike pattern, compared with forefoot strike pattern. Conclusion: The study subjects with pronated feet experienced greater GRF values during forefoot running than rearfoot; such data may imply an increased risk of running injuries. Therefore, forefoot running is not recommended for runners with pronated feet."

https://openalex.org/W3089584610,Fatigue-Related and Timescale-Dependent Changes in Individual Movement Patterns Identified Using Support Vector Machine,2020-09-30,2020,article,"The scientific and practical fields—especially high-performance sports—increasingly request a stronger focus be placed on individual athletes in human movement science research. Machine learning methods have shown efficacy in this context by identifying the unique movement patterns of individuals and distinguishing their intra-individual changes over time. The objective of this investigation is to analyze biomechanically described movement patterns during the fatigue-related accumulation process within a single training session of a high number of repeated executions of a ballistic sports movement—specifically, the frontal foot kick (mae-geri) in karate—in expert athletes. The two leading research questions presented for consideration are (1) Can characteristics of individual movement patterns be observed throughout the entire training session despite continuous changes, i.e., even as fatigue-related processes increase? and (2) How do intra-individual movement patterns change as fatigue-related processes increase throughout a training session? Sixteen expert karatekas performed 606 frontal foot kicks directed toward an imaginary target. The kicks were performed in nine sets at 80% (K-80) of the self-experienced maximal intensity. In addition, six kicks at maximal intensity (K-100) were performed after each of the nine sets. Between the sets, the participants took a 90-s break. Three-dimensional full-body kinematic data of all kicks were recorded with 10 infrared cameras. The normalized waveforms of nine upper- and lower-body joint angles were classified using a supervised machine learning method (support vector machine). The results of the classification revealed a disjunct distinction between the kinematic movement patterns of individual athletes. The identification of unique movement patterns of individual athletes was independent of the intensity and the degree of fatigue-related processes. In other words, even with the accumulation of fatigue-related processes, the unique movement patterns of an individual athlete can be clearly identified. During the training session, changes in intra-individual movement patterns could also be detected, indicating the occurrence of adaptations in individual movement patterns throughout the fatigue-related accumulation process. The results suggest that these adaptations can be modeled in terms of changes in patterns rather than increasing variance. Practical consequences are critically discussed."

As many methods are employed, it is important to know which they are currently available, which data on human body masses, lengths, center of mass (COM) location, weights and moment of inertia are available and which methods are most suitable for a specific research purposes. The present review examines the literature concerning human body segments properties for biomechanical purposes. It emerges that data obtained in studies on cadaveric specimens are still the most accurate, whilst technological tools currently available are manifolds, each one with proper advantages and disadvantages. Classical studies were focused mainly on white men, while in recent year the available data of body segments has been extended to children, woman, and other races.

Therefore, ligament reinforcement is needed to protect the knee joint and increase the stability of the joint. It plays a vital role in human activities. In this paper, a 3D-CT three-dimensional reconstruction method is used to reconstruct the ACL natural femoral imprint and double-bone tract. The relative positional relationship between the two center points is compared, and the law is summarized to guide the improvement of ACL anatomic double-beam reconstruction under arthroscopy. The 3D reconstruction results suggest that the bone layer in the anterior medial portion is the thickest, forming a peak, and the thickness of the bone layer in the posterior medial portion gradually decreases in a stepwise manner. The entire bone tissue in the anterior medial portion and posterior medial portion is integrated into one body. The tissues are connected as a whole, and the thickness is relatively uniform. The two parts of the bone tissues are not connected. The CF tissue was inserted into the bone tissue in a zigzag pattern. The changes of CF tissues in the anterior medial and posteromedial CF tissues were similar, and they were distributed stepwise from the inside to the outside. According to the bone and CF spatial structure and changing rules, ACL is divided into medial and lateral beams. According to this study, it can be summarized that (1) 3D reconstruction can clearly reconstruct the natural footprint of ACL femoral stops and postoperative osseous position and (2) 3D reconstruction can be used to evaluate the position of osseous postoperative ACL anatomic double-beam reconstruction. Arthroscopy double-beam reconstruction of ACL is instructive."

The anterior oblique portion of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the elbow is the primary static restraint to valgus stress during the overhead throwing motion. The main research question was if the ""Elbow Tester"" that we have developed was reliable and reproducible for further use in research and daily practice.Three different examiners tested both elbows of 11 volunteers for UCL laxity. Each elbow was tested 5 times using a standard 2 Nm valgus load, and 3 times using a manual maximum valgus load. One examiner tested the volunteers again 1 week later. The outcomes of elbow valgus laxity were compared between examiners. The intraobserver reliability was assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and interobserver reliability was also assessed with a mixed model repeated ANOVA test.The device demonstrated a high level of intraobserver reliability with both the 2 Nm valgus force and manual maximum valgus force, using a minimum of three trials as determined by an ICC > 0.9 for all examiners. The interobserver reliability was moderate using the 2 Nm valgus load with an ICC value of 0.72 and significant different outcomes of elbow valgus laxity amongst examiners (p < 0.01). A high interobserver reliability (ICC value of 0.90) was observed using manual maximum valgus force and no differences between outcomes (p > 0.53).The noninvasive valgus elbow tester demonstrates high interobserver and intraobserver reliability using manual maximum valgus force and can be used for further research and daily practice."

The RT training protocol will be delivered during tDCS and will comprise kicking a ball from a platform, placed on either the right or the left side, depending on a light cue, during a 10-min interval (between minute 5 and minute 15 after 20-min stimulation). Changes in choice RT in the upper and lower limbs will be considered primary outcome measures, and changes in Trail Making Test and Digit Span Test will be considered secondary outcome measures. Any adverse effects during the study period will be reported. To detect changes in continuous outcomes, a the anodal tDCS and the sham mode will be compared using a t-test for normal distribution, or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for non-normal distribution; changes will be considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. <bold>Discussion: </bold>The FAST trial is a new proposal that uses a novel method of evaluation and training of choice RT in soccer players through a functional task. The anodal tDCS along with choice RT training with a functional task can be an efficient tool for athletes to prevent injuries. Our findings may be useful for soccer athletes to have enhanced responses during a game, and to improve performances in championships. <bold>Trial Registration:</bold> Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (Rebec) - RBR-9bjttc<bold>Date of registration: </bold>02/28/2020<bold>Last Update: </bold>04/20/2020"

This research was aimed to determine the smartphone addiction status, physical activity levels and related factors of university students. Using convenience sampling, university students in Isparta/Turkey completed two questionnaires in Spring semester assessing smartphone addiction and physical activity levels. A total of 147 participants attended in this study. The participants included in the scope of the research; the questionnaire including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Smartphone Addiction Questionnaire, which were considered to be related to socio-demographic characteristics, smartphone use and physical activity habits were applied under direct observation. The physical activity for males was higher than females. There was a significant relationship between age and smart phone use. Whereas the age of the participants increased, a decrease in the number of smartphone usage was observed. The differences of between educational groups are related to the lower level of smartphone addiction of the graduate students compared to the associate degree students. Finally, there was no significant difference between the level of physical activity and the score of smartphone usage as the main aim of this study."

Although there is scant scientific evidence published to date, the association with risk factors such as internal diseases or steroid use is commonly described in various reports. Due to traumatic incidents or sporting overuse, partial or complete ruptures can occur. Clinically, stress-related posterior elbow pain, swelling, ecchymosis, loss of strength in extension, and a palpable gap in the tendon can be seen. Physical examination shows reduced extension force and increasing pain with forced extension against resistance. Tendinopathies and resulting partial or complete ruptures can be detected by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Conservative therapy with temporary immobilization is recommended for tendinopathies or minor ruptures of the triceps tendon. Complete ruptures or larger partial ruptures should be treated surgically with anatomical refixation of the tendon."

Recently, researchers have focused on using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain deformation in real time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, training such models requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head impacts, each consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a few modes, e.g., 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are predominantly low frequency since over 70% of the angular velocity response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40 Hz. We compared our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of kinematic-based metrics-such as head injury criterion (HIC), rotational injury criterion (RIC), and brain injury metric (BrIC)-and brain tissue deformation-based metrics-such as brain angle metric (BAM), maximum principal strain (MPS), and axonal fiber strains (FS). In all cases, our approach reproduced injury metrics similar to the ground truth measurements with no significant difference, whereas the existing methods obtained significantly different (p < 0.01) values as well as substantial differences in injury classification sensitivity and specificity. This emulator will enable us to provide the necessary data augmentation to build a head impact kinematic data set of any size. The emulator and corresponding examples are available on our website."

In response to these significant knowledge gaps, the US Department of Defense (DoD) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) partnered to form the NCAA-DoD Grand Alliance in 2014. The NCAA-DoD CARE Consortium was established with the aim of creating a national multi-site research network to study the clinical and neurobiological natural history of concussion in NCAA athletes and military service academy cadets and midshipmen. In addition to the data collected for the larger CARE Consortium effort, each service academy has pursued military specific lines of research relevant to operational and medical readiness associated with concussion. The purpose of this paper is to describe the structure of the NCAA-DoD Grand Alliance efforts at the service academies, as well as, discuss military specific research objectives and provide an overview of progress to date. A secondary objective is to discuss the challenges associated with conducting large-scale studies in the service academy environment and highlight future directions for concussion research endeavors across the CARE service academy sites."

Psychological readiness predicts successful return to sport, but it is unclear if psychological experiences differ between males and females during recovery. Objective To explore gender differences in psychological readiness factors of return to sport after ACLR. Design Qualitative study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 12 male (months since surgery = 6.2 ± 1.2) and 13 female (months since surgery = 6.4 ± 1.3) high school athletes with a history of ACLR. Data Collection and Analysis Participants were interviewed before physician clearance to return to activity. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using deductive thematic coding of 5 themes identified from previous research (psychological distress, self-efficacy, locus of control, athletic identity, and fear of reinjury) and inductive secondary subthematic coding. Gender comparisons were generated within primary themes and secondary subthemes. Results All deductive themes were consistently reinforced. Male and female participants reported fear of movement, loss of athletic identity, and motivational mindsets for return to sport and self-improvement. Males reported a stronger sense of internal locus of control using positive internal reinforcement, whereas females described balancing internal and external control and valuing external support systems. Male participants described mood changes influenced by physical and social limitations. Female participants closely monitored their emotions throughout recovery and were influenced by rehabilitation fluctuations. Conclusions Male and female high school athletes described different psychological factors related to return to sport and locus of control as well as psychological distress. Gender-specific psychological interventions may be warranted to overcome psychological barriers after ACLR."
https://openalex.org/W3088371042,Does the Relative Age Effect Influence Short-Term Performance and Sport Career in Team Sports? A Qualitative Systematic Review,2020-09-23,2020,review,"Background. The impact on athletes based on grouping methods according to the date of birth within the constituent year, known as the Relative Effect of Age - RAE, is a factor that can influence the achievement of sports success. Many studies have examined the magnitude of this phenomenon in sport; however, the relationship between the RAE and performance in team sports competition has not been accurately evaluated so far. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the influence of the RAE on competition performance in team sports through of analysis of published peer-reviewed articles from 2000 to 2019 Methods. According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis systematic search guidelines, 19 studies were identified of the 2093 that were found in the systematic searching process carried out in four databases: Sport Discus, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and Scopus. The sample of the study was composed by 77,329 players, of which 92.08% were male and 7.92% were female, while the recorded performance measurements were 87,556. The relation between relative age effects and competition performance was registered according to constraints-based theorical model: individual constraints (sample characteristics) and task constraints (sport context). Moreover, study quality analysis ""Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology"" was carried out. Results. The short-term individual (10.20%) and collective (18.09%) performance was influenced by the RAE while the long-term individual performance (49.71%) was affected by the RAE reverse. However, in 16.99% of the measurements, no relationship was found between the RAE and competition performance. In the analysis by subcategory, the influence of the RAE was higher in men, in adulthood (senior category), in invasion games and in national contexts Discussion. The findings clearly demonstrated that the RAE has a great influence on the performance in team sport. Possible implications for policy and practice should be discussed in order to prevent unequal practice based on biased models that prioritize the athlete's current performance and, therefore, obviate their maturational development. The heterogeneity and variability of the identified results require a relativization of the findings of this study."
https://openalex.org/W3090603114,Hip and thigh muscular activity in professional soccer players during an isometric squat with and without controlled hip contraction (Actividad muscular de cadera y muslo en jugadores de fútbol profesionales durante una sentadilla isométrica con y sin co,2020-09-23,2020,article,"The purpose of the present investigation was twofold 1) To compare the hip and thigh muscular activity of professional soccer players when performing the isometric squat with and without controlled hip contraction; 2) To determine the muscular relationships that take place during these methods of execution of the exercise. Methods: 11 healthy male professional soccer players, randomly performed three modalities of isometric squat at a 60° knee flexion: conventional squat (SQ), squat with hip abduction contraction (SQ-ABD) and squat with hip adduction contraction (SQ-ADD), controlled at 70% of 1 maximum repetition. The activity of the gluteus medius (GM), tensor fasciae latae (TFL), vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), semitendinosus (ST) and biceps femoris (BF) was obtained through surface electromyography. Hip (GM/TFL), quadriceps (VM/VL) hamstrings (ST/BF), and hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratios were analyzed. Results: GM increases in SQ-ABD and SQ-ADD compared to SQ (p&lt;.01). The TFL, VL, SM and BF muscles have significantly higher activity in SQ-ADD compared to SQ (p&lt;.05). The VL, VM and BF muscles significantly increase their activity in SQ-ADD compared to SQ-ABD (p &lt;0.05). GM/TFL, VM/VL and ST/BF do not show significant differences between the three isometric squat methods. The H/Q ratio was higher in SQ-ABD and SQ-ADD compared to SQ (p&lt;.01). Conclusion: The squat with hip adduction contraction in a controlled manner increases the muscular activity of the hip and thigh. Performing this combined maneuver can have benefits in sports training and rehabilitation because it increases the H/Q ratio of soccer players. Resumen.

https://openalex.org/W3087384234,A model for calculating the mechanical demands of overground running,2020-09-21,2020,article,"An energy-based approach to quantifying the mechanical demands of overground, constant velocity and/or intermittent running patterns is presented. Total mechanical work done (Wtotal) is determined from the sum of the four sub components: work done to accelerate the centre of mass horizontally (Whor), vertically (Wvert), to overcome air resistance (Wair) and to swing the limbs (Wlimbs). These components are determined from established relationships between running velocity and running kinematics; and the application of work-energy theorem. The model was applied to constant velocity running (2–9 m/s), a hard acceleration event and a hard deceleration event. The estimated Wtotal and each sub component were presented as mechanical demand (work per unit distance) and power (work per unit time), for each running pattern. The analyses demonstrate the model is able to produce estimates that: 1) are principally determined by the absolute running velocity and/or acceleration; and 2) can be attributed to different mechanical demands given the nature of the running bout. Notably, the proposed model is responsive to varied running patterns, producing data that are consistent with established human locomotion theory; demonstrating sound construct validity. Notwithstanding several assumptions, the model may be applied to quantify overground running demands on flat surfaces."

Sports such as volleyball are thought to cause movement assymetries due to specific sporting demands. Further, between limb comparisons are often used for return to sport decisions. Despite this, little information is available regarding the presence of assymetry in volleyball athletes. Therefore the purpose of this investigation was to determine the presence of assymetry in dorsiflexion range of motion (DFROM) and dynamic postural control variables, factors important in return to sport decisions, both the group and individual level in professional male volleyball players. Secondarly, we aimed to better understand the role of DFROM on the Star excursion balance test (SEBT), a measure of dynamic postural control. Method: Thirty-two Professional male volleyball players (age: 24.7±5.53 years, height: 190.6±7.63 cm., weight: 84.5±9.28 kg., BMI: 23.22±1.62 kg/m2) participated in this investigation. All participants reported for a single test session during which DFROM and the SEBT were assessed on both limbs. Results: There was a significant group difference (p <0.05) between limbs for the normalized anterior (landing leg: 73.3 ± 6.2%; non-landing leg: 71.4 ± 6.8% ) posteromedial (landing leg: 112.6±9.3%; non-landing leg: 107.6±10.8%) and posterolateral (landing leg: 114.5±8.1%; non-landing leg: 111.4±9.4%) SEBT reach direction. The anterior and posteriomedial but not the posteriolateral reach differences exceeded the minimal detectable change score for the SEBT. At the individual level, the vast majority of participants demonstrated minimal assymetry. Significant correlations were found between DFROM and the anterior SEBT reach (r = 0.36 to 0.39, p<0.04) as well as the posteriolateral SEBT reach (r= 0.47 to 0.50, p<0.01). Conclusions: Professional volleyball players do not have DFROM or dynamic postural control assymetries but DFROM can influence dynamic postural control."

Conclusion: The technique of oval forceps assisted with small incision for minimally invasive treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture is a safe, reliable, and have an extremely low complication rate. Furthermore, this technique is easy to learn, utilizes simple instruments, and is cost-effective, making this technique an attractive alternative to traditional techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3168001588,The biomechanical changes during sport-specific tasks and different commercially available footwear in individuals following meniscectomy,2020-09-20,2020,dissertation,"Injuries to the meniscus are common particularly in sporting individuals. Traumatic meniscal tears typically occur due to a high impact twisting action on a planted foot, which can be seen in sports such as basketball, football and skiing. Competitive athletes generally agree to having a meniscectomy surgery with the objective of returning to the same level of activity as was considered normal before the injury, however the effect of returning to sport and performing sport-specific tasks has not been researched in depth following meniscectomy. Altered knee mechanics and increased knee loading, like those seen in knee osteoarthritis (OA), have been observed following a meniscectomy, therefore identifying ways to reduce knee loading and slow the progression of OA are a priority. Individuals following meniscectomy have been reported to be 15 times more likely to develop knee OA compared to the general healthy population. Whilst it is well researched that medial partial meniscectomies result in the onset of medial (OA), little is known about the biomechanical effects following lateral meniscectomy in comparison to individuals following medial meniscectomy. Therefore, an improved understanding of biomechanical changes following medial and lateral meniscectomy, specifically during both functional and sport-specific tasks is vital and whether approaches such as the use of different footwear have an influence to aid in offloading the knee. 

To develop a robust and reliable test protocol for the investigation of the biomechanical outcomes in individuals following meniscectomy, a repeatability study was performed, which enabled the development of a protocol that was applied in the following studies of the thesis. The BOOM study investigated biomechanical and clinical outcomes following meniscectomy surgery in 29 individuals following both medial and lateral meniscectomy in comparison to 20 healthy controls. It was found that there were few differences when comparing individuals following medial and lateral meniscectomy, therefore the sub-groups were combined to analyse the knee joint loading. Knee loading was increased in the early stages of rehabilitation during walking, running and landing, highlighting initial effects of non-effective rehabilitation with muscle weakness, stiffness in joint motion and kinesiophobia, which may have the potential to lead on to knee joint degeneration.

Lastly, the Meni-Foot study looked at the use of three different types of footwear including cushioning footwear, stability footwear and lateral wedge footwear in comparison to neutral footwear, to find a way to offload the affected compartment of the knee and slow the risk of OA progression, specifically in a young active population. Lateral wedge footwear was found to offload the medial compartment of the knee and aid individuals following medial meniscectomy, however further research needs to be done looking at a more comfortable shoe with a lateral wedge to offload the medial compartment and a greater medial arch support to offload the lateral compartment whilst considering pain and motion during dynamic tasks.

To summarise the findings in this thesis, other than greater trunk lean in the lateral meniscectomy during walking, there were no significant differences in knee loading between individuals following a medial meniscectomy and individuals following a lateral meniscectomy. The lack of differences in knee loading between medial and lateral meniscectomy groups was unexpected, however it suggested combining groups in the short-term period following surgery was applicable. Individuals on average 6 months post-meniscectomy showed reduced balance, isometric strength and self-reported function. Individuals showed a quadriceps avoidance strategy, with altered muscle activation, stiffer movement patterns and greater kinesiophobia compared to healthy controls. Non-invasive interventions such as lateral wedge footwear can be used to offload the medial compartment of the knee during walking and therefore, could be beneficial for individuals following medial meniscectomy. Further research needs to be done on sport specific tasks and different footwear conditions depending on which compartment of the knee it aims to offload."

A total of 240 workouts in 15 elite athletes were analyzed over two years. Physiological and kinematic data were gathered with the wireless Bioharness system along with capillary blood samples for lactate concentration. Progressive exercise tests until exhaustion were periodically performed to obtain reference data. The rule changes resulted in significant increases (mainly medium or large effects) in the physiological (2.9–14.4%) and kinematic (4.8–10.1%) response to taekwondo-specific workouts. The largest increases were for peak breathing rate (12.0%), energy expenditure (6.6%), blood lactate immediately after exercise (10.2%) and at the 30th min of recovery (14.4%), and peak kinematic activity (10.1%). Significant differences between taekwondo-specific workouts and tournament combats persisted after the shift from old to new rules, ranging from 2.4 to 38.5% for physiological and from 2.9 to 15.5% for kinematic variables. The largest workout–combat differences were revealed for post-exercise (15.9%) and recovery (38.5%) blood lactate, peak (−15.8%) and relative (−15.0%) breathing rate, and mechanical (13.5%) and physiological (14.2%) intensity. Our study suggests that the rule amendments significantly modify the exercise response to discipline-specific workouts and that taekwondo-specific training sessions do not fully recreate the tournament demands in terms of physiological and kinematic load."

https://openalex.org/W4246967933,Traditional and contemporary approaches to mathematical fitness-fatigue models in exercise science: A practical guide with resources. Part I.,2020-09-17,2020,preprint,"The standard fitness-fatigue model (FFM) was developed more than 40 years ago and remains a prominent conceptual model within exercise science. Translation from a conceptual form into a mathematical structure reveals a collection of models (FFMs) with common properties linking training inputs to performance outcomes. The greatest potential use of FFMs is to predict future performance of athletes with sufficient accuracy to assist with training program design and planning key tapering periods. However, despite a long history and consistent study, there has been limited uptake in practice. This is most likely due to a lack of accessible resources explaining key concepts and processes required to fit models, and uncertainty regarding overall predictive validity. Part I of this review series provides a comprehensive overview of FFMs and discusses three key aspects of fitting models including: 1) training load quantification; 2) criterion performance selection; and 3) parameter estimation. As the majority of athletes engage in sports where performance is complex and determined by a range of physical, psychological and technical factors, it is argued that FFMs may be best placed to quantify components of fitness (e.g., strength, power) targeted by an athlete’s training, rather than competitive outcomes. Additionally, contemporary approaches to training monitoring (e.g., measurement of barbell velocity and repetitions in reserve) are recommended as tools to generate high frequency “performance” measures to better fit FFMs. Essential further developments require collaboration between researchers and practitioners with larger data sets to establish conditions where accurate predictions to future training could be obtained. A set of code-based resources in the R programming language are included with the review series to assist in fitting and evaluating models, and to enhance understanding of concepts described."

The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the association between physical fitness attributes and sports injury in female, team ball sport players. Methods Four scientific databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus) and reference lists of relevant research were searched for eligible studies up to September 2, 2019. Full-text articles examining the relationship between physical fitness and sports injury in female, team ball sport players were included. A modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess methodological quality. Data synthesis determined summary conclusions based on the number of significant relationships divided by the total relationships investigated and reported as a percentage. Level of certainty was identified for summary conclusions based on level of evidence. Sub-analyses regarding competition level, age, and single injury types were also conducted. Results A total of 44 studies were included. Data synthesis revealed no associations (low to moderate certainty) between body composition (1/9; 11%), flexibility (18–20%), and balance (2/8; 25%) and ‘any injury’ classification. No associations (mostly of moderate certainty) were found between flexibility (0–27%), muscular strength (0–27%), and body composition (14–33%) and various body region injury classifications, whereas mixed summary conclusions were shown for balance (0-48%). Many associations between physical fitness and sports injury were deemed ‘unknown’ or with an insufficient level of certainty. Sub-analyses revealed no association between strength and noncontact ACL injuries (0/5; 0%) or ankle sprains (0/12; 0%), and between flexibility and ankle sprains (1/5; 20%); however, insufficient certainty of these results exists. Clear associations were concluded between balance and lower body injuries in female, non-elite (10/16; 63%) and junior (9/12; 75%) team ball sport players, with moderate and insufficient certainty of these results, respectively. Conclusion Limited evidence is available to demonstrate relationships between physical fitness and sports injury in female, team ball sport players. High-quality evidence investigating the multifactorial nature of sports injury, including the interactions physical fitness qualities have with other injury determinants, is needed to better understand the role of physical fitness in minimising sports injuries in female, team ball sport players.

For the reliability study, twelve (n = 6 female) post-pubertal adolescent distance runners performed an isometric quarter-squat on a dual force plate and unilateral isometric hip extension and hip abduction tests on two occasions. For the correlation study, participants (n = 31) performed the strength tests plus a submaximal incremental running assessment and a maximal running test. Running economy was expressed as the average energy cost of running for all speeds below lactate turnpoint and was scaled for body mass using a previously calculated power exponent. Allometrically scaled peak force during the quarter-squat and peak torque in the hip strength tasks showed acceptable levels of reproducibility (typical error ≤6.3%). Relationships between strength asymmetry and performance and RE were low or negligible (r < 0.47, p > 0.05), except for hip abduction strength asymmetry and RE in the female participants (r = 0.85, p < 0.001, n = 16). Practitioners should consider inter-limb hip abduction strength asymmetry on an individual level, and attempting to reduce this asymmetry in females may positively impact RE."

Resultsshow that there are some changes in attitudes and future planned activities after participation inthese projects, similar to those seen in hands-on service-learning environments. In addition,comparisons of students on non-service focused projects to those on actual service-learning orservice-oriented projects show they are significantly less affected in terms of concern for socialproblems or that non-profit work is a true venue for engineering work.Introduction and Background LiteratureService Learning and Service-Oriented Projects. Service learning as defined by the NationalService Learning Clearinghouse15 is “a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningfulcommunity service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civicresponsibility, and strengthen communities.” Building from this definition, we can identifyspecific elements of service learning which are identified in the book Service Learning:Engineering in your Community9 as possessing the following elements related to engineering: • Service: Service to an underserved area or people. This can be direct, and ongoing, or project-based, involve hands-on aspects or research and analysis. • Academic Content: A means to learn engineering principles more effectively, the service is linked to the course content and study requirements. • Partnerships and Reciprocity: involving students, faculty, the community and possibly companies, and when done well, all partners contribute to the work, receive benefits from the work and learn from the work. • Mutual Learning: Based on mutual respect, students learn from expertise and knowledge in the community partners, as the partners can learn about engineering and technology. Deeper levels of learning can be gained as they work together and impact each other. • Analysis and Reflection: This is a key component and vital to connecting the service to the academic content, in order to really gain the most benefit. This extends from relating the academic content to the service, the implications of the social context of the work, all the way to seeing the role of engineering in society.The learning benefits are also discussed in the book by Lima. “The connection to the communitycan provide motivation and a context. These have been cited as critical learning components bycognitive scientists who study how people learn.” 9 Learners are motivated by being able to seethe problems more clearly and the impact they may have as they solve these problems. Inaddition, many of the desired attributes of an engineer are developed through service-learningprojects, and many ABET outcomes can be mapped to results and tasks in these projects. Butmany of these same benefits are accomplished when students are involved in service-orientedprojects, even if these are not direct or experiential service-learning projects.As engineering educators, it is important to not only teach theory to our students but to alsopromote the notion that engineering provides an avenue to help others. We would like to developa sense of caring in our students and foster the idea that as engineers they have a real opportunityto make a difference in the lives of others. With these goals in mind, we often jump into theprocess of trying to integrate service-learning projects into a classroom only to realize later thatthe extra coordination and logistics required are extensive. In contrast to service learning, aservice-oriented project will possess virtually all of the same elements but without the need toactually interact with the community thus eliminating most of the challenges of coordination.Service Projects at Engineering Universities. In recent years, many have attempted to integrateprojects with the hopes of improving their class quality, student experiences, and retention rates.Large-scale programs have been set up such as the ROXIE project at Virginia Tech which pairedupwards of 87 community partners with 185 first-year design teams.10 Purdue Universityinstituted its EPICS program “Engineering Projects in Community Service” with 400 studentsforming 25 multidisciplinary teams.3 Colorado School of Mines also has an EPICS program,originally based on Purdue’s initiative.25 Cal Poly Pomona established an Engineering ServiceLearning Institute (ESLI) with NSF support to integrate service learning in the engineeringcurriculum and developed service projects such as a Voice Controlled Wheelchair and Devicesfor Developmentally Disabled.13 Faculty at the University of Michigan using several statisticaltests such as ANOVA, stepwise and multiple regression analysis showed that the overallresponse of students participating in a service-learning semester was significantly higher thanprevious non-service-learning semesters, indicating a higher sense of satisfaction with the courseand instructor.11 In a first-year hands-on engineering design class at the University of Coloradothey studied the effects of incorporating service learning into the class on first-to-second yearretention.16 Participation in this class appears to be improving year one to year two retention,although the authors state they were unable to see any clear statistical difference for the service-learning sections vs. total class data.In a discussion of student attitudes surrounding service learning and how projects may influencethese attitudes, it is interesting to see how different engineering schools present service-learningopportunities to their students and to see if they are at all tailored to engineering and to first-yearprograms. To gain insight into practices at major U.S. schools, a survey of school websites wasconducted, searching primarily for ‘service learning’ and then attempting to see what was beingdone and where. To narrow the list of survey schools, the survey was limited to programs offeredat the so-called ‘top’ engineering Universities. One arbiter of ‘top’ schools is the annual list fromU.S. News and World Report magazine of the Best Colleges in Engineering. The 2011 listconsists of MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Cal Tech, Georgia Tech, University of Illinois,University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, and Purdue University.23Of these ten, it appears that only Purdue has a formal program as mention previously, EPICS,aimed at involving first year engineering students in service-learning projects.18 Some 400students over 20 departments working in 25 teams participated in projects during the 2004academic year. To date, approximately 2000 students have had experiential learning through thePurdue program.The balance of the nine other schools has a variety of other methods and means to exposestudents to world service issues. It does not appear that any school has a targeted approach solelyfor first-year students. Nor do all the schools have organizations or service-learning coursesstrictly aimed at engineering education, at least not that were clear from their web sites. As manyof the schools are diverse university communities, the courses and projects tend bemultidisciplinary and non-engineering based. The methods at these schools range from specificstand-alone courses14,21 to schools that have designated ‘centers’ for service-based work.2,6,8,19,22The centers appear to be separate institutional organizations, often funded by major outsidedonors, that have permanent staff often interacting with community-based non-profit groups toeffect change. Students are then added to projects and are able to participate and learn throughthese community outreach endeavors.Half of the schools researched have alliances with non-profit organizations, although the schoolsdo not all have dedicated ‘centers’ as part of the overarching infrastructure. MIT started its ownnon-profit group as an outgrowth of an earlier set of course projects which grew into a sustainedexternal effort.14 Others have outreach into local existing groups and have partnered withthem.2,5,6,8 Cal Tech has an engineering-based course that has focused entirely on a community inGuatemala and is annually working on incremental community improvements in that dedicatedlocale.17The overview above indicates that the top ten schools are all engaged in service learning withvarying degrees of infrastructure and breadth. However, it appears that engagement of first-yearengineering students is not a focus of the greater majority of these programs.First-year Service Projects. Project selection in a first-year engineering design course is criticalto a successful outcome. Lund and Budny point out that a fundamental challenge in developing afulfilling and rewarding experience for each student is the identification of appropriatecommunity partners and projects.12 They note that their freshmen engineering students, with alimited skill set, have a tendency to select projects which are clearly marked as engineering-related, often resulting in unattainable goals leading to unhappy community partners anddiscouraged students.The fit for service or humanitarian-type projects and first-year engineering design courses hasbeen outlined and discussed in many places, including the text on engineering service learningauthored by Lima.9 One chapter in this textbook maps the engineering design method for servicelearning. The method outlined matches other design processes, with steps of problemidentification, developing specifications, concepts, details, implementation, and reflection andredesign; these match the design process used in our own first-year engineering design course.The project profiles also align with the projects we offer the students defined as service andhumanitarian projects. For example, the list of projects from the book and other literatureinclude environmental projects, along with other topics such as playgrounds, hospitals or clinicprojects, agricultural machinery and equipment for the disabled. The projects offered in ourcourse can be organized into similar categories; there are health-related projects, equipment forthird world countries such as water heaters, or stoves, emergency relief equipment, devices forchild safety, environmental projects such as river cleanup, and alternative power generation, andaids for disabled and handicapped such as mass transit access and vehicle assist devices. Theservice to humanity is clearly defined in all with only the major difference being the directcontact with the community they are serving (See Appendix C for complete list).In the College of Engineering at Northeastern University, the integration of service-learningprojects in a first-year Introduction to Engineering Design course has been under considerationfor a number of years. But with 500+ first-year students, the management and administration ofservice-learning projects seemed daunting in the absence of significant resources provided tosupport the effort. In order to be implemented, the first-year faculty would have to coordinateand develop upwards of 160 projects that would involve many community partners. To assessthe merits of such an undertaking, it was decided to first develop projects with a theme of havinga societal benefit; these would be design project topics with humanitarian and service focus,projects that have an impact in their local community, or even a further global impact.Some History of the Involved Course. More than ten years ago, as the first-year EngineeringDesign course was being developed and improved, the major design project continued to be akey element. This project was begun around 7 weeks into the semester, and projects chosen bythe majority of student groups were mostly product design based. The students followed thedesign process in teams, and designed on paper a product or process, with a final report andpresentation at the end of the semester. Example projects –which were primarily studentselected– were safety devices, improvements on products, sports devices, new products thestudents were interested in, or products that the students selected for personal interest or help.There were safety ladders, pet feeders, soccer ball returns, storage systems for dorm rooms,classroom redesign, and new alarm clocks.The instructors of the design course began to consider projects with more impact and that have alarger scope. They developed a list of humanitarian and service-based projects which has grownand been developed over the years. A current version is included in the Appendix C. The projectswere now all focused on helping others, either here in their own community or globally, such asimproving water conservation in agriculture, disaster relief, products for the disabled orhandicapped, environmental, green, or conservation projects, and child or personal safetyproducts. Students selected a project in teams from an instructor-provided list. Some classesworked on one topic only while others would have two groups working on the same topic oreven having many groups work on several different topics. The students seemed to be asenthusiastic about these projects as those previously self-selected and the project quality was ashigh as before, if not higher, as assessed by the instructors. The instructors saw better research,better development of alternatives and many well-designed solutions. It was time to assess theeffects that these projects have on our students.Motivation and Survey MethodAs noted, the literature and 10 to 15 years of practice at many universities have clearlydemonstrated that service learning provides benefits to both the community and the students’learning with increased levels of social responsibility.1,4,7,20 As stated in the reasons above,before committing to developing a service-learning program, it was decided to pilot theintegration of service-oriented projects first. The question, then, is do these projects affect thestudents’ in a ways similar to those of service learning? After working on these service-orientedprojects, do the students have a changed perspective on engineering that includes helping andserving others? To answer these questions, a pre- and post- project survey was given to all first-year engineering students to assess whether their focus had been impacted as a result of workingon and seeing presentations of engineering design in service-oriented projects.The dual-phase survey was entitled ‘Engineering in Society’, and was administered to more than500 first-year students in all Engineering Design classes. The pre-survey was given early in thesemester before the design projects were started (Appendix A). The first part of the pre-surveyassessed their familiarity with current events locally and globally, and the sources of theirinformation, along with basic demographics and selected majors in engineering. This wasfollowed by a series of questions on students’ knowledge of human needs, organizations, andservices. The bulk of the survey focused on identifying engineering roles such as: engineersproduce products, engineers help improve lives, design systems, work for non-profitorganizations. The post survey was given during the last week of classes after completion of thedesign project and was developed to measure the student’s changes in perceptions of engineeringin part on the basis of the project spectrum (Appendix B). Responses and statements that wereevaluated can be seen in the tables to follow.Survey Data and Analysis: Pre- and Post-Survey ResultsThe first step taken was a pre- and post-assessment in most sections of the course. Students weregiven a survey early in the semester (Appendix A) that focused on their perception of engineersin society and familiarity of human service organizations (n=512). The second survey (AppendixB) was given at the end of the course, with similar questions to reveal whether there had beenany shift in attitude (n=436). Here are selected results and discussion:Table 1. Familiarity with the following human services areas, 1=not familiar 5=very familiar Human services Before After Statistically significant? Housing Aid 2.27 2.63 Yes, p s disappearances are not noted immediately. Design a way to ensure that children cannot be missed. (31) Individual Entertainment System for Hospitalized Children The Problem: Many young patients stricken with childhood diseases must remain in isolation with little social contact amongst their peers and have no access to entertainment during this difficult time. The patients are required to spend many days in the hospital undergoing treatment. This project is to design a system that will furnish not only entertainment and educational stimulus for individual patients, but also will provide the essential social interactions that may help young patients stay connected to others as they recover. (32) Child Front Seat Safety Measures In automobiles, many states do not require a children’s booster seat for passengers older than 5 years old or grater than 60 lbs, although pediatricians and other safety experts recommend minimums of 9 years of age and 90 lbs. Your groups’ task is to design a means to protect a child who sits in the front seat of an automobile. The design should accommodate a young child (or a small adult) who is greater than 5 years of age and weighs more that 60 lbs. Other Problems (33) Clean and Green Restroom Routine The Problem: Many public restrooms are adopting an even more health‐conscious approach for their users to avoid contact‐related diseases infections, and germs. This involves equipment and fixtures that facilitate clean routines in the lavatory areas. Practices to this effect involve water flow, soap dispensing, hand‐washing, hand drying, disposing of paper towels or tissues (in some cases), and contacting surfaces in the facility. Considering the ergonomics, movement of people, sanitation, customized and special needs, design a facility and its fixtures to address all these needs. While many parts exist to solve these problems, think about the smoothest flow and least amount of inconvenience, dripping, waste, mess, and contamination to generate a state‐of‐the art system to be installed that takes the facility engineering to a new level and considers the effectiveness and efficiency of the task, within a realistic budget. Your mission is delimited to the washing areas for a restroom that has 8 sinks in a space of about 80 Square feet with provisions for 2 ADA‐compliant width doorways. (ADA – Americans with Disabilities Act) (34) Portis Family House Playground Design A small house in the Boston Area houses 7 families that have been reunited during recovery of a parent from drug or alcohol abuse. In the yard of the housing area they have a small playground that is unsafe and needs to be redesigned. The area is small and sloped with existing cement walkways, plus a number of existing obstructions and challenges. It is also used for cookouts, outdoor meetings and gatherings. There is a very small budget for the project. Problem Statement: Design a playground/outdoor play area for Portis house families. The users will be children ages 1‐18. Pictures and dimensions of the existing area provided. (35) Device for Preventing Voice Damage Teachers, public speakers, singers, and other people who use their voices extensively and for a living often damage their voices and vocal cords over time and if not managed carefully. This occurs for many reasons, but one is speaking louder than necessary. Many times a speaker is using too much volume for the room. Other problems are pitch, quality of tone, where the voice is being produced and amount of breath being used. When vocal cords are damaged or being damaged, they also lose a smoothness of sound, that rough, scratchy forced sound replaces a smooth tone. A speaker could benefit from a wearable device that provides feedback about the current state of the voice; volume, tone, pitch, other – to help them change their vocal use before more damage occurs. Design a (possibly wearable) device that provides a voice professional (speaker, teacher, singer) with feedback on vocal quality to prevent vocal cord damage. (36) Engineered Methods to Expand Capabilities of Service Dogs The Problem: Service Dogs are trained to assist disabled individuals in order to help make them more independent in their homes and in society. These loving and intelligent creatures are trained extensively and have succeeded in serving as valuable attendants to their human companions. Many are able to open doors, retrieve items, and carry out a variety of other tasks such as leading their companions to the nearest empty seat, alerting their companions in urgent situations, etc. Conduct in‐depth associated research to propose, design, and develop a variety of engineered devices and adaptations that expand the capabilities of service dogs in terms enhancing the quality of life for their human companions in conducting activities of daily living inside and outside the home."

Most frequently, they are located in the midportion and insertional area. These entities result from different pathologic pathways, and different treatment strategies are applied. The outcome is rarely investigated. Methods This study includes patients who underwent surgery for partial tears in the midportion or retrocalcaneal Achilles tendon area between the years 2009 and 2015 by a single surgeon. Patients were prospectively assessed preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, using the VISA-A-G questionnaire. The final retrospective follow-up was performed after a minimum of 3.5 years postoperatively. Forty-eight Achilles tendon partial tears at the level of the retrocalcaneal bursa (impingement lesions) and 27 midportion Achilles tendon partial tears were identified. After applying rigorous exclusion criteria, 21 and 16 cases, respectively, remained for the final follow-up. Results were analysed by inferential and descriptive statistics. Results The VISA-A-G outcome scores improved significantly from preoperative to 6 months, 12 months, and final postoperative assessment. Preoperatively, the average VISA-A-G score was 42.1 (range, 18–73) for patients operated for Achilles tendon partial tears at the level of the retrocalcaneal bursa and 44.6 (range, 10–73) for the midportion Achilles tendon partial tear group, respectively. At final follow-up 88.8 (range, 15 to 100) and 96.9 (range, 71 to 100) were scored in the respective treatment groups. A repeated measures ANOVA determined that mean performance levels showed a statistically significant difference between measurements ( p &lt; 0.001). There was no systematic effect found between groups ( p = 0.836). Conclusions In Achilles tendon partial tears recalcitrant to conservative treatment, operative intervention is highly successful in most cases, irrespective of the level of the injury. Results were statistically equal when comparing the midportion and retrocalcaneal Achilles tendon partial tear groups. Trial registration DRKS, DRKS00014266.

https://openalex.org/W2924218998,Using Capstone Projects for Community Outreach,2020-09-10,2020,article,"Abstract The Capstone Projects course is certainly one of the most important courses the students experience in our college. In the Mechanical Engineering Department and in the Engineering Technology Department, students are exposed to and demonstrate their abilities listed in most, if not all, ABET student outcomes a-k. Still, in our experience, not all projects provide strong components related to student outcomes h (broad education), j (knowledge of contemporary issues), and especially i (life-long learning). In this context, this work shows some of our experiences in implementing projects originating from the community where our university is located. In particular, this work presents two cases: (i) one project based on the idea proposed by a local inventor related to power production and (ii) one project to satisfy the need of an elderly resident to move larger items with his pick-up truck. In both cases the clients have no engineering background, but they are confronted with problems that can be solved through engineering design. As opposed to other projects, such as related to people with physical disabilities or projects with the local industrial partners, in these cases the clients were very involved in the design process, although not as engineers. By working on such projects, our students were able to interact with and learn from people of different backgrounds; this interaction, while not always easy, benefitted both our students and our clients. They were also able to see firsthand the positive impact their work can have on people’s lives: transforming a dreamed idea into a physical prototype, and helping a community member with his activity. Finally, by directly interacting with people who continue to propose new ideas and have active lives, with new problems, even after retirement, our students experienced the importance of life-long learning and intellectual curiosity have on people’s lives. Our experience has been largely positive and we plan to expand our capstone project list to include more such projects."

This paper will discuss the adaptations from the original projects to a one-semestercourse and to various outreach activities.Students enrolled at our university who are pre-calculus ready follow a three-course sequencethrough the first-year engineering program (COURSE numbers). As part of the ______ project,design modules were created in biomechanics, wind, and aquaculture for these courses (~200students). For the biomechanics module, students designed, built, and analyzed a prosthetic leg.They used a force plate to record the forces generated from a simple kicking motion. Students inthe wind turbine module built and analyzed a lab-scale wind turbine constructed from recycledmaterials for their first course and used 3-D modeling software to design turbine blades for asecond semester project. These blades were printed on a 3-D printer and attached to an existingstand for a performance analysis. In the aquaculture project, students designed, built, andanalyzed a small-scale aerator for an aquaculture facility in their first semester. In the secondsemester, students developed the layout of the facility and evaluated the current pumping system.Results from the initial implementation in the 2010-2011 academic year indicated that themajority of students recognized the engineering applications of these projects and enjoyed thebuilding and analysis components. All teams felt that they would like to see more of this type ofproject in their first-year engineering courses. The success of these projects motivated first-yearinstructors in the two-course, calculus-ready sequence (COURSE numbers) to implementportions of the projects. In August 2011, the co-PIs from the PROJECT hosted a workshop for the faculty and instructorsin the first-year engineering department. The workshop covered the aquaculture and wind turbineprojects from the pre-calculus courses and provided implementation recommendations for thecalculus sequence. The wind energy project was selected for implementation into the calculus-ready sequence. The general deliverables for the pre-calculus and calculus courses are listedbelow in Table 1. Most of the necessary adaptations involved integrating and combining thedesign activities from the two-course sequence into a single course. The original design projects,the integration aspects and challenge, and recommendations for further integration will bediscussed in the paper.For 9 of the 13 calculus –ready courses, instructors used the first four deliverables from theCourse 1 wind turbine project and the ethics analysis. The testing and analysis component of theproject was taken from the Course 2 project. During the testing of the wind turbine, a motiondetector recorded the blade position. The data set was filtered and analyzed using MATLAB.Table 1.

Final Report MemoThe wind energy and biomechanics projects greatly interested the University Outreach Office.The design and construction aspects of the two projects were used in summer outreach programsthat targeted underrepresented groups in engineering. Students in these programs had only tenhours to construct and analyze their designs. As such, modifications of the construction andtesting procedures were used from pre-calculus Course 1.During the summer outreach programs, middle and high school students constructed an artificiallimb using PVC piping for the “bones” and a knee joint using a variety of materials (hinges,paint rollers, etc.). Their designs were tested using a two-step method. The first test was to verifythat their design had the correct range of motion. They compared measurements from their ownlegs to the design using a goniometer. The next step was to determine the force exerted during akick as measured on a force plate and also using a soccer ball.Students building wind turbines had to create blades for an existing hub and stand. The bladeswere constructed from different materials (plastic bottles, paper maché, cardboard, etc.). Oncethe blades were installed, the students tested them using a photo tachometer to record RPMs anda multimeter to determine how much voltage was generated. The following paper will describethe projects, and include an assessment of the implementation process."

We have found great success with “Modeling and Design” an innovative, required freshman course which engages our students as biomedical engineers from their first day on campus. Small groups, guided by upperclassmen lab managers, teaching assistants, and faculty, work through five modules including modeling human efficiency, the arm, and the cardiovascular system, as well as a foam core design project. By the conclusion of the fifth module, an independent modeling project, 96% of the students appreciate the value of working in teams to tackle complex challenges. They have become adept at using cooperative learning to develop and test their hypotheses, and to present their results through written lab reports and oral presentations. By the end of the semester, 84% of freshmen “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that the course had met its goal of providing a solid introduction to modeling physiological systems, academic and career mentoring, exposure to research and design opportunities available at XX University, and a concrete basis for a career choice in BME. More importantly, the course helps set up our students for long-term academic success, as indicated by a 94% freshmen/sophomore retention rate. Developing a mathematical model to describe a physiological system is a new concept for freshmen. For each project, the freshmen are provided with a one page background summary with just enough information to get started. Experimental testing of the mathematical model is an essential component of the learning process, and allows the students to collect data and perform a statistical analysis of their model. At first, the process of making assumptions, writing equations, developing an experimental protocol to test the model, and analyzing the results is daunting. By the final independent project, 88% of students felt exploring their own topic was an “excellent” or “good” learning experience and enjoyed presenting their results at a final poster session. Not only do the freshmen benefit from the course, but the upperclassmen lab managers believe they have gained valuable leadership and professional skills, such as providing constructive feedback and public speaking."

https://openalex.org/W4256632155,Panel Discussion: Understanding Students’ Narratives of Grand Challenges Scholars Program as a Nexus between Liberal and STEM Education,2020-09-10,2020,article,"Abstract In 2008, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), in collaboration with leading international technological scholars, produced a report with a radically new vision for engineering in the 21st century. Calling for “continuation of life on the planet, making our world more sustainable, secure, healthy, and joyful,” this document inspired a global movement urging interdisciplinary thinkers, policymakers, and the general public around the world to come together to address challenges facing humanity. As a part of this global movement, academic institutions responded by creating a Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP), an initiative that complements and extends engineering education to include knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to solve grand challenges outlined in NAE’s report. The GCSP is a framework that defines five competencies (Talent, Multicultural, Multidisciplinary, Entrepreneurship, and Social Consciousness), development of which serves to prepare a student to address NAE’s Grand Challenges. These five competencies necessitate a holistic approach to educating next generation global citizens, not just next generation engineers. As the program continues to grow, increasing numbers of scholars delve into the questions pertaining to the effectiveness of GCSP on improving students’ learning outcomes. However, not much is yet known about the ways in which students, both engineering and non-engineering, make sense of the ways in which GCSP supports their holistic growth and development into global citizens of tomorrow. Through this panel discussion and paper, we bring together GCSP Scholars from four different institutions funded by the Teagle Foundation to explicitly bridge liberal arts and STEM education through GCSP. The participating institutions - Olin College of Engineering (Olin), Lawrence Technological University (LTU), Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) - represent diverse academic and institutional cultures and are at different stages of GCSP development, with Olin being one of the founding GCSP schools and LTU being the newest addition to the national program. The panelists, both engineering and non-engineering majors as well as those early in their GCSP career and GCSP alumni, share their stories and critically reflect on the pathways which GCSP presented for them. Through their critical narratives, we show how the explicit bridging between liberal arts and STEM education within the four GCSPs enables Scholars to interrogate their personal selves and lead the way in engineering education by engaging in the hard work of thinking about what it means to be human."

With awareness of student interest as well as research interests in sensor data analysis in collegiate and professional athletics, authors seek to connect engineering students with their data analytics and/or sports interests by establishing internship opportunities with the on-campus athletics program. In Fall 2017, eleven industrial engineering undergraduate students who are considering careers in athletics data analytics or general data analysis fields participated in a pilot internship program with a variety of athletics programs on campus. Following an encouraging pilot phase (based on informal interviews/testimonials), we now work to establish a formal research and assessment plan for the internship program Via surveys and interviews with student participants as well as participants' supervisors (i.e., athletic coaches/assistants), we seek to investigate the components of the internship and explore how the experience impacts students career interests and self-efficacy related to pursuing a career in data analysis in particular as it relates to sports programs. We introduce the partners, provide an overview of the anticipated research and assessment plan, and discuss preliminary lessons from the program development and implementation. We anticipate that our findings will ignite discussion of how engineering departments can proactively reach beyond industry partners and explore on campus experiential opportunities for students."

This study utilized a quasi-experimental design in which comparisons were made between an upper-extremity plyometric group and a comparison group. 12 players were randomly recruited from two select level teams (12-15 each team) as a sample of convenience. Of those 12 players, 6 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and the other 6 were assigned to a comparison group. The experimental group participated in a supervised upper-extremity plyometric strength training program two times per week for 6 weeks, as well as a parent supervised home exercise program to be performed at home once per week. The comparison group completed their usual practice routine. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 16.0; Inc., Chicago IL). And independent t-test, a Mann-Whitney test, and two Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were utilized to attempt to identify within, and between, group differences for the variables that were studied. After 6 weeks of training, the experimental group experienced an increase of 2.44 mph in throwing velocity which yielded statistically significant results when compared to the comparison group’s increase of 0.59 mph which was not statistically significant. The researchers, nonetheless, concluded that exercises using biomechanical principles identified in the SAID principle might prove beneficial to training athletes in overhand throwing sports."

To that end and in partnership with a local not-for-profit service agency, we have carried out an entrepreneurial multi-year interdisciplinary biomedical engineering capstone project that innovatively involves using commercial industrial electronics to make beverage container recycling more worker-friendly, flow efficient and accountable. This one-semester capstone course is required of all who pursue a Biomedical Engineering or a Biomedical Science and Technology minor. Over eight semesters, 5 to 10 engineering and non-engineering students per semester (and one high school student) worked to build, wire, program and test eight highly instrumented multi-hole modular totalizer tables and one calibrated scale that are now in routine daily use. The tables in each facility are networked together and connected via RS485 to an industrial graphical display/ controller so that intake, outtake and flow data can be captured and analyzed. As an example one center handles 4M recyclables a year! The project’s mission is to improve the efficiency of, and maximize the dollar return from, a beverage container recycling business, while taking into account the capabilities of those with disability who are employees, and while demonstrating that recycling is a viable option for a successful supported employment business. Its goals are to 1) prevent overpaying customers at intake and to improve the accuracy of the count when the recyclables were returned to the various vendors; 2) use commercial electronics and design-for-manufacturing concepts so that our products are field-maintainable by the host’s staff, 3) introduce students to the disability field and the concept of supported employment through their own research and by visits to the recycling centers; 4) introduce by hands-on experiences college and high school students of varied backgrounds to industrial electronics’ concepts of sensing, counting and process control; 5) have them participate in a de novo real-world design of a large and complex process, and 6) have them prepare and assemble detailed product manuals for each table for use by maintenance staff, and 7) teach them about cost-accounting and sequential manufacturing planning as a precursor to developing a business plan. Students met for a 1-hr noon planning session on one day, and a 3 or 4 hr work session on another afternoon. No student to date has slacked on doing tasks for the team that needed to be done. All contributed, each in their own way. The best assessment tool has been the 1-page free-form reflection that each student wrote at semester’s end, but each student kept a daily log and the group prepared a final report that included the product manual. Almost all wrote that 1) they learned a lot of new hands-on skills and how to read schematics; 2) they had a different view of those with disability; 3) they liked working on a real problem and doing so as a team; and 4) a good number said that it was the best class that they took at the university (the last comment makes me wonder where the joy resides in other engineering classes!). Funding and in-kind support was received from EPICS in IEEE (Engineering Projects in Service to the Community), StartUp NY, NYSID’s CREATE (Cultivating Resources for Employment with Assistive TEchnology), a university consortium fellowship, and many industrial partners."

https://openalex.org/W3101776838,Using the Entrepreneurial Mindset to Master Kinematics and Human Body Motion in a Biomechanics Course,2020-09-08,2020,article,"Abstract Engineering analysis of the human body through kinematics and dynamic motion can be a challenging task that is daunting to undergraduate students. The analysis process starts by creating a framework of understanding in dynamics, calculus and anatomy and physiology. Most critically, students must develop a concrete knowledge of joint movement, gait and current technologies used to analyze human body motion characterized by locomotion or kinematics [1]. Students then must combine this knowledge with understanding of forces and muscle mechanics to understand how the body generates power or kinetics [2], all working succinctly to perform locomotion. By using a semester-long project to introduce engineers to the entrepreneurial mindset, students are given the chance to engage in difficult technical material in an impactful way while learning new skills not typically taught in the engineering classroom. A major key to the module's success was to allow students to choose their own topic, which allowed them to foster their curiosity and engage more genuinely with the content. Mavromatti et. al also demonstrated the importance of student-selected projects to help with motivation and personal interest with the subject matter [3]. Student feedback on the ability to select the project was observed: “I liked how we had freedom to decide what we wanted to do for our human performance project, it makes the work more fun and felt more like a personal success once it was done.” Above all, this demonstrated the ability of students to make deep connections with the course material, and finding value in their own curiosity driven biomechanics project. The module was designed to be a project based learning (PBL) application of human body motion. Students developed projects that used digital goniometers recorded by PowerLab in ADInstruments LabChart software (ADInstruments, Co, Colorado Springs CO), and video analysis for joint angle, position, veloicty and acceleration of body segments using Kinovea software (Open Source, Kinovea.org). Students designed their own study and executed an experimental setup for collecting human subject data and completed statistical analysis on the data. In addition to the technical content, students were required to think entrepreneurially to develop entrepreneurial minded learning (EML) skills. For project completion, they had to submit an IRB for human subject testing considering the ethical concerns of performing human subject testing. They completed a market analysis report, used scientific data to present technical content in an elevator pitch to stakeholders and delivered a non-technical brief to the CEO of their company. Engineers had to identify a reimbursement strategy to make human body motion data lucrative for their organization. The introduction of business content in a technical course provided an opportunity for engineers to learn how they could become a part of real-world business and organizational teams once they enter the workforce. The data collection tool, to assess the efficacy of this module, was comprised of a student survey delivered before the start of the project and at the conclusion of the work. Surveys were approved by the university's Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to their use. To maintain confidentiality, students were randomly assigned a 6-digit code that was used to pair responses on the pre- and post-module surveys. The surveys consisted of both short answer and multiple choice technical questions regarding the field of biomechanics, as well as 5-choice Likert-scale questions that prompted students to rate their current level of knowledge/ability regarding various EML skills. The greatest improvements in entrepreneurial skills was in investigating the market, and creating a preliminary business model with 94, and 154 increase on Likert-scores, respectively (Student’s t-test: pre- vs. post-survey, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, the student’s sense of ability at evaluating the technical feasibility, customer value and societal benefits or economic feasibility increased by 43% (p&lt;0.001). Students also improved on their ability to identify an opportunity, assess policy and regulatory issues, communicate engineering solutions in economic terms and validate market interest with 29, 44, 56 and 51% increase in Likert-scores, respectively (Student’s t-test: pre- and post-survey scores: p&lt;0.05). In general, the project was well received by the students and demonstrated improved awareness and ability to think with an entrepreneurial mindset. Keys to successful implementation of this module include providing a fast-paced curriculum in the first 6 weeks of class to get all students up to speed on core course material, the laboratory equipment and motion analysis technology, as well as thorough introduction to the project requirements. The faculty member had to be willing to research and develop competencies in several areas including sports performance, injury biomechanics, and clinical assessments of gait and human movement to provide technical feedback throughout the semester. Each project required individualized feedback for design of experiments, statistical analysis, experimental setup and scientific writing. To allow enough student-faculty interaction, the project was run during a 4-hour lab block that met weekly, and was associated with the biomechanics course. The students were given at least 6 weeks of open lab time to specifically work on the project. It was critical to provide rubrics, concrete deadlines and rapid feedback on deliverables throughout the semester to keep students on track and engaged with the material. Overall, students preferred this style of learning and found the project tremendously helpful in creating connections with the course content. This work could serve as a learning opportunity for professors trying to introduce entrepreneurship in a course with rigorous engineering content."
https://openalex.org/W3106929607,Development of a Video Analysis Software for Biomechanics Education,2020-09-08,2020,article,"Abstract A standard biomechanics course ought to cover both 1) tissue mechanics that requires a mechanical testing on biological tissue (in-vitro test) and 2) biomechanics of body motion that requires body motion analysis (in-vivo test). These requirements can lead to a significant financial investment in laboratory space, material testing machine, and motion analysis system. As a result, courses of biomechanics often result in a “chalk and board” lecture without hands-on experiments for students. To resolve the challenge confronting the expenses for biomechanics courses, we have modified the previously developed virtual mechanics laboratory (VML) software, which allows users to analyze digital video images captured from a moving body and/or deforming tissues, with a well-developed digital image analysis algorithm. Originally, VML was developed to as the supplemental virtual experimental tool for Dynamics and Mechanics of material courses. A new data matching module is created and added for the application of biomechanics education. In addition to the software modification, we have created new experiment protocols to achieve both mechanical testing on biological tissue and body motion analysis with the software. The VML software consists of following four modules: 1) Video edit module: User will be able edit the length of captured video to a proper length. 2) Dynamics module: User will be able to conduct motion/pixel tracking with an algorithm termed “Digital Image Correlation”. Measured data (displacement and angle change) can be exported as a EXCEL format data for analysis. 3) Mechanics of material module: User will be able to select a region of interest (ROI) in a video image (digital camera video or medical ultrasound video) captured from the deforming tissue. This module will evaluate the tissue deformation (strains). The measured data (strains) can be exported for analysis. 4) Data matching module: User will be able to match (synchronize) the data collected from different testing devices with a technique termed “least square correlation”. The data matching module makes the in-vivo analysis possible. For example, user can simultaneously video record 1) the body motion with a digital camera and 2) in-vivo tissue deformation with a medical ultrasound (B mode ultrasound video) at the time of experiment. Subsequently, user will be able to match two data deduced from two different modules, e.g. angle changes of a foot and tissue strain of Achilles tendon for further analysis. Following the development of VML software, three types of experiment protocols have been drafted. a). Motion analysis protocol: 1) Capture video images of the body motion with a digital camera. 2) Edit the video length in edit module and conduct motion tracking to evaluate the displacement/angle of body parts and export data. 3) Complete the motion analysis utilizing the collected data. b). In vitro tissue mechanical testing protocol: 1) Mount a tissue sample on the tester and capture a video image of a deforming tissue with a digital camera or an ultrasound. 2) Conduct ROI tracking to evaluate tissue deformation 3) Synchronize tissue deformation and applied-force recorded from tester and export data. 4) Evaluate tissue properties using collected data. c). In vivo tissue properties evaluation test protocol: 1) Capture a video image of a body motion to ultrasound image of a deforming tissue. 2) Conduct motion analysis and tissue deformation analysis by using dynamics and mechanical of material module. 3) Synchronize two data deduced in step 2) and export data. 4) Evaluate tissue properties. The VML software and the new experiment protocols will be tested in the brand-new biomechanics course at University of XXXXXX starting in Fall-semester 2020. Because Biomechanics course has never been offered at our university, the efficacy of new software and experiment protocols cannot be examined by conducting statistical analysis on grades of past and new students. Instead, we plan to 1) compare the scores of the quizzes administered at pre- (post- lecture) and post- laboratory and 2) conduct survey among students to check the efficacy of the VML software and experiment protocol."

 Study design: Cross-sectional study
 Participants and methods: The research included 110 adult football players from Slavonia and Baranja who play football either for recreational purposes, semi-professionally or professionally. All participants agreed to be part of the anonymous online survey. A program used for statistical analysis was MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.1.7. The normality of the distribution of numerical variables was tested by Shapiro - Wilk test. Numerical data are described by median and interquartile range.
 Results: The ankle injury is the most common in football players, followed by hamstrings injury and wrist bone fractures. Ankle injury is found in all sports positions, while rotator cuff muscle injury is typical for goalkeepers. We did not find a difference in injuries between individual leagues. The correlation between injuries and the duration of recovery is found only in specific injuries such as wrist bone fractures, forearm and upper arm fractures as well as tennis elbow, lasting one month. We did not find correlation between age and injury, or between recovery time and age. We were unable to differentiate a specific physiotherapy procedure with individual injuries.
 Conclusion: The most common injury in football players is ankle injury, which is related to all playing positions. Due to the biomechanics and kinesiology, goalkeepers have problems with the rotator cuff muscles. The specificity of injuries determines the recovery time. Larger number of respondents within all Croatian leagues and a more detailed description of injuries are needed to make the results more credible."

The techniques developed to validate stretchable soft robotic sensors (SRS) as a means for collecting human kinetic and kinematic data at the foot-ankle complex and at the wrist are reviewed. Lessons learned from past experiments are addressed, as well as what comprises the current SSTK based on what the researchers learned over the course of multiple studies. Three core components of the SSTK are featured: (a) material testing tools, (b) data analysis software, and (c) data collection devices. Results collected indicate that the stretch sensors are a viable means for predicting kinematic data based on the most recent gait analysis study conducted by the researchers (average root mean squared error or RMSE = 3.63°). With the aid of SSTK defined in this study summary and shared with the academic community on GitHub, researchers will be able to undergo more rigorous validation methodologies of SRS validation. A summary of the current state of the SSTK is detailed and includes insight into upcoming experiments that will utilize more sophisticated techniques for fatigue testing and gait analysis, utilizing SRS as the data collection solution."

Damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee joint is a common injury in sports medicine. Before advances in arthroscopy and surgical techniques, an ACL damage was considered a career ending injury for many athletes. Since the 1990s, there has been a rapid development of arthroscopic surgery for ACL and continuous improvement of these techniques. Today’s athletes can expect a pre-injury level of stability and function after an ACL reconstruction. Modern surgical interventions have come a long way, having studied both the successes and failures of previous surgical techniques. In the United States, an ACL damage is diagnosed annually from 100,000 to 200,000 cases, making this the most common ligament injury [9, 10]. This number continues to increase in both the general population and in individuals who play sports. Football players sustain the greatest number of ACL injuries (53% of the total), with skiers and gymnasts also at high risk. The history of ACL reconstruction can be traced as far back as the Egyptians times. Research and innovation are constantly evolving, and this leads to improved clinical results. The knowledge of the evolution of ACL reconstruction is invaluable to those who continue to try to improve the outcomes of the procedure and reduce the risks of repeating mistakes of the past."

Previous literature utilizing diffusion tensor imaging in sports-related concussion has exhibited notable variety of analysis methods and analyzed regions of interest, and largely focuses on acute effects of concussion. The current study aimed to compare diffusivity metrics across a single season within athlete cohorts with no history of concussion.Methods A prospective cohort of 75 contact and 79 non-contact division I athletes were compared across diffusion tensor imaging metrics (i.e. TRACULA); examinations were also performed assessing the relationship between neuroimaging metrics, head impact exposure metrics (in-helmet accelerometer), and neurocognitive variables. Assessment occurred at pre-and post-season time points.Results Seasonal changes in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values did not differ between athlete cohorts, nor did they differ within cohort groups, across pre- and post-season scans. Specific to contact athletes, positive associations were found between uncinate fasciculus mean diffusivity values and season linear acceleration (p =.018), season rotational acceleration (p =.017), and season hit severity (p =.021).Conclusions Results suggest an influence of impact frequency, type, and severity on white matter integrity in select brain regions in contact athletes. Current findings expand our knowledge of anatomical changes over the course of a single season, and underscore the importance of considering methodology when interpreting findings in this population, as differing image analysis techniques may lead to different conclusions regarding significant effects."
https://openalex.org/W2615010788,"Service-Learning vs. Learning Service in First-year Engineering: If We Cannot Conduct First-Hand Service Projects, is it Still of Value?",2020-09-04,2020,article,"Abstract Service-Learning vs. Learning Service in Engineering DesignThe literature and 10 to 15 years of practice at many Universities have clearly demonstrated thatService-Learning provides benefits to both the community and the students’ learning withincreased levels of social responsibility [1,2,3,4]. In the College of Engineering at UnnamedUniversity the integration of service learning projects in a first-year Introduction to EngineeringDesign course has been considered for a number of years. But with 500+ first-year students, themanagement and administration of Service-Learning projects seemed daunting withoutsignificant resources provided to support the effort. The implementation by the first-yearGateway Faculty requires coordination and development of upwards of 160 projects that involvemany community partners providing a wide range of services. To assess the merits of such anundertaking, it was decided to first develop design projects with a theme of having a societalbenefit; topics with humanitarian and service focus, that impact the local community, or even aglobal impact. Do these projects affect the students’ in a way similar to Service-Learning? Afterworking on these service projects, do the students have a changed perspective on engineeringthat includes helping and serving others? To answer these questions a pre- and post- projectsurvey was given to all first-year engineering students to assess if their focus had been impactedas a result of working on and seeing presentations of engineering design in Service Projects.The dual-phase survey was entitled ‘Engineering in Society’, and was administered to more than500 first-year students in the Engineering Design Classes. The pre-survey was given early in thesemester before the design projects were started. The first part of the pre-survey assessed theirfamiliarity with current events locally and globally, and the sources of their information, alongwith basic demographics on selected majors in engineering. This was followed by a series ofquestions on their knowledge of human needs, organizations, and services. The bulk of thesurvey focused on identifying engineering roles such as: engineers produce products, engineershelp improve lives, design systems, work for non-profit organizations. The post survey wasgiven during the last week of classes after the completion of the design project and wasdeveloped to measure the student’s changes in perceptions of engineering. Responses andstatements that were evaluated can be seen in the following tables. Both pre and post surveyswill be in the included in the paper’s appendix, along with the list of design project topics.Table 1. Familiarity with the following Human services areas, 1 = not familiar, 5 = very familiar Human services Before After Statistically significant? Housing Aid 2.27 2.63 Yes p <.0001These results show that while there was some student awareness coming into the course, therewas a post-survey increase in knowledge of human services organizations and an increasedawareness that they might have a role in non-profit organizations. It appears that our studentshave a fairly balanced understanding that engineers produce products and serve others indifferent ways. Anecdotally from years past, if not guided, students would select design projectsto create products that helped them as individuals or were familiar to their activities and lives,rarely choosing to focus on a societal need. Some of the results from the last series of questionsfrom the post-survey were quite compelling as shown in Table 3: their perspective and attitudetoward future engineering work has changed due to their initial engineering design projects.Table 3. Likert responses on the class effect on humanitarian awareness. Disagree = 1 Agree = 5Statement MeanThis class caused me to feel more concerned about social problems. 3.28I now have a stronger sense of civic responsibility to become involved in my 3.19community because of this class project.This class has helped me to gain a clearer idea of my professional goals. 3.80It is likely I will volunteer on a non-profit project in the future because of this class. 3.19It is notable that the means are above neutral, showing a tendency toward change. This iscertainly a positive result, given that the students are not actually working with a service project,and still have a stronger sense of civic responsibility and are considering volunteering.Furthermore, the experiences in Engineering Design class seemed to provide students moreclarity on professional goals, which as an overall result is propitious for first-year classes. In thisfirst semester at Unnamed University, 40% of the students are often undecided on a major, sosome increase in understanding their goals is a desired outcome. Overall, these results areencouraging; the use of humanitarian and service oriented projects increases the perceivedbreadth of engineering application areas, and students’ knowledge of socially responsibleopportunities as well as their potential roles as engineers. The purpose of this paper andpresentation is to describe in detail the survey, salient results of the study plus information usefulfor implementation of the projects used in the course.ReferencesAstin, A., Vogelgesang, L., Ikeda, E., & Yee, J.

Robotics teams and competitions have beensuggested as an avenue to increase student interest in science, technology, engineering, andmathematics (STEM), but research on their effects is sparse. Given that a number of researchstudies suggest student disengagement in STEM begins between ages 10 to 15 (Institution ofEngineering and Technology, 2008), a program such as FLL that targets this age group providesa valuable opportunity to investigate impact of participation on student perception and interest inSTEM.The purpose of this study is to describe (1) student and mentor perceptions of the benefits ofFLL, (2) changes in students’ perceptions about math and science, and (3) changes in students’interest in science or engineering careers. Study participants are 4th through 8th grade students(n =200) on 22 FLL teams in an urban area of the southeast United States. Their adult mentors (n=20) are also participants in the study.

https://openalex.org/W2735202500,Engineering Camp: A Residential Experience Designed to Build Academic Capital in Pre-college Students,2020-09-04,2020,article,"Abstract Engineering Camp: a residential experience designed to build academic capital in pre-college studentsEngineering Camp is a one-week on-campus residential program that exposes pre-college (post7th -11th grade) students to engineering disciplines through introductory seminars,demonstrations, laboratory experiments, and design challenges. The program improves students’awareness of the breadth of engineering and emphasizes the benefit of developing skills inSTEM. The camp is offered in grade-based parallel sessions geared to the audience, and camperscan return in subsequent summers. Importantly, the camp provides a college-like experience thatis integral to building academic capital and a sense of belonging for students.During Camp students live in dormitories, eat in the university dining hall, go to class eachmorning, have laboratory sessions each afternoon, enjoy an active “social life” (under closesupervision), and get a full college experience. The main goal of the camp is to introducestudents to engineering disciplines in a way that motivates and prepares them for undergraduatemajors. Camp features highly active classroom and laboratory sessions that introduce thesetechnical topics not through lecture or ‘cook-book’ laboratory, but through active, collaborative,and problem-based learning approaches shown to be not only more effective at fostering studentunderstanding than traditional approaches, but also superior for retaining the most diverseaudience of learners1-4. Camp particularly reaches out to students in urban and rural under-resourced schools who might not otherwise be exposed to topics in engineering and technologybefore graduation, and therefore would not have prepared themselves for or even considered anundergraduate major in a STEM field.Campers come from a variety of educational and economic backgrounds, and some students arerecruited from partner schools in target rural and urban areas. An additional goal for EngineeringCamp is to remove the mystique about going to college and majoring in a technical field. Manyof the campers, particularly those from under-resourced urban and rural areas, would be first-generation college students, without the family academic capital that could help them prepare foruniversity processes5. Camp provides a safe environment to become comfortable with residentialliving learning environments. Both class and laboratory content are challenging but tailored to beinteresting to students aged 13-16. By engaging these students in activities that closely mimicthose of typical undergraduates in an engineering or technical major, their apprehension aboutcollege in general and difficult curricula in particular are significantly lessened.In addition to cumulative assessment over several years, the paper will discuss camper surveyresults that show a strong positive response to questions (related to camp attendance) such as: “Iam ( more likely, as likely, less likely) to pursue an undergraduate engineering major.”; “I ( can,can sort of, can’t really, can’t at all) imagine myself as a practicing engineer.”; “I am ( veryconfident; confident; not very confident; not at all confident) in my potential to solve engineeringproblems.”1.

Innovating and adapting to this new, complex environment is critical to surviving in the global economy. The challenge is to generate “good” ideas and rapidly convert them to viable commercial products. In the product development process, proof-of-concept systems are built to determine the feasibility of products or processes. It is essential for today’s engineers and scientists to understand systems engineering principles and have the knowledge and experience in integrating systems to test the efficacy of their ideas. To this end, we have developed the Sensor and Controller System Integration course that enables students to rapidly metamorphose their ideas to proof-of-concept systems for high-tech applications using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. This paper presents the course philosophy, curriculum, instructional strategy, preliminary assessment results and the teaching tools employed to enhance the students’ entrepreneurial experience. Introduction Frans Johansson, in his book The Medici Effect1 recounts the story of the Medicis, a banking family in Florence who were patrons in a wide range of disciplines. Due to the Medicis and a few other like-minded families, sculptors, scientists, poets, philosophers, financiers, painters, and architects from all over Europe and as far as China converged upon the city of Florence. There they found each other, learned from one another, and broke down the barriers between their disciplines and cultures. Together they formed a new world based on new ideas—what became known as the Rinascimento or the Renaissance. As a result, the city became the epicenter of a creative explosion and one of the most innovative eras in history followed. Johansson calls this phenomenon the “Medici Effect.” The maximum probability of groundbreaking and revolutionary advances is at the convergence of concepts, disciplines, countries, and cultures and is accelerated by modern computational power, communication infrastructure, and easy access to information for everyone. Can we recreate the scenarios that preceded and propelled the Renaissance in our quest for promoting entrepreneurship education? Using modern technology, can we bring together wildly different ideas from various disciplines and rapidly explore the potential of the resulting numerous unique concept combinations to become radical innovations? Are we on the verge of a new high-tech renaissance? With advancing and evolving technologies, the primary challenges in engineering product development have shifted from creating well defined components to producing complex, interdependent systems. Innovating and adapting to this new, complex environment is critical to surviving in the global economy. Successful organizations, including universities, indicate that the real source of power in a knowledge-based economy is in combining technical prowess with"

Self, PhD, John J. Wood, PhD, Dave Hansen, PhD Department of Engineering Mechanics United States Air Force Academy Colorado Springs, Colorado Abstract Students often struggle with the fundamental concepts covered in a first course in rigid body dynamics. Difficulty visualizing the connection between homework assignments and real world situations and low motivation for solving seemingly contrived problems only compounds the problem of understanding and correctly applying the learned material. To add student motivation and increase interest in the study of kinetics, a course project has been developed at the United States Air Force Academy using the LEGO® Mindstorms Project kit. The project involves the design and construction of a race car capable of competing in both a maximum speed as well as a hill climb competition with minimal configuration changes. Following introduction of the project, various homework problems were also developed and integrated into the project to increase the hands-on design, construction, and analysis components. Experimental determination of the mass moment of inertia of wheels and axles, analytical study of go cart dynamics, experimental determination of center of mass and other assignments are used to prepare the students for a detailed analysis of their race car. Students used these problems to analytically determine the maximum acceleration of their cars during a 50-foot race and the time required to complete a hill climbing contest. The stall torque of the car’s motor(s) is calculated using an incline test, then compared to the published motor torque of 0.276 in-lbs. If the students choose to use gearing or pulleys for their cars, they are required to calculate the effective output torque using appropriate gear ratios and estimated power losses. Using the determined values for the vehicle center of mass, the mass moment of inertia, and the motor torque, the students calculated the cars’ theoretical acceleration. As a final analysis, the calculated performance is compared to the actual acceleration of the car from timed races. Students seemed to enjoy building the cars, and really enjoyed the competitive races that are performed at the end of the project. The LEGO® Mindstorms Car Competition provides a fun, real world problem that helps motivate students to learn rigid body dynamics.

Vigeant, Stephanie Butler Velegol, James W. Baish, Richard J. Kozick, Richard Zaccone, Ronald D. Ziemian All: Bucknell University College of Engineering. Departments: Chemical Engineering/ Chemical Engineering/ Mechanical Engineering/ Electrical Engineering/ Computer Science and Engineering/ Civil and Environmental Engineering Abstract Bucknell University requires all incoming engineering students to take an introductory engineering course. The course is typically taught by a team of six faculty and has an enrollment of over 200, while the size of a typical class at Bucknell is below 35. While this course has been successful at achieving its objectives in the past, it was felt that it could be improved in terms of class size and depth of coverage. This year the class was taught in four segments. The first segment was not altered – lectures were delivered to the whole class in the traditional manner, combined with smaller laboratory segments. Lectures included: engineering as a profession, the engineering design process, information on each engineering discipline, teamwork and learning styles. This was complemented by a team project in which students used the engineering design process to design a park. For the second and third segment, students were able to choose two of six quasi- major-specific seminars. Each three-week seminar had a class size around 33 students, a lab size of about 16 students, and featured a team-based hands-on project. Seminar titles included: Engineering Athletics, Programming a Computer, Green Engineering, Flinging Things, Pasta Towers and Digital Logic Design. Not only did these seminars allow a smaller classroom setting and more in-depth study, we found that it provided an opportunity for both students and faculty to take ownership of the course. The final section was also taught in the large classroom setting and centered on ethics and professional responsibility. This segment included laboratory discussions of ethics and discussions of books focused on engineering and society. It is our observation that this course structure resulted in a more optimal mix of breadth and depth, while giving students in a large course a small class experience.

Self, Keith Bearden, Matthew Obenchain and Daniel Diaz US Air Force Academy, Colorado ABSTRACT In most Engineering curricula, the courses are somewhat disjointed with very few projects or concepts tying classes together. In the Engineering Mechanics Department at the US Air Force Academy, we have the opportunity to create a common thread through at least a few of the cadets’ senior level classes. At the same time, it is possible to involve the students in some research at the undergraduate level. Example projects that are used in courses involving experimental mechanics, finite element analysis, independent research, and competition teams will be presented, and benefits of this integrated approach discussed. INTRODUCTION When students enter most engineering programs, they are presented with many different tools to use in their chosen field. Engineering Mechanics curricula may include mechanics of materials, dynamics, materials sciences, fluid flow, and failure analysis. While these courses provide valuable skills to place in their engineering toolbox, they are often disjointed. The advent of capstone design projects had done much to help students synthesize what they must know as engineers, but often the scope of these projects is limited. Team sizes may be so large as to prohibit true synthesis, as the students tend to “divide and conquer” to complete the project. Some programs have been able to make large gains in integrating their curricula, but most involve the first two years of studies.1-5 While these efforts have made great strides in improving the students’ introduction to the engineering field, they do not fully test the students’ ability to apply their upper level course knowledge to solve engineering problems. Engineering projects that can be used in several different courses may prove useful in forcing the students to assimilate their engineering knowledge and will also serve to introduce them to research. The US Air Force Academy is an undergraduate only institution; therefore faculty must recruit undergraduates to perform research if they need assistance. Currently, the time demands on most faculty are too great to allow significant research to be accomplished. Instructors usually teach three to four section of classes each semester, and typically must double prep. Unless they can obtain assistance from undergraduate students, it may be impossible to perform data collection and analysis. Faculty members are encouraged to mentor cadets in their research to introduce the future officers to the scientific method. Many cadets author abstracts each year at USAFA, and a current goal of the research community is to produce even more research publications in the coming years. The cadets’ time is in even more demand than that of the faculty. It is extremely difficult for most cadets to devote the amount of time necessary to create a research product worthy of Proceedings of the 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition Copyright © 2002, American Society for Engineering Education Main Menu"

Yet for some individuals, sports and recreation may beassociated with the word “fun”, while science, math and engineering may be equated with thewords “hard” or “difficult”. Get SSET (Sport Science, Engineering and Technology) was firstdeveloped in 2003 as an innovative week-long summer residential sports engineering academyfor girls entering grades 9 through 11. The academy has been conducted at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and the University of San Diego.The academy focuses on empowering female students with technical skills and success strategiesthrough exciting sports STEM lectures and hands-on activities in a gender-neutral environment.A key component of the program is that instructors are university faculty and/or professionals insports science, engineering or math. The on-campus environment is used as a stimulus to excitestudents about college/university education and an engineering, science, math or technologyrelated career.The presentation and paper will cover best practices developed over the past nine years,including academy logistics (funding, costs, “after-hour” classroom engagement, studentselection criteria, academy schedule of activities) and share the variety of classroom content thathas been used. For example, past academies have included design methodology for an equestriansaddle for a paraplegic, athletic footwear design for a triathlete, and wind tunnel testing ofstudent redesigned cycling helmets for drag reduction. Additionally, a summary of studentlongitudinal tracking, student evaluations and parent surveys (conducted 2-4 months after theacademy) will be provided.In sports engineering it is critical to understand and embrace physiological differencesthroughout the human life cycle (age), for both genders and for varying physical abilities anddisabilities. This theme has been used throughout the academy to emphasize that understandingdiversity is critical in obtaining good sports engineering solutions."

This paper presents therefore our current research results on curriculum planning and evaluation of the mechanical engineering course based on the learning outcomes proposed in ABET EC-2000, with example of the course “Mechanisms”. With aid of attributes from the framework developed by Besterfield-Sacre et al. we developed the outcomes and the corresponding teaching strategies. For assessment of learning, we devised also a questionnaire for further evaluation. The new results of evaluation and assessment in the current semester will be presented and discussed in this paper. The significance of the study is to give an example for engineering educators in Taiwan, how to apply ABET-EC 2000 to curriculum planning and evaluation of the mechanical engineering courses. Keyword: ABET EC-2004, Mechanisms, learning outcome, Mechantronic Platform 1. Introduction Our worry about the Taiwanese students’ competence to face the challenge of global competition is gradually starker. Especially our faculty has some lingering sense of dissatisfaction to students, such as low learning motivation, little demonstration of higher order skills, too little autonomy etc. One of the attempts for engineering education reform in Taiwan is to introduce accrediting programs into colleges. In order to examine the core competence of student defined by ABET EC-2000, we aimed thus to develop a similar methodology under a three-year integrated project through a joint research group from the National Central University, and Yuan Ze University. The cooperation of interdisciplinary expertise is intended to develop a series of guidelines to help the faculty to review the objectives of curriculum planning and teaching plan, so as to evaluate “Proceedings of the 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition Copyright © 2005, American Society for Engineering Education”"

Methods A retrospective study conducted from December 2015 to December 2019, includes 86 males who involved chronic fatigue （determined by the fatigue self-assessment scale ）and present symptoms of knee pain with no trauma. For those who diagnosed with ACL lesion, we recorded their basic characteristics such as age, BMI（kg/m 2 ）, daily training time, etc. and carried out some tests on them to evaluate their clinical performance and observed their manifestations under X-ray, MRI and arthroscopy around the treatment procedure. Results Of all 86 males with ACL lesion, 59 patients were injured in the left knee while 27 in the right knee. Age, weekly training intensity, BMI, and knee hyperextension are independent influence factors for ACL lesion through multivariate analysis. Physical examinations and radiologic features included resting pain(23[26.7%]); standing pain(56[65.1%]); exercising pain(86[100%]); “powerless knee”(34[39.5%]); anterior patellar pain(41[47.7%]); knee axis tenderness(38[44.2%]); first degree positive in ADT test(34[39.5%]); second to third degree positive in ADT test(23[26.7%]); positive in Lachman test(73[84.9%]); positive in pivot shift test(5[5.8%]); ACL cyst(15[17.4%]); ACL thickness change(75[87.2%]); PCL tortuosity(35[40.7%]); synovitis(80[93.0%]); intra-articular effusion(79[91.9%]). Conclusion The main risk factor of ACL lesion is patients’ training experience time. Knee pain, mild anterior instability of knee joint, synovitis and intra-articular effusion are the most typical clinical manifestations of ACL patients."

Since our bodies are not symmetric, the direction of the force matters, and must be accounted for by ride designers. An additional complication is that not all parts of the body accelerate in the same way when the acceleration is changing, i.e. when there is jerk. Softer parts of the body provide varying levels of damping, and different parts of the body have different frequency responses and different resonance frequencies that should be avoided or reduced by the roller coaster designer. This paper discusses the effect of acceleration, jerk, snap and vibration on the experience and safety of roller coaster rides, using authentic data from a dive coaster as an example."

The purpose of this study was to characterize downward phase strategies and associated temporal, kinematic and kinetic CMJ variables. One hundred and seventy-eight NBA (National Basketball Association) players (23.6 ± 3.7 years, 200.3 ± 8.0 cm; 99.4 ± 11.7 kg; CMJ height 68.7 ± 7.4 cm) performed three maximal CMJs. Force plate and 3D motion capture data were integrated to obtain kinematic and kinetic outputs. Afterwards, athletes were split into clusters based on downward phase characteristics (k-means cluster analysis). Lower limb joint angular displacement (i.e., delta flexion) explained the highest portion of point variability (89.3%), and three clusters were recommended (Ball Hall Index). Delta flexion was significantly different between clusters and players were characterized as “stiff flexors”, “hyper flexors”, or “hip flexors”. There were no significant differences in jump height between clusters (p &gt; 0.05). Multiple regression analyses indicated that most of the jumping height variance was explained by the same four variables, (i.e., sum concentric relative force, knee extension velocity, knee extension acceleration, and height) regardless of the cluster (p &lt; 0.05). However, each cluster had its own unique set of secondary predictor variables."
https://openalex.org/W3082726197,Force experienced by the head during heading is influenced more by speed than the mechanical properties of the football,2020-09-02,2020,article,"There are growing concerns about the risk of neurodegenerative diseases associated with heading in football. It is essential to understand the biomechanics of football heading to guide player protection strategies to reduce the severity of the impact. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of football speed, mass, and stiffness on the forces experienced during football heading using mathematical and human body computational model simulations. Previous research indicates that a football header can be modeled as a lumped mass mathematical model with elastic contact. Football headers were then reconstructed using a human body modeling approach. Simulations were run by independently varying the football mass, speed, and stiffness. Peak contact force experienced by the head was extracted from each simulation. The mathematical and human body computational model simulations indicate that the force experienced by the head was directly proportional to the speed of the ball and directly proportional to the square root of the ball stiffness and mass. Over the practical range of ball speed, mass, and stiffness, the force experienced by the head during football heading is mainly influenced by the speed of the ball rather than its mass or stiffness. The findings suggest that it would be more beneficial to develop player protection strategies that aim to reduce the speed at which the ball is traveling when headed by a player. Law changes reducing high ball speeds could be trialed at certain age grades or as a phased introduction to football heading."

It is imperative to establish a gold-standard diagnostic test to quickly and accurately diagnose concussion. In this non-randomized, prospective study, we examined the reliability and validity of a novel neurocognitive assessment tool, the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA), designed to be a more sensitive, yet efficient, measure of concussion symptomatology. In this study, the DANA Brief version was compared to an established measure of concussion screening, the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation (MACE), in a group of non-concussed service members. DANA Brief subtests demonstrated low to moderate reliability, as measured by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC; values range: 0.28 – 0.58), which is comparable to other computerized neurocognitive tests that are widely-implemented to diagnose concussion. Statistically significant associations were found between learning and memory components of the DANA Brief and the diagnostic MACE cognitive test score (DANA Brief subtests: CDD: R2 = 0.05, p = 0.023; CDS: R2 = 0.10, p = 0.010). However, a more robust relationship was found between DANA Brief components involving attention and working memory, including immediate memory, and the MACE cognitive test score (DANA Brief subtests: GNG: R2 = 0.08, p = 0.003; PRO: R2 = 0.08, p = 0.002). These results provide evidence that the DANA Rapid version, a five-minute assessment self-administered on a hand-held portable device, based on the DANA Brief version, may serve as a clinically useful and improved neurocognitive concussion screen to minimize the time between injury and diagnosis in settings where professional medical evaluation may be unavailable or delayed. The DANA's portability, durability, shorter test time and lack of need for a medical professional to diagnose concussion overcome these critical limitations of the MACE."

The hamstring injury seems to be difficult to prevent. “The bumpy road to effective hamstring injury prevention in male amateur soccer players” describes studies about preventing the first hamstring injury and about safe return to play after a hamstring injury. With these studies, we come another step closer to the solution for the hamstring injury problem. This thesis contains, studies about risk factors, reasons to (not) execute injury prevention programs as prescribed and studies about effects of jump training to prevent hamstring injuries prevention and to improve performance. This thesis has been established in close collaboration with the KNVB and underlines the complexity of the hamstring injury. Surprisingly the results were not as expected. An effective hamstring injury prevention program that reduced hamstring injury incidence by 2/3, is hardly executed in daily soccer practice. Furthermore, jump training was thought to be effective for multiple reasons. We found no preventive effect on hamstring injuries, but jump training did improve performance. In conclusion, an effective hamstring injury prevention program is hardly executed in daily practice and jump training improves performance but does not prevent hamstring injuries.

https://openalex.org/W3089532229,The Training-Performance Puzzle: How Can the Past Inform Future Training Directions?,2020-09-01,2020,article,"Over the past 20 years, research on the training-load–injury relationship has grown exponentially. With the benefit of more data, our understanding of the training-performance puzzle has improved. What were we thinking 20 years ago, and how has our thinking changed over time? Although early investigators attributed overuse injuries to excessive training loads, it has become clear that rapid spikes in training load, above what an athlete is accustomed, explain (at least in part) a large proportion of injuries. In this respect, it appears that overuse injuries may arise from athletes being underprepared for the load they are about to perform. However, a question of interest to both athletic trainers (ATs) and researchers is why some athletes sustain injury at low training loads, while others can tolerate much greater training loads? A higher chronic training load and well-developed aerobic fitness and lower body strength appear to moderate the training-injury relationship and provide a protective effect against spikes in load. The training-performance puzzle is complex and dynamic—at any given time, multiple inputs to injury and performance exist. The challenge facing researchers is obtaining large enough longitudinal data sets to capture the time-varying nature of physiological and musculoskeletal capacities and training-load data to adequately inform injury-prevention efforts. The training-performance puzzle can be solved, but it will take collaboration between researchers and clinicians as well as an understanding that efficacy (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in an idealized or controlled setting) does not equate to effectiveness (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in the real-world setting, where many variables cannot be controlled)."

The main body of the final classification criteria consists of six types of OA pathogenesis, eight types of medical findings (which can be grouped into two categories), and six types of the location. The final criteria include load-based type, structure-based type, inflammation-based type, metabolic-based type, systemic factor based type and mixed type.COACH can better help clinicians quickly classify OA patients and help to choose the best treatment option from the aspects of types, findings and locations. What's more, the classification criteria are also helpful to promote the basic medical research and targeted prevention of OA."

The different measures we collected by the 3D motion capture system Movit G1 and the High-Speed Camera (240 fps) were considered as dependent variables, whereas the gender was considered as the independent one.Twenty soccer well trained non-professional players: 10 men (age: 25.3±6.5 yrs; height 1.80±0.07 m; body mass 76.9±13.2 kg) and 10 women (age: 19±3.34 yrs; height 1.64±0.07 m; body mass 58.2±7.2 kg) volunteered to participate in the study.Gender differences were found, with a statistical significance (P<0.05) or interesting magnitude (Cohen d>0.5). The most relevant ones were the differences in hip extension of the kicking leg when the foot of the supporting one touches the ground, just before the impact on the ball (independent sample t-Test; P=0.03; Cohen d=1.64) and the speed of the ball, reached immediately after kicking (P<0.001;d=1.23).These results, together with the greater pelvic acceleration shown by men compared to women, highlight the need to develop a gender-differentiated training model, in order to customize the kicking technique in women and to reduce the likelihood, currently higher than for men, of kicking related injuries."

However, many patients want to return to sport, and this is often beneficial for them. Therefore, we should know how meniscal allograft transplantation performs in terms of return to sport to better counsel our patients. It is thus of primary importance to discuss general and sport-related expectations with each patient, whom should be informed of the potential short- and long-term risks of strenuous or light sport activities. In particular, the high risk of reoperation, the long recovery time, and the potentially deleterious effect of sporting activity on graft survival should be quite clear to both surgeons and patients because, when it comes to return-to-sport decisions, ""It takes two to tango""!"

The clinical picture of every child with autism is different. The spectrum of symptoms includes a number of characteristic features that the patient manifests. Patients often have the problem of coexisting disorders. Difficulties in communication often make it difficult to diagnose. Hence the strictly individualized rehabilitation program, which should be tailored to the needs and preferences of the patient. Effective therapy should be carried out, taking into account the patient’s motivation and pleasure. Aim A systematic review of publications for the most commonly used therapies in the rehabilitation of patients with autism and their effectiveness confirmed scientifically. Material and methods A review of the literature on the PubMed search engine has been made since 2000. Search terms used: ‘autism’, ‘ASD’, ‘therapy’, ‘physiotherapy’, ‘rehabilitation’. Results Among the articles found in the PubMed search after entering keywords, it can be stated that the majority of publications concerned alternative medicine, especially animal therapy. Others have also appeared, e.g. manual therapy, martial arts, acupuncture, choreotherapy or music therapy. Conclusions Children with autism spectrum disorders require constant rehabilitation. The form it takes depends individually on the patient’s current state. The chosen therapy may affect one deficit aspect of the child, but not improve another, for which the next treatment is required to improve. Analysis of the publication, however, indicates the positive impact of rehabilitation in children with autism."

https://openalex.org/W3113871565,Dynamic Strength Index: Relationships with Common Performance Variables and Contextualization of Training Recommendations,2020-08-31,2020,article,"Abstract The purposes of this study were to examine the relationships between dynamic strength index (DSI) and other strength-power performance characteristics and to contextualize DSI scores using case study comparisons. 88 male and 67 female NCAA division I collegiate athletes performed countermovement jumps (CMJ) and isometric mid-thigh pulls (IMTP) during a pre-season testing session as part of a long-term athlete monitoring program. Spearman’s correlations were used to assess the relationships between DSI and CMJ peak force, height, modified reactive strength index, peak power and IMTP peak force and rate of force development (RFD). Very large relationships existed between DSI and IMTP peak force (r = -0.848 and -0.746), while small-moderate relationships existed between DSI and CMJ peak force (r = 0.297 and 0.313), height (r = 0.108 and 0.167), modified reactive strength index (r = 0.174 and 0.274), and IMTP RFD (r = -0.341 and -0.338) for men and women, respectively. Finally, relationships between DSI and CMJ peak power were trivial-small for male (r = 0.008) and female athletes (r = 0.191). Case study analyses revealed that despite similar DSI scores, each athlete’s percentile rankings for each variable and CMJ force-time characteristics were unique, which may suggest different training emphases are needed. Based on the explained variance, an athlete’s IMTP performance may have a larger influence on their DSI score compared to the CMJ. DSI scores should be contextualized using additional performance data to ensure each individual athlete receives the appropriate training stimulus during different training phases throughout the year."
https://openalex.org/W3082684538,Short-term Response of Serum Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein to Different Types of Impact Loading Under Normal and Artificial Gravity,2020-08-31,2020,article,"Microgravity during long-term space flights induces degeneration of articular cartilage. Artificial gravity through centrifugation combined with exercise has been suggested as a potential countermeasure for musculo-skeletal degeneration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different types of impact loading under normal and artificial gravity conditions on serum concentrations of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a biomarker of cartilage metabolism. Fifteen healthy male adults (26±4 years, 181±4 cm, 77±6 kg) performed four different 30-min impact loading protocols on four experimental days: jumping with artificial gravity elicited by centrifugation in a short-arm centrifuge (AGJ), jumping with artificial gravity generated by low-pressure cylinders in a sledge jump system (SJS), vertical jumping under Earth gravity (EGJ) and running under Earth gravity (RUN). Five blood samples per protocol were taken: 30 min before, immediately before, immediately after, 30 min after, and 60 min after impact loading. Serum COMP concentrations were analyzed in these samples. During the impact exercises, ground reaction forces were recorded. Peak ground reaction forces were significantly different between the three jumping protocols (p < 0.001), increasing from AGJ (14 N/kg) to SJS (22 N/kg) to EGJ (29 N/kg) but were similar in RUN (22 N/kg) compared to SJS. The serum COMP concentration was increased (p < 0.001) immediately after all loading protocols and then decreased (p < 0.001) at 30 min post-exercise compared to immediately after the exercise. Jumping and running under Earth gravity (EGJ and RUN) resulted in a significantly higher (p < 0.05) increase of serum COMP levels 30 minutes after impact loading compared to the impact loading under artificial gravity (RUN +30%, EGJ +20%, AGJ +17% and SJS +13% compared to baseline). In conclusion, both the amplitude and the number of impacts contribute to inducing higher COMP responses and are therefore likely important factors affecting cartilage metabolism. RUN had the largest effect on serum COMP concentration, presumably due to the high number of impacts, which was ten times higher than for the jump modalities. Future studies should aim at establishing a dose-response relationship for different types of exercise using comparable amounts of impacts."

However, only a few studies have identified swimming ability classifiers in preschool children. This pilot cross-sectional study aimed to find anthropometric (AM) and motor competence (MC) predictors of swimming ability in preschool children, by building classifiers of swimming ability group (SAG) membership. We recruited 92 children (girls n = 45) aged 5–6 years and took the AM and MC measurements in accordance with the reference manual and using the KTK battery test (motor quotient, MQ), respectively. A linear discriminant analysis tested a classification model of preschoolers’ swimming ability (SAG: POOR, GOOD, EXCELLENT) based on gender, age, AM, and MC variables and extracted one significant canonical discriminant function (model fit: 61.2%) that can differentiate (group centroids) POOR (−1.507), GOOD (0.032), and EXCELLENT (1.524). The MQ total was identified as a significant classifier, which absolutely contributed to the discriminant function that classifies children’s swimming ability as POOR (standardized canonical coefficient: 1.186), GOOD (1.363), or EXCELLENT (1.535) with an accuracy of 64.1%. Children with higher MQ total ought to be classified into higher SAG; thus, the classification model of SAG based on the MQ total is presented."

To determine injury rates and characteristics for players participating in U.S. Rugby-7s U19 (under 19 years of age) tournaments. Injury data were collected, using the Rugby Injury Survey & Evaluation report methodology, at 24 U.S. Rugby-7 s U19 tournaments over 30 tournament days (2010-2014). Tournament medical-attention injuries and time-loss injuries (days absent before return to training/competition including post tournament) were recorded. During the 2101 playing hours (3072 males, aged 17.2 ± 1.5 years; 732 females, 16.6 ± 1.3 years of age), there were 173 tournament injuries with an overall injury incidence of 82.4/1000 player-match-hours (ph) (CI 70.5-95.6). Acute injuries (79.5/1000 ph) occurred during tackling (56.2/1000 ph) and involved joints/ligaments (32.8/1000 ph) of lower extremities (31.9/1000 ph). Head and neck injuries, including concussions, were common (males 21.9/1000 ph; females 22.0/1000 ph). Medical-attention injury incidences (49.5/1000 ph; n = 104; 95% CI 40.5-60.0) were higher than time loss (32.8/1000 ph; n = 69; 95% CI 25.5-41.6). Overall, injury incidences found no difference between sex (RR 0.78; p = 0.369). Time-loss injuries resulted in an average of 35.5 d to return to sport. This study is the first to report match injury incidences for U19 participants in Rugby-7s. Overall, match injury incidence among U.S. U19 Rugby-7s tournaments was similar compared to adult U.S. community Rugby-7s. Recurrent injury risk was notable in this population. Community injury surveillance studies are essential to understand risk from participation in amateur sports. Knowledge of these injury patterns in U19 Rugby-7s will help identify areas to direct resources to enable growth of Rugby-7s in youths and emerging countries being exposed to Rugby-7 s. Age-based injury frequency and patterns in rugby and its various formats are needed for the development of evidence-based, sport-specific, and population-specific injury prevention initiatives. The match injury incidence of U19 participants in U.S. Rugby-7s was similar to the incidence among adult participants. Recurrent match injury risk was high at 23%. There were no significant differences in injury incidences between males and females. The first three matches of a tournament day result in the most injuries."

There is a need to understand the comparison of asymmetries between open and closed skill tasks. The study investigated inter-limb step asymmetry responses to closed and open skill acceleration sprint running tasks. Methods 3D motion analysis kinematic data of step characteristics were collected from 20 male soccer players (mean ± SD: 21 ± 1.9 years, 78.7 ± 7.7 kg, 1.78 ± 0.06 m) for bilaterally located lower-limb markers during the initial 20 m of closed and open skill acceleration sprint running trials. Step velocity, step length, step frequency, flight time, contact time, and flight distance were calculated. In the closed skill conditions, players knew the final sprint distance before initiation. In the open skill conditions, players were informed of the final sprint distance (20 or 40 m) immediately after run initiation. Results Significant asymmetries (0.10–10.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in step characteristics were observed during closed skill acceleration sprint performances. Positive correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;: 0.51–0.77, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were evidenced between asymmetry scores in the closed skill and in the open skill 20-m and 40-m conditions. Asymmetry scores were not associated with sprint performance (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;: from –0.13 to 0.30, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05), suggesting that asymmetry may be functional or dysfunctional. Conclusions Skilled soccer players can regulate step characteristic asymmetries across closed and open skill tasks. Symmetry should not be assumed when assessing open and closed skill acceleration sprint performance in soccer players. Practitioners should be aware of these asymmetries when implementing programmes."

The first choice in therapeutic treatment is conservative therapy. The objective of this study is to provide a systematic review regarding conservative treatment for longstanding adductor-related groin pain syndrome present in literature today. Furthermore, this study aims to give a critical vision of the current state of the art of the considered topic. After screening 234 articles, 19 studies following the inclusion criteria were included and summarized in this current systematic review and seven different types of therapeutic interventions were described. Compression clothing therapy, manual therapy together with strengthening exercise and prolotherapy were the therapeutic interventions which showed both the greatest level of strength of evidence (Moderate) and grade of recommendation (D). The remaining four types of therapeutic interventions i.e.: corticoid injection, platelet rich plasma therapy, intra-tissue percutaneous electrolysis and pulse-dose radiofrequency, showed both lower levels of strength of evidence (Conflicting) and grade of recommendation (C). In conclusion the literature available on the conservative treatment for longstanding adductor-related groin pain syndrome is limited and characterized by a low level of evidence. Therefore, our recommendation is to refer only to the few studies with higher level of evidence and at the same time to encourage further research in this area. The intervention showing the greater level of strength of evidence, and the greater grade of recommendation are compression clothing therapy, manual therapy and strengthening exercise, and prolotherapy. Other therapeutic interventions such as intra-tissue percutaneous electrolysis and pulse-dose radiofrequency seem promising but require further studies to confirm their efficacy."

Most studies used movement tasks with low translational or rotational loads and did not provide joint kinematics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of two different knee braces (rigid vs. soft) on knee joint kinematics in ACL-deficient patients compared to an unbraced control condition using two tasks (walking and 180° cutting) provoking knee movements in the frontal and transverse planes. 17 subjects with ACL-deficient knees participated in this study. 3D knee joint kinematics were recorded. To provoke frontal plane knee joint motion a laterally tilting plate was applied during a walking task. Both braces reduced the maximum valgus angle compared to the unbraced condition, stabilizing the knee joint against excessive valgus motion. Yet, no differences in peak abduction angle between the two braces were found. However, a significant extension deficit was observed with the rigid brace. Moreover, both braces increased transverse plane RoM and peak internal rotation angle, with the effects being significantly larger with the rigid brace. These effects have been associated with decreased knee stability and unphysiological cartilage loading. Therefore, the soft brace seems to be able to limit peak abduction with a lesser impact on physiological gait compared to the rigid brace. The cutting task was selected to provoke transverse plane knee movement and large external knee rotation was expected. However, none of the braces was able to reduce peak external knee rotation. Again, an increase in transverse plane RoM was observed with both braces. Based on these results, no brace outmatched the other in the second task. This study was the first attempt to clarify the effect of brace design for the stabilization of the knee joint during movements with frontal and transverse plane loading. However, to provide physicians and patients with a comprehensive guideline for brace usage, future studies will have to extent these findings to other daily or sportive movement tasks."

The latter was the result of aggressive mechanical mixing of diamine curative, isocyanate, and deionized water at ambient conditions, which can be adjusted on-demand to produce variable density polyurea foam. The spherical, semi-closed microcellular structure has large perforations on the cell surface resulting from the concurrent expansion of neighboring cells and small holes at the bottom surface of the cells. This resulted in a partially perforated microcellular structure of polyurea foam. As a byproduct of the manufacturing process, polyurea microspheres nucleate and deposit on the inner cell walls of the foam, acting as a reinforcement. Since cell walls and the microspheres are made of polyurea, the resulting reinforcement effect overcomes the fundamental interfacial issue of different adjacent materials. The partially perforated, self-reinforced polyurea foam is compared to the performance of traditional counterparts in biomechanical impact scenarios. An analytical model was developed to explicate the stiffening effect associated with the reinforcing microspheres. The model results indicate that the reinforced microcell exhibited, on average, ~30% higher stiffness than its barren counterpart."

On positive gradient, the ability to store and release elastic energy is impaired in forward running. We studied running on level and on gradient to test the hypothesis that the higher metabolic cost and lower efficiency in backward than forward running was due to the impairment in the elastic energy utilisation.Eight subjects ran forward and backward on a treadmill on level and on gradient (from 0 to + 25%, with 5% step). The mechanical work, computed from kinematic data, C and efficiency (the ratio between total mechanical work and C) were calculated in each condition.Backward running C was higher than forward running at each condition (on average + 35%) and increased linearly with gradient. Total mechanical work was higher in forward running only at the steepest gradients, thus efficiency was lower in backward running at each gradient.Efficiency decreased by increasing gradient in both running modalities highlighting the impairment in the elastic contribution on positive gradient. The lower efficiency values calculated in backward running in all conditions pointed out that backward running was performed with an almost inelastic rebound; thus, muscles performed most of the mechanical work with a high metabolic cost. These new backward running C data permit, by applying the recently introduced 'equivalent slope' concept for running acceleration, to obtain the predictive equation of metabolic power during level backward running acceleration."

Age- and sex-related changes in landing and bouncing mechanisms in youth soccer players are still under investigated. This study characterizes knee biomechanics in a large cohort of élite academy players, stratified by sex and age group. A sample of 189 young soccer players (132 male U10-U12 and U14-U17, 57 females U10-U14) from the Academy of a professional “Serie A” Italian club were tested. Motion capture technology was used to obtain sagittal and frontal plane knee angles, as well as VDJ landing asymmetry and peak vertical ground reaction forces at push-off. Landing kinetics and kinematics changed as a function of age and sex in youth élite soccer players: (i) males and females showed different landing load asymmetry between dominant and non-dominant leg, peak push-off force and knee flexion even before puberty, (ii) landing asymmetry tended to reduce in older players and (iii) knee varus increased in males after adolescence. In conclusion, besides its role in injury prevention, the VDJ can help in monitoring players’ growth and development, and this process should start at an early age. This data collection could be used as a tool for further screening test to highlight anomalous landing behaviour."

This condition encompasses almost one third of sports-related injuries and has severe consequences, such as pain and weakness of the muscles. This injury is related namely to quick and demanding activities, such as short distance sprinting in a limited time period. The Common Origin Tendon (COT) for these two muscles is affected in these injuries. This tendon is formed by the BFlh and ST muscles which together have a common origin in the ischial tuberosity. Given the lack of complete knowledge about the detailed structure of the COT, we dissected cadaveric limbs, describing their morphological characteristics, and discussing its functional and clinical implications.: Thirty-five human cadaveric lower limbs were dissected after fixation to analyze the morphology of the COT, focusing on their volume and muscular/tendinous proportion. We identified two subtypes of COT. The most frequent was the musculotendinous type, in which the origin of the BFlh was mainly tendinous, while the ST muscle was mainly muscular (91.4%). In the tendinous type both muscles had a tendinous origin (8.6%). In the musculotendinous type, the ST muscle ends with a microscopic connective tissue that extend into the ischial tuberosity. We conclude that there is a variability in the anatomical presentations of the COT, and we propose that this will correspond with biomechanical differences in the risks and the response to regional injuries. The connective tissue between the COT and the neighbouring structures could be a risk factor for adhesion tearing."

A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies,2020-08-20,2020,review,"Abstract Background To systematically review the association between knee abduction kinematics and kinetics during weight-bearing activities at baseline and the risk of future anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. A search in the databases MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, EMBASE and Scopus was performed. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies including people of any age, assessing baseline knee abduction kinematics and/or kinetics during any weight-bearing activity for the lower extremity in individuals sustaining a future ACL injury and in those who did not. Results Nine articles were included in this review. Neither 3D knee abduction angle at initial contact (Mean diff: -1.68, 95%CI: − 4.49 to 1.14, ACL injury n = 66, controls n = 1369), peak 3D knee abduction angle (Mean diff: -2.17, 95%CI: − 7.22 to 2.89, ACL injury n = 25, controls n = 563), 2D peak knee abduction angle (Mean diff: -3.25, 95%CI: − 9.86 to 3.36, ACL injury n = 8, controls n = 302), 2D medial knee displacement (cm; Mean diff:: -0.19, 95%CI: − 0,96 to 0.38, ACL injury n = 72, controls n = 967) or peak knee abduction moment (Mean diff:-10.61, 95%CI: - 26.73 to 5.50, ACL injury n = 54, controls n = 1330) predicted future ACL injury. Conclusion Contrary to clinical opinion, our findings indicate that knee abduction kinematics and kinetics during weight-bearing activities may not be risk factors for future ACL injury. Knee abduction of greater magnitude than that observed in the included studies as well as factors other than knee abduction angle or moment, as possible screening measures for knee injury risk should be evaluated in future studies."

This study sought to relate the proposed youth standard-defined laboratory impacts to on-field head impacts collected from youth football players. Head impact data from 112 youth football players (ages 9–14) were collected through the use of helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays. These head impacts were filtered to only include those that resided in corridors near prescribed National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) impact locations. Peak linear head acceleration and peak rotational head acceleration magnitudes collected from pneumatic ram impactor tests as specified by the proposed NOCSAE youth standard were compared to the distribution of on-field head impacts. All laboratory impact tests were among the top 10% in terms of magnitude for Severity Index and peak rotational acceleration of matched location head impacts experienced by youth football players. As concussive head impacts are among the most severe impacts experienced on the field, a safety standard geared toward mitigating concussion should assess the most severe on-field head impacts. This proposed testing standard may be refined as more becomes known regarding the biomechanics of concussion among youth athletes."

Impact of pain on athlete availability, training and performance can be mitigated when key epidemiological information is used to inform adequate pain management strategies. This study aims to 1) provide an epidemiological profile of self-reported pain experienced by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes by sex during the first half of the 2019 season, 2) describe their self-reported non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Methods Online survey was completed by athletes at three NCAA institutions from 1 August to 30 September 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data, self-reported pain and self-reported NSAID use. Pain incidence proportion were calculated. Results Two hundred thirty female athletes and 83 male athletes completed the survey. Self-reported pain incidence proportion for female athletes was 45.0 (95% CI 41.5–48.5) vs 34.9 (95% CI 29.4–40.4) for male athletes. Majority of the athletes did not report pain (55% female vs 62% male) during the first half of the 2019 season. Female athletes reported pain in their back (35%), knee (26%), and ankle/foot (23%) whilst male athletes reported pain in their knee (35%), back (28%), and shoulder (24%). Of all athletes, 28% female vs 20% male athletes reported currently taking NSAIDs. Of athletes that reported pain, 46% female vs 38% male athletes currently took NSAIDs. 70% female vs 61% male athletes self-purchased NSAIDs, and 40% female vs 55% male athletes consumed alcohol. Conclusions Half of female athletes and one in three male athletes reported pain. Most commonly back, knee and foot/ankle pain and knee, back and shoulder pain was reported in female and male athletes respectively. One in four female athletes and one in five male athletes use NSAIDs for pain or prophylactic purpose. Majority self-purchase these medications indicating need for health literacy interventions to mitigate potential adverse effects."

However, the mechanism of this observation is unknown. We conducted a systematic review examining the association between 1) the biomechanical and functional safety of unplanned sports-related movements (e.g. jumps/runs with spontaneously indicated landing leg/cutting direction) and 2) markers of perceptual-cognitive function (PGF). A literature search in three databases (Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar) identified five relevant articles. Study quality, rated by means of a modified Downs &amp;amp; Black checklist, was moderate to high (average: 13.5/16 points). Four of five papers, in at least one parameter, found either an association of lower PGF and reduced task safety or significantly reduced task safety in low vs. high PGF performers. Yet, as a) the outcomes, populations and statistical methods of the included trials were highly heterogeneous and b) only two out of five studies had an adequate control condition (pre-planned movement task), evidence was classified as conflicting. In sum, PGF may represent a factor increasing injury risk during unplanned sports-related movements but future research strengthening the evidence of this association is warranted."

Although chiropractors can claim some penetration as health care service providers in high level sport, their position as valued members of interprofessional health care teams, especially those built around traditional medical organisational structures, is unclear. As a first step to map the professional practice landscape of Danish sports chiropractors, this investigation sought to explore the perceived role and value of chiropractors as service providers in elite Danish football clubs. Methods: A comparative qualitative case study using semi-structured individual interviews was conducted. Six Danish Superliga clubs were purposively sampled to compare and contrast instances where chiropractors were absent from the health care team, contracted as in-house health care team members or engaged as external service providers. Triangulated responses were solicited from healthcare co-ordinators, chiropractors and athletes within each club’s organisation through short semi-structured individual interviews. The audio-recorded responses were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using a framework approach. Results: Inductive and deductive coding revealed 14 unique codes, which were further organised into 4 code families relating to the role of chiropractors, benefits of utilizing chiropractic care and facilitators and barriers to interprofessional practice. From this framework 3 themes were abstracted, these being: “Broadening horizons”, “In-house preferred to take-away” and “Already covered, or even necessary?”. Conclusion: In this practice context, chiropractors fill the role of musculoskeletal health care service providers. Their perceived value stems from additional expert disciplinary knowledge, improved diagnostic triage and increased treatment flexibility. However, where not utilized, the role of the spinal health expert is questioned and when acknowledged, limited to that of a technician/therapist. It is unclear whether chiropractors can claim core team member status. Further exploration of this interesting context of interprofessional practice is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3053611472,Traumatic and non-traumatic bone marrow edema in ankle MRI: a pictorial essay,2020-08-17,2020,review,"Bone marrow edema (BME) is one of the most common findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after an ankle injury but can be present even without a history of trauma. This article will provide a systematic overview of the most common disorders in the ankle and foot associated with BME.The presence of BME is an unspecific but sensitive sign of primary pathology and may act as a guide to correct and systematic interpretation of the MR examination. The distribution of BME allows for a determination of the trauma mechanism and a correct assessment of soft tissue injury. The BME pattern following an inversion injury involves the lateral malleolus, the medial part of the talar body, and the medial part of the distal tibia. In other cases, a consideration of the distribution of BME may indicate the mechanism of injury or impingement. Bone in direct contact with a tendon may lead to alterations in the bone marrow signal where BME may indicate tendinopathy or dynamic tendon dysfunction. Changed mechanical forces between bones in coalition may lead to BME. Degenerative changes or minor cartilage damage may lead to subchondral BME. Early avascular necrosis, inflammation, or stress fracture may lead to more diffuse BME; therefore, a detailed medical history is crucial for correct diagnosis.A systematic analysis of BME on MRI can help to determine the trauma mechanism and thus assess soft tissue injuries and help to differentiate between different etiologies of nontraumatic BME."

Data Sources: Systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed) for all years, using search combinations to best identify potential publications. Manuscripts were reviewed, summarized, and discussed in detail. Experienced clinicians in sports medicine and pediatric obesity reviewed the final searches for substantive content. Inclusion criteria include English language publications, children ≤18 years old, related to the practice of sports medicine and pediatric obesity. Publications excluded that dealt with non-sports medicine aspects of pediatric obesity, such as increasing physical activity or exercise, or the prevention or treatment of obesity. Main Results: Twenty-eight publications were included for review. Papers fell into 5 groupings: (1) MSK—increased incidence of MSK injury in children with obesity, hypothesized to be a result of changes in biomechanics; (2) weight management—gradual loss while maintaining proper hydration and nutrition for sports performance; (3) fitness/conditioning—children with overweight/obese showed decreased fitness measures and cardiopulmonary conditioning; (4) exertional heat illness—a concern for adolescent athletes with obesity, specifically in football; and (5) differential diagnoses—3 key differential diagnoses were identified for increased awareness: slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Blount's disease, and pes planus. Clinical topics pertinent to sports medicine and pediatric obesity were discussed. Conclusions: Sports medicine clinicians should be aware of the common MSK and sports-related conditions in children with obesity. Few studies have focused investigations on issues related to children with obesity participating in sports and other physical activities."

Research has observed the relationship between lower-extremity musculoskeletal injury and baseline neurocognitive performance; however, the understanding of this relationship is lacking. Exploring this relationship may give further insight into musculoskeletal injury and provide innovative directions for musculoskeletal injury prevention. Clinical Question: Is there a relationship between neurocognitive performance and lower-extremity biomechanics during a jumping or cutting task in healthy adult athletes? Summary of Key Findings: The literature was searched for articles that examined the relationship of a baseline neurocognitive test and a biomechanical analysis following a sports-related task. A total of 3 cross-sectional articles were included. All 3 studies concluded that poorer neurocognitive performance was associated with biomechanical faults that are linked to increased risk or rate of lower-extremity musculoskeletal injury. Clinical Bottom Line: Based on the evidence included, there is a moderate-level evidence to support the relationship between neurocognition and lower-extremity biomechanics in healthy adult athletes. Strength of Recommendation: In accordance with the van Tulder approach, there is a moderate level of evidence due to consistent findings from a combination of high- and limited-quality articles."

Studies have suggested that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may play a role in improving sleep quality. Objective To investigate how OMT may play a role in the management and overall healing process in patients with a concussion by improving sleep quality. Methods Data were collected from a randomized, controlled study on OMT and concussion (of which this study represents 1 arm) to investigate the effects of OMT vs concussion education counseling on sleep quality in student athletes with a concussion. Student athletes with no medical history of neurodegenerative disease who presented to the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine Academic Healthcare Center with a concussion following a sport-related injury were enrolled in the study. Participants received OMT intervention or standard counseling on how to care for a concussion during their first and second visits. Participants rated their symptoms, including sleep quality, on the validated scale Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5th Edition at 3 consecutive visits during 1 week. The mean sleep quality score within and between the OMT and education groups before each of 2 interventions and at the third visit were compared and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Thirty participants were enrolled in the study. Total symptom data showed a stronger, significant correlation with sleep scores than with other symptoms. Participants receiving OMT (n=16) reported overall 80% and 76% improvement in sleep quality from pre-OMT values to their second and third visits, respectively. Participants who had an educational intervention (n=14) reported a 36% and 46% improvement from pre-OMT values to their second and third visits, respectively. Conclusion The beneficial relationship trend between OMT and sleep quality in patients with a concussion was not statistically significant. Owing to the limitations of this study, further research with a larger population and sham control participants is warranted. (Clinicaltrials.gov No. NCT02750566)"

The dominant side of the hand for pitching or batting was correlated with the contralateral-side lesions in baseball players (p = 0.001).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The distribution of the lesions of spondylolysis differed in young soccer and baseball players. Pitching or batting with the dominant-side hand would be associated with contralateral-side lesions in baseball players. Sports-specific movements and the side of the dominant leg should be considered when treating young athletes with symptomatic spondylolysis."

Hoverboards are to them like a game or a mean of transport, but they could be used as a valid and useful instrument in children’s training programs to improve their performance. In this study, we compared the athletic performance of two groups of 12 children. A total of 24 children aged between 8 and 11 years followed a similar training program for five months, but the first group used a hoverboard (Hb+ group: Age: Standard Deviation (SD) = 1.15 Mean = 9.66; Weight: SD = 5.90 Mean = 32; Height: SD = 7.64 Mean = 135.08) for some of the training time, differently from the second group (Hb- group: Age: SD = 1.15 Mean = 9.66; Weight: SD = 5.82 Mean = 31.16; Height: SD = 7.66 Mean = 136.16), which never used it. All of the children were asked to complete three tests (one leg test, stork test and balance beam walking test) before starting their own training program and after five months, to evaluate how their performances changed in terms of time. Comparing the recorded time difference between T0 and T1 of the Hb+ group with the same difference measured in Hb- group, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference (p value &lt; 0.05) between these data for all three tests. Children who used the hoverboard in their training program achieved better result than children who did not use it. In the future, the hoverboard could help athletes to improve their performances, possibly applying it not only in football training, but even in other sports."

Data were sourced from the National male younger age competition (YAC; Under-17; n=237) and older-age competition (OAC; Under-19; n=302), as well as female younger age competition (YAC; Under-15; n=234) and older-age competition (OAC; Under-18; n=260) over a four year period. Left-hand dominant (LHD) batters were consistently overrepresented in the male YAC (Right: 69.2%; Left: 30.8%) and OAC (Right: 68.2%; Left: 31.8%) compared with the expected general population distribution. Male LHD batters exhibited a significantly (p<0.05) higher batting aggregate (YAC: 116.82 ±84.75 vs. 137.84 ±89.74; OAC: 117.07 ±89.00 vs. 146.28 ±95.99), scored more runs (YAC: 19.65 ±12.32 vs. 23.96 ±14.71; OAC: 19.27 ±12.61 vs. 23.98 ±14.15), spent more time batting (YAC: 45.33 ±25.89mins vs. 54.59 ±28.62mins; OAC: 39.80 ±21.79mins vs. 49.33 ±27.41mins), and scored more boundary-4s per game (YAC: 1.83 ±1.40 vs. 2.44 ±1.87; OAC: 1.76 ±1.32 vs. 2.19 ±1.83), across both YAC and OAC groups with small effects sizes. No overrepresentation was present for either female group (YAC, Right: 88.5%/ Left: 11.5%; OAC, Right: 90.0%/ Left: 10.0%). Female LHD batters exhibited significantly higher batting aggregate (68.97 ±53.17 vs. 102.96 ±73.48), batting average (13.24 ±10.88 vs. 17.75 ±12.28), and spent more time batting per game (25.52 ±15.08mins vs. 37.75 ±26.76mins); however, only at the OAC level with small-moderate effects sizes. Finally, there were few performance advantages identified to batting with a reverse stance, with further work needed to clarify any potential biomechanical benefits. Team selection practices may exploit the left-handed advantage by over-selecting talented left-handed junior cricketers. Practical implications for coaches include creating practice environments that negate the negative frequency-dependent selection, such as providing more practice opportunities for their players against left-handed opponents."

https://openalex.org/W3047276944,Classifying Elite From Novice Athletes Using Simulated Wearable Sensor Data,2020-08-04,2020,article,"Movement screens are frequently used to identify differences in movement patterns such as pathological abnormalities or skill related differences in sport; however, abnormalities are often visually detected by a human assessor resulting in poor reliability. Therefore, our previous research has focused on the development of an objective movement assessment tool to classify elite and novice athletes' kinematic data using machine learning algorithms. Classifying elite and novice athletes can be beneficial to objectively detect differences in movement patterns between the athletes, which can then be used to provide higher quality feedback to athletes and their coaches. Currently, the method requires optical motion capture, which is expensive and time-consuming to use, creating a barrier for adoption within industry. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether machine learning could classify athletes as elite or novice using data that can be collected easily and inexpensively in the field using inertial measurement units (IMUs). A secondary purpose of this study was to refine the architecture of the tool to optimize classification rates. Motion capture data from 542 athletes performing seven dynamic screening movements were analyzed. A principal component analysis (PCA)-based pattern recognition technique and machine learning algorithms with the Euclidean norm of the segment linear accelerations and angular velocities as inputs were used to classify athletes based on skill level. Depending on the movement, using metrics achievable with IMUs and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA), 75.1-84.7% of athletes were accurately classified as elite or novice. We have provided evidence that suggests our objective, data-driven method can detect meaningful differences during a movement screening battery when using data that can be collected using IMUs, thus providing a large methodological advance as these can be collected in the field using sensors. This method offers an objective, inexpensive tool that can be easily implemented in the field to potentially enhance screening, assessment, and rehabilitation in sport and clinical settings."

https://openalex.org/W3082023561,Musculoskeletal pain is common in competitive gaming: a cross-sectional study among Danish esports athletes,2020-08-01,2020,article,"Objectives The interest for competitive esports is growing. Little is known regarding musculoskeletal (MSK) pain among esports athletes. We aimed to investigate (1) the prevalence of MSK pain, (2) the association between MSK pain and esports-related training volume and (3) the association between MSK pain and physical activity levels. Methods Athletes aged 15-35 years who participated in structured esports through a computer-based game were eligible for inclusion. Participant demographics, hours/week spent on esports, self-report MSK pain sites, pain frequency, sleep, care-seeking behaviour and physical activity levels were collected through online questionnaires. The primary outcome was any MSK pain in the body during the previous week. Results Of 188 included athletes, 42.6% reported MSK pain. The most common pain site was the back (31.3%). Athletes with MSK pain participated in significantly less esports training compared with athletes without MSK pain (mean difference -5.6 hours/week; 95% CI -10.6 to -0.7, p=0.035). There was no significant difference in physical activity levels between groups (mean difference 81.1 metabolic equivalent of task-minutes/week; 95% CI -1266.9 to 1429.1, p=0.906). Conclusion Back pain is common among esports athletes. Athletes with MSK pain participated in less esports training compared with those without pain, suggesting a potentially negative effect of pain on esports participation."

Reactive balance training (RBT) aims to improve control of reactions to prevent falling after a loss of balance. In healthy older adults, a single RBT session can lead to lasting improvements in reactive balance control and prevent falls in daily life. While increasing the dose of RBT does not appear to lead to additional benefit for healthy older adults, stroke survivors, who have more severely impaired balance control, may benefit from a higher RBT dose. Our long-term goal is to determine the optimal dose of RBT in people with subacute stroke. This assessor-blinded pilot randomised controlled trial aims to inform the design of a larger trial to address this long-term goal. Methods and analysis Participants (n=36) will be attending out-patient stroke rehabilitation, and will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: one, three or six RBT sessions. RBT will replace a portion of participants’ regular physiotherapy so that the total physical rehabilitation time will be the same for the three groups. Balance and balance confidence will be assessed at: (1) study enrolment; (2) out-patient rehabilitation discharge; and (3) 6 months postdischarge. Participants will report falls and physical activity for 6 months postdischarge. Pilot data will be used to plan the larger trial (ie, sample size estimate using fall rates, and which groups should be included based on between-group trends in pre-to-post training effect sizes for reactive balance control measures). Pilot data will also be used to assess the feasibility of the larger trial (ie, based on the accrual rate, outcome completion rate and feasibility of prescribing specific training doses). Ethics and dissemination Institutional research ethics approval has been received. Study participants will receive a lay summary of results. We will also publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration number NCT04219696 ; Pre results."
https://openalex.org/W3047304875,Painful Flatfoot in Children and Adolescents: They're Not All the Same,2020-08-01,2020,article,"Pediatric flatfoot is ubiquitous with several etiologies, including that of being the normal shape of the child’s foot. More specifically, pediatric flatfoot can be categorized as either flexible or rigid, with the former being more common. Most flexible flatfeet are normal and do not cause pain or functional disability. They should not, in fact, be called deformities at all but, instead, anatomic shape variations. Rigid flatfeet are acquired deformities. Most are caused by tarsal coalitions which, like their flexible counterparts, are also usually asymptomatic. This fact contributes to their under-diagnosis in the general population and makes it imperative to consider the coexistence of a tarsal coalition in a child with foot pain in the setting of flatfoot. There are several etiologies for pain in pediatric feet that happen to be flat, including the association of a tendo-Achilles contracture, the aforementioned tarsal coalitions, muscle overuse in young children, inflammatory arthropathies, accessory naviculars, stress fractures, foreign bodies, infections, tumors, and chronic pain syndromes. They must be identified as such so that specific and targeted treatment can be instituted. Surgical management of symptomatic flatfoot, after failed non-operative treatment, is based on the utilization of osteotomies to correct the anatomic deformities. If the symptomatic flatfoot is associated with a tarsal coalition, surgical treatment may involve resection of the coalition with concurrent or staged deformity correction, or deformity correction alone. In the majority of cases, gastrocnemius recession or tendo-Achilles lengthening is required. Addressing other coincident deformities with the addition of concurrent osteotomies and soft tissue procedures are needed to ensure short and long-term success."

Causative mutations in the fibrillin-1 protein lead to dysregulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). A diagnosis of MFS can be made using systemic evaluation combining clinical and genetic features. Because the condition is characterized by a variety of musculoskeletal manifestations, orthopaedic surgeons may be the first provider patients encounter. Common musculoskeletal manifestations of MFS include spine deformity, acetabular protrusion, limb length deformity, joint laxity, and foot pathology. Non-musculoskeletal manifestations include major cardiac and ocular conditions. Early identification is important for referral and prompt treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities, which can prevent premature mortality. As medical and surgical interventions have advanced, life expectancy for MFS patients has increased to late 70s. We must remain vigilant, suspect diagnosis, and engage in multidisciplinary care to promote musculoskeletal function at advanced ages."

https://openalex.org/W3088336687,Countermovement Jump Assessment for Monitoring Prolonged Fatigue in Collegiate Female Soccer Players,2020-08-01,2020,dissertation,"<bold>Introduction: </bold>Females are 4 to 6 times more likely to sustain an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury than their male counterparts during running and cutting sports, such as soccer. This sex disparity is thought to result from altered lower limb neuromuscular control that females present when fatigued at the end of practice or games. Yet, current fatigue monitoring techniques typically vary in their reliability, applicability and efficiency. <bold>Purpose: </bold>The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of the countermovement jump (CMJ) to quickly and reliably monitor fatigue in female soccer athletes. <bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-two (age: 19.3 ± 1.1 yrs, ht: 1.7 ± 7.2 m, and wt: 61.9 ± 7.7 kg) females from an NCAA Division I soccer team had peak isokinetic strength and power and specific ground reaction metrics of a CMJ including: peak and rate of force/power development, impulse, and reactive strength index modified, quantified immediately before off-season training, and immediately prior to- and following the completion of the competitive season. <bold>Results:</bold> Quadriceps and hamstrings peak torque and average power increased following the competitive season for both limbs compared to pre-season and pre-training time points (all: p &lt; 0.05). During the CMJ, maximum rate of power production and peak force were greater at the post-season compared to pre-training (p = 0.023 and p = 0.007, respectively) and pre-season (p = 0.024 and p = 0.044, respectively) time points, while peak power was greater at post-season compared to the pre-training (p = 0.018) time point. Changes in relative net impulse, peak power, peak landing force, and jump height during the CMJ demonstrated moderate to strong relations to changes in isokinetic variables from pre-training to post-season (all: p &lt; 0.05, r &gt; 0.4). Lastly, the same CMJ measures accurately identified 96% of starters (Eigenvalue = 2.147, p = 0.038) and 86% of first-year athletes, although the classification of first-year athletes was not statistically different than non-first-year athletes (Eigenvalue = 1.279, p = 0.173). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The current research identifies the CMJ task as a promising tool for athletic trainers and sports performance coaches to reliably monitor female soccer performance in general, and training loads specifically. Immediately following the competitive season, the current athletes increased isokinetic strength and power as well as CMJ performance, with changes in CMJ performance exhibiting a significant relation to changes in isokinetic strength and power. Yet, following off-season training, where isokinetic strength and power declined, albeit insignificantly, a similar relation between changes in CMJ performance and isokinetic strength and power was not observed. The experimental outcomes may indicate that the CMJ task is better suited for identifying increases in strength and power rather than decrements and fatigue. These same CMJ measures may serve as an effective tool for identifying improved strength and power, and performance differences for specific members of a collegiate soccer team, as 96% of starters and 86% of first-year athletes were accurately identified."

Materials and Methods We used peripheral quantitative computed tomography to quantify right femoral and tibial J and soft tissue cross‐sectional areas, and force plate mechanography to quantify peak power output and maximum force of the right limb, among athletic women and control subjects. Results Lower limb bone J exhibited strong relationships with estimated force but not power between both groups. Among controls, the strongest relationships between force and J were found at the midshaft femur. Among athletes, these relationships shifted to the tibia, regardless of body size, likely reflecting functional strain related to the major knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors. Together, muscle force and stature explained as much as 82 and 48% of the variance in lower limb bone J among controls and athletes, respectively. Discussion Results highlight the importance of considering relevant muscle function variables (e.g., force and lever arm lengths) when interpreting behavioral signatures from skeletal remains. Future work to improve the estimation of muscle force from skeletal remains, and incorporate it with lever arm length into analyses, is warranted. Results also suggest that, in doing so, functional relationships between a given section location and musculature should be considered."

The participants were filmed during a typical training session while they were equipped with a heart rate sensor. The sessions were systematically recorded to allow for detailed analyses. Furthermore, a preliminary and explorative analysis of the influence of the level of play on these results was conducted. The overall findings indicated that training included 33.4% playing forms, 29.5% training forms, 28.4% inactivity time and 8.7% athletics. The highest heart rates were achieved in the playing forms (166 min-1, 83% HRmax) compared to the other two activities (training forms 154 min-1, 77% HRmax; athletics 150 min-1, 75% HRmax). Each player had 12.8 duels and 0.6 headers per training. Overall most duels were conducted from anterior direction. Playing forms induce higher cardio-circulatory load as well as a better learning environment. Potentially dangerous situations like contact with other players or headers occurred in a single player on average every 6 minutes during a training session."

The Center for Disease Control estimates that up to 3.8 million sport-related mTBI are reported each year in the US. Despite the magnitude of the phenomenon, there is a current lack of comprehensive prognostic indicators and research has shown that available monitoring tools are moderately sensitive to short-term concussion effects but less sensitive to long-term consequences. The overall aim of this review is to discuss novel, quantitative, and objective measurements that can predict long-term outcomes following repeated sports-related mTBIs. The specific objectives were 1) to provide an overview of the current clinical and biomechanical tools available to health practitioners to ensure recovery after mTBIs, 2) to synthesize potential biological mechanisms in animal models underlying the long-term adverse consequences of mTBIs, 3) to discuss the possible link between repeated mTBI and neurodegenerative diseases and, 4) to discuss the current knowledge about fluid biomarkers for mTBIs with a focus on novel exosomal biomarkers. The conclusions from this review are that current post-concussion clinical tests are not sufficiently sensitive to injury and do not accurately quantify post-concussion alterations associated with repeated mTBIs. In the current review, it is proposed that current practices should be amended to include a repeated symptom inventory, a cognitive assessment of executive function and impulse control, an instrumented assessment of balance, vestibulo-ocular assessments and an improved panel of blood or exosome biomarkers."

Inclusion criteria included patients between 18 and 50 years of age who had participated in recreational sports prior to surgery and had a minimum of a 2-year follow-up. Labral injury was evaluated using the Multicenter Arthroscopic Hip Outcome Research Network classification, and rim chondral injuries were evaluated using the Acetabular Labral Articular Disruptions system. Ligamentum teres tear and psoas impingement were also recorded. Sports were classified as rotational running (soccer, basketball, handball), flexibility (martial arts, dance), asymmetric-overhead (racquet), or endurance (running, swimming, cycling). Primary univariate analysis of sports' independent associations, demographic characteristics, intra-articular hip injuries, and outcomes was performed.Patients included 185 people with a mean age of 36.7 years. Patients participating in rotational running sports and flexibility sports had a significantly greater proportion of rim chondral injuries than those participating in endurance sports or asymmetric overhead sports (P = 0.02). Ligamentum teres tears were significantly associated with flexibility sports (P < 0.001).

Pelvic torsion, possibly caused by muscular imbalances, is discussed as a pathogenic mechanism. This study examined a possible interrelationship between the maximum torques of quadriceps femoris and hamstrings and the spatial positioning of the hemi-pelvises, as well as the tenderness to palpation of the pubic symphysis. The three-dimensional pelvic contour of 26 pain free adolescents (age 16.0 ± 0.8 years, weight 66.3 ± 9.9 kg, height 176.2 ± 6.0 cm) was registered by means of an 3D optical system and the torsion of both hemi-pelvises against each other was calculated based on a simplified geometrical model. Tenderness on palpation of the pubic symphysis was assessed by means of a visual analogue scale, and isometric torques of knee extensors and flexors were measured for both legs. The torque ratio between knee extensors and flexors was calculated for both sides, as was the crossed torque ratio between the two legs. On the basis of a MANOVA, possible significant differences in torques and torque ratios between subgroups with lower and higher pelvic torsion were analyzed. The crossed torque ratio (F = 19.55, p &lt; 0.001, partial η2 = 0.453) and the tenderness to palpation of the pubic symphysis (F = 10.72, p = 0.003, partial η2 = 0.309) were significantly higher in the subgroup with higher pelvic torsion. The results indicate the crossed torque ratio of knee flexors and extensors as a potential biomechanical-pathogenic mechanism to be considered in the primary prevention and diagnosis of symphyseal pain."

Objective To analyze the effects of cold-water immersion on delayed-onset muscle soreness, muscle recruitment, and postural control in soccer players. Objective The maximum load of the quadriceps femoris muscle strength was determined. After three days, the pain scale was used to measure the subject’s pain intensity. The recruitment of the quadriceps muscle was determined at the moment of the kick, and was associated with postural control. Methods Randomized, blinded clinical trial study. Two repeated series of maximum load sets at 60% MVC, performed in a knee extension chair, were used to induce quadriceps fatigue in the athletes. Participants Twenty-eight soccer players were allocated to four intervention groups: cold water immersion (CWIG, n = 7), thermoneutral water immersion (TWIG, n = 7), active recovery (ARG, n = 7), and rest (RG, n = 7), with each intervention being carried out for ten minutes. Revaluations were carried out after 24, 48, and 72 hours of the fatigue protocol. Results Pain intensity in the CWIG returned to baseline after 72 hours, while the TWIG, ARG, and RG continued to feel greater pain. For the other outcomes, no differences were found between the groups. Conclusion With regard to muscle recruitment and postural control at the time of the kick, no significant differences were found for the time periods or intervention established. Level of evidence I; High-quality randomized clinical trial with or without statistically significant difference, but with narrow confidence intervals."

However, issues remain with existing approaches to PA, including limitations in the methods, an unclear conceptual base for PA, a gap between research and coaching practice, the reluctance of coaches to adopt novel methods, and guidance on how PA can move forward. This chapter briefly discusses limitations of the current PA methods in football and then introduces and demonstrates novel methods from Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) that can be used to investigate and potentially resolve some of these problems. Given that team sports, and specifically football are characteristic of a complex system, in this chapter we propose that methods used in HFE could enhance football PA, and subsequently the coaching process and ultimately performance. To demonstrate the utility of these methods, the current chapter describes how Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), Social Network Analysis (SNA), the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST), and the Critical Decision Method (CDM), can be used for PA in football and sport in general."

Team sport athletes experience more ACL injuries than ballet and modern dancers. Examining biomechanical differences between these two groups may help to explain the discrepancy in ACL injury rates. The purpose of this study was to examine lower extremity kinematic differences between collegiate dancers and National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I soccer athletes during a rebound jump-landing task. Peak hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were collected during a jump-landing task. Results showed more knee flexion and less ankle eversion in the dancers compared to the soccer athletes. Differences in training and strategies used during landing may explain the kinematic differences between groups."

It is estimated that the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) among adults 60 years of age or older is approximately 10% in men and 13% in women, making knee OA one of the leading causes of disability in elderly population. Today, we know that osteoarthritis is not a disease characterized by loss of cartilage due to mechanical loading only, but a condition that affects all of the tissues in the joint, causing detectable changes in tissue architecture, its metabolism and function. All of these changes are mediated by a complex and not yet fully researched interplay of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adipokines, all of which can be measured in the serum, synovium and histological samples, potentially serving as biomarkers of disease stage and progression. Another key aspect of disease progression is the epigenome that regulates all the genetic expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and mRNA interference. A lot of work has been put into developing non-surgical treatment options to slow down the natural course of osteoarthritis to postpone, or maybe even replace extensive surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty. At the moment, biological treatments such as platelet-rich plasma, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and autologous microfragmented adipose tissue containing stromal vascular fraction are ordinarily used. Furthermore, the latter two mentioned cell-based treatment options seem to be the only methods so far that increase the quality of cartilage in osteoarthritis patients. Yet, in the future, gene therapy could potentially become an option for orthopedic patients. In the following review, we summarized all of the latest and most important research in basic sciences, pathogenesis, and non-operative treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3044104501,Is There a Relationship Between Workload and Occurrence of Back Pain and Back Injuries in Athletes?,2020-07-24,2020,review,"The back is subjected to a great deal of strain in many sports. Up to 20% of all sports injuries involve an injury to the lower back or neck. Repetitive or high impact loads (e.g., running, gymnastics, skiing) and weight loading (e.g., weightlifting) affect the lower back. Rotation of the torso (e.g., golf, tennis) causes damage to both, the lumbar and thoracic spine. The cervical spine is most commonly injured in contact sports (e.g., boxing, football). One of the factors that increases the odds of injuries in athletes is excessive and rapid increases in training loads. In spite of currently emerging evidence on this issue, little is known about the balance between physiological loading on the spine and athletic performance, versus overloading and back pain and/or injury in athletes. This scoping review aims (i) to map the literature that addresses the association between the training load and the occurrence of back pain and/or injury, especially between the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) and back problems in athletes of individual and team sports, and (ii) to identify gaps in existing literature and propose future research on this topic. A literature search of six electronic databases (i.e., MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, SportDiscus, and CINAHL) was conducted. A total of 48 research articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings identified that fatigue of the trunk muscles induced by excessive loading of the spine is one of the sources of back problems in athletes. In particular, high training volume and repetitive motions are responsible for the high prevalence rates. The most influential are biomechanical and physiological variations underlying the spine, though stress-related psychological factors should also be considered. However, limited evidence exists on the relationship between the ACWR and back pain or non-contact back injuries in athletes from individual and team sports. This may be due to insufficiently specified the acute and chronic time window that varies according to sport-specific schedule of competition and training. More research is therefore warranted to elucidate whether ACWR, among other factors, is able to identify workloads that could increase the risk of back problems in athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3044735661,Directional Control Mechanisms in Multidirectional Step Initiating Tasks,2020-07-21,2020,article,"Typical anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in forward gait or step initiation tasks to prepare for possible disturbances caused by prime voluntary movements and to accelerate the body forward have been previously reported. However, it is not clear how wide the variations in step directions are differentiated and controlled in non-forward step initiation tasks during the APA phase. The main goal of this study is to explain the directional control mechanisms by investigating the APA of step initiation tasks in forward, diagonal, lateral, and posterior directions. The center of pressure (COP) trajectories and related muscle (soleus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius of both lower limbs) activities during the APA of step initiation tasks in nine different directions were analyzed in six healthy young males. Posterior shifts of COP during APA decreased as the direction became more lateral (0° to 90°). For posterior step initiations, COP moved anteriorly from the initial position to accelerate the center of mass of the whole body (COM) backward. Lateral shifts of COP toward the stepping foot during APA decreased as the stepping direction became more lateral (from 0° to 45° and from 180° to 113°) while it plateaued to about zero in the direction from 45° to 113°. Both anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP in APA were nonlinearly modulated to each direction, but they were linearly related to the anteroposterior and mediolateral component of the velocities of COM at take-off of the stance foot. Thus, the scaling of APA, reflected in the anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP and the temporal sequence of selected muscle activities, was based on the anteroposterior and mediolateral components of the take-off velocity of COM that ultimately controls the direction of steps."

Due to its non-contact nature, it is considered as one of the safer team sports. The specificity of contusions in volleyball players is related to the type of performed and repeated movement patterns. The aim of the study was to describe the issue of injuries among volleyball players - most common anatomical locations, mechanisms, risk factors, methods of prevention. The article was created on the basis of a literature review. The most common type of injury found in volleyball players is ankle sprain. Overuse injuries most often affect the knees and shoulders. Blocking and spiking are elements of the volleyball game most closely related to contusions. Risk factors include position / role on the court, history of previous injuries and adaptive changes in the musculoskeletal system. The basic form of prevention is education regarding the development of an appropriate game technique and correct movement patterns. An important part of the training of volleyball players should be adequate warm-up, mobilization exercises and stretching. Further research should focus on understanding more precisely and describing the etiology of injuries. This could translate into the development of specific prophylaxis in the future, especially in relation to the areas of the body of volleyball players most affected by contusions. The effectiveness of injury prevention methods should be tested by carrying out large and well-designed scientific studies to provide data with high evidence strength."

Therefore, we will evaluate the function of representation and then discuss the cognitive architecture of skilled actions in more depth. We are going to describe the building blocks and levels of the action system that enable us to control movements such as striking the tennis ball at the right time, or grasping tools in manual action. Based on this theoretical understanding the measurement of mental representations and related research results concerning mental representation in skilled action are presented in an overview. This leads to the question how mental representations develop and change during learning. Finally, to consolidate the functional understanding of mental representation in skilled action and interaction, we provide examples how to use the measurement of mental representation in humans to inform technical systems."

Motor-motor dual tasks occur within dynamic environments and change the demand for attentional resources needed to complete athletic maneuvers, which may contribute to injury risk. Objective To investigate the influence of anticipation and motor-motor task performance on cutting biomechanics. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A total of 32 healthy, recreationally active men (age = 23.1 ± 3.6 years, height = 180.0 ± 7.0 cm, mass = 81.3 ± 17.3 kg) who self-reported regular participation in cutting sports. Intervention(s) Participants performed a 45° side-step cut on the dominant limb in a random order of conditions: anticipation (anticipated, unanticipated) and task (no ball throw, ball fake, ball throw). Main Outcome Measure(s) Triplanar trunk, hip, and knee angles were assessed throughout the stance phase using 3-dimensional motion capture. Data were analyzed using a time series of means calculated from initial contact to toe-off (0%–100%) with 90% confidence intervals. Mean differences between conditions were identified as regions of nonoverlapping confidence intervals, and those that occurred during the region of peak vertical ground reaction force (0%–25%) are presented. Results Regardless of anticipation, attending to a ball (ball throw) resulted in more trunk extension (range = 2.9°–3.7°) and less lateral trunk flexion toward the cutting direction (range = 5.2°–5.9°). Planning to attend to a ball (ball fake) resulted in less lateral trunk flexion toward the cutting direction (4.7°). During unanticipated cutting, more trunk rotation away from the cutting direction was observed when attending to a ball (range = 5.3°–7.1°). The interaction of anticipation and task had a similar influence on sagittal- and frontal-plane trunk position. Conclusions Motor-motor task performance and its interaction with anticipation induced an upright, neutral trunk position during side-step cutting, which has been associated with the risk for noncontact knee injury. Promoting task complexity during rehabilitation and injury-prevention programs may better prepare individuals to succeed when performing high-risk athletic maneuvers."
https://openalex.org/W3044938759,Landing Evaluation in Soccer Players with or without Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,2020-07-20,2020,article,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate landing biomechanics in soccer players following ACLR during two landing tasks. Eighteen soccer players with an ACLR and 18 sex-matched healthy control soccer players participated in the study. Planned landing included jumping forward and landing on the force-plates, whereas unplanned landing included jumping forward to head a soccer ball and landing on the force-plates. A significant landing×group interaction was found only for knee flexion angles (p=0.002). Follow-up comparisons showed that the ACL group landed with greater knee flexion during planned landing compared with unplanned landing (p&lt;0.001). Significant main effects of landing were found. The unplanned landing showed reduction in hip flexion (p&lt;0.001), hip extension moments (p&lt;0.013), knee extension moments (p&lt;0.001), and peak pressure (p&lt;0.001). A significant main effect for group for gastrocnemius muscle was found showing that the ACL group landed with reduced gastrocnemius activity (p=0.002). Unplanned landing showed greater injury predisposing factors compared with planned landing. The ACL group showed nearly similar landing biomechanics to the control group during both landing tasks. However, the ACL group used a protective landing strategy by reducing gastrocnemius activity."
https://openalex.org/W3011869789,THE CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF INJURIES IN HANDBALL,2020-07-20,2020,article,"The aim of this work is to present and analyse the handball literature on the causes of injuries, types of injuries and their anatomic locations, as well as the prevention measurements. Based on the results of the analysed studies, it can be concluded that there is a significant number of injuries, of different body parts and of different severity in top-level handball players. Overuse injuries (to certain body parts, such as the more dominant shoulder, the ankle and the knee) are considered to be most prominent. In order to prevent the injuries to the mouth and teeth, the use of mouthguard is recommended. When it comes to the prevention and rehabilitation of shoulder injuries, the research results have shown positive effects that the training aiming at the increase of the inner rotation of the glenohumeral strength, the outer rotation strength and the scapular muscles strength has along with the exercises for improving the kinetic chain and the chest flexibility. The use of elastic bands and the medicine ball has proven efficient in increasing the shoulder area strength, and the whole swing and throw movement. The ankle and the knee are the most frequently injured joints among female handball players. The results of the application of the neuromuscular training, the proprioception and the balance exercises, combined with some specific players’ activities (running, jumping and planting) show that such training process is efficient in the prevention of injuries to ankle and knee joints."

https://openalex.org/W3043114393,Biomechanical Analysis of Woodpecker Response During Pecking Using a Two-Dimensional Computational Model,2020-07-17,2020,article,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to the impact is a critical health concern. Impact mitigation strategy is a vital design paradigm to reduce the burden of TBI and CTE. In this regard, woodpecker biomimicry continues to attract attention. However, a direct comparison between a woodpecker and human biomechanical responses is lacking. Toward this end, we investigate the biomechanical response of a woodpecker during pecking using a two-dimensional head model. We also analyze the response of concurrent human head model to facilitate direct comparison with woodpecker response. The head models of woodpecker and human were built from medical images, the material properties were adopted from the literature. Both woodpecker and human head models were subjected to head kinematics obtained during pecking and resulting biomechanical response is studied. For the pecking cycle simulated in this work, peak rotational velocity and acceleration were ∼15 rad/s and 7,057 rad/s2. These peak values are commensurate with the kinematics threshold values reported in human TBI. Our results show that, for the same input acceleration, the strains and stresses in the woodpecker brain are approximately six times lower than that of the human brain. The stress reduction is mainly attributed to the smaller size of the woodpecker head. The effect of pecking frequency and multiple pecking cycles have also been studied. It is observed that the strains and stresses in the brain are increased by ∼100% as pecking frequency is doubled. During multiple pecking cycle, dwell period of ∼90 ms tend to relax the stresses in the woodpecker brain; however, the amount of relaxation depends on the value of the decay constant. The comparison of biomechanical response against the axonal injury threshold suggests that for peak rotational acceleration of 7,057 rad/s2 the maximum principal strain in the brains of woodpecker and human exceed the threshold limit. Acceleration scaling relationship between a woodpecker and equivalent human response is also developed as a function of head size. We obtain a scaling factor, ahaw , of 0.11 for baseline head sizes and a scaling factor of 1.03 as the human head size approaches woodpecker head size."
https://openalex.org/W3043056542,Repetitive Head Trauma Induces Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy by Multiple Mechanisms,2020-07-16,2020,review,"Abstract Exposure to repetitive neurotrauma increases lifetime risk for developing progressive cognitive deficits, neurobehavioral abnormalities, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a tau protein neurodegenerative disease first identified in boxers and recently described in athletes participating in other contact sports (notably American football, ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling) and in military veterans with blast exposure. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed by neuropathological examination of the brain after death. The defining diagnostic lesion of CTE consists of patchy perivascular accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that localize in the sulcal depths of the cerebral cortex. Neuronal abnormalities, axonopathy, neurovascular dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are triggered by repetitive head impacts (RHIs) and likely act as catalysts for CTE pathogenesis and progression. However, the specific mechanisms that link RHI to CTE are unknown. This review will explore two important areas of CTE pathobiology. First, we will review what is known about the biomechanical properties of RHI that initiate CTE-related pathologies. Second, we will provide an overview of key features of CTE neuropathology and how these contribute to abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation, accumulation, and spread."

Informed by insights from psychology, pedagogy, and sport science, this position paper presents a practitioner-based approach in response to the overarching question: When, why, and how could coaches provide information to athletes during coaching interventions? In an ecological dynamics rationale, practice is seen as a search for functional performance solutions, and augmented feedback is outlined as instructional constraints to guide athletes' self-regulation of action in practice. Using the exemplar of team sports, we present a Skill Training Communication Model for practical application in the context of the role of a specialist coach, using a constraints-led approach (CLA). Further based on principles of a non-linear pedagogy and using the recently introduced Periodization of Skill Training (PoST) framework, the proposed model aims to support practitioners' understanding of the pedagogical constraints of feedback and instruction during practice. In detail, the PoST framework's three skill development and training stages work to (1) directly impact constraint manipulations in practice designs and (2) indirectly affect coaches' choices of external (coach-induced) information. In turn, these guide practitioners on how and when to apply different verbal instruction methodologies and aim to support the design of effective skill learning environments. Finally, several practical guidelines in regard to sports coaches' feedback and instruction processes are proposed."

Evidence supporting best practice guidelines to manage ACL injury is largely based on studies with low-level evidence. An international consensus group of experts was convened determine consensus regarding best available evidence on operative versus non-operative treatment for ACL injury. The purpose of this study is to report the consensus statements on operative versus non-operative treatment of ACL injuries developed at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019. Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organising Committee and Session Chairs. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided initial agreement and comments on the statement via online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty per cent agreement was defined a priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative versus non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached consensus during the Symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support, two reached strong consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting and pivoting sports, early anatomical ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomical ACL reconstruction is indicated. The consensus statements derived from international leaders in the field may assist clinicians in deciding between operative and non-operative treatment with patients after an ACL injur y .

Seventy-four male players (age: 25 ± 4 years, stature: 178.0 ± 6.6 cm, body mass: 74.9 ± 8.1 kg) were assessed at the beginning and end of the off-season summer-period for sprint, change-of-direction performance and eccentric hamstring strength. Small to medium increases in sprint times were observed at 5 (d = 0.26, p = 0.057), 10 (d = 0.42, p < 0.001) and 30 m (d = 0.64, p < 0.001). Small (d = -0.23, p = 0.033) improvements were observed for COD performance, and no changes in eccentric hamstring strength (d = 0.10, p = 0.317). The changes in the outcomes were not affected by age (p = 0.449 to 0.928) or previous hamstring injury (p = 0.109 to 0.995). The impaired sprint performance was not related to changes in eccentric hamstring strength (r = -0.21 to 0.03, p = 0.213 to 0.856), instead, changes in COD performance were associated with changes in eccentric hamstring strength (r = -0.42, p = 0.008)."

Regrettably, scientific studies on the skill cannot be found in the literature. Relying on the talent of athletes to improvise on the fly can hardly be considered a viable learning method. This study targeted to fill this gap by quantifying the factors of the jumping side volley and to contribute to the development of a coaching method for it. Using 3D motion capture (12 cameras, 200 Hz) and full-body biomechanical modeling, our study aimed to identify elements that govern the entrainment of skill execution. Given the rarity of players who have acquired this skill and the low success rate of the kick (even in professional games), we were able to achieve and review 23 successful trials from five college-level subjects and quantify them for the study. The results unveiled the following key elements: (1) the control of trunk rotation during jumping, (2) the angle between thighs upon take-off, (3) the whip-like control of the kicking leg while airborne, (4) timing between ball motion and limb coordination, and (5) damping mechanism during falling. An accurate kick can normally be achieved through repetitive training. This underlines the need for athletes to master a safe landing technique that minimizes risk of injury during practice. Therefore, training should begin with learning a safe falling technique."

The aim of this study was to assess differences in mechanical properties during sprinting between youth and senior international cricketers and between seam bowlers and batters. Retrospective 40 m sprint times and anthropometric measures of 56 international cricketers (19 senior seam bowlers, 7 under-19 seam bowlers, 16 senior batters, 14 under-19 batters) were used to calculate the theoretical maximal force (F 0 ), theoretical maximal velocity (V (0) ), theoretical maximal power (P max ), slope of the force-velocity relationship (F-V slope), maximal ratio of horizontal-to-resultant force (RF max ), decrease in the ratio of horizontal-to-resultant force (DRF) and optimum velocity (V opt ). There were no significant (P &gt; 0.05) differences in sprint times nor sprint mechanical profile variables between position or age. However, there was a moderately greater F 0 (N/Kg) (ES = 0.78; 90% CI 0.19–1.34) and RF max (ES = 0.75; 90% CI 0.11–1.35) in senior seam bowlers when compared to batters. Furthermore, FV Slope (ES = 0.79; 90% CI 0.15–1.40) and DRF (ES = 0.75; 90% CI 0.11–1.35) were moderately greater in senior compared to under-19 batters. When expressed relative to body mass, it appears that senior international seam bowlers show trends towards a more force biased profile during sprinting when compared to batters. These findings will help coaches to optimise physical preparation strategies in youth and senior international cricketers."

There is no consensus in the literature on the best treatment approach in the treatment of these ruptures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical long-term results of the augmented ATR repair using the modified Lindholm procedure (MLP). Methods Patients who underwent MLP due to ATR in the orthopedics and traumatology clinic of our hospital between 2007 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Medical history of the patients was noted, and preoperative physical examination was routinely performed using the Thompson compression test. Patients' demographic data such as age and gender, tendon rupture side, postoperative follow-up duration, and gap range values were recorded and evaluated. Results The mean age of the patients was 29.43 ± 7.10 years. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 50.1 ± 8.20 months. Of the patients, 16 were injured during football, 10 during basketball, 2 during volleyball, and the remaining 8 during other sporting activities. When Arner-Lindholm scores were evaluated during follow-up, excellent outcome was achieved in 30 patients and good outcome was achieved in 6 patients, whereas there was no patient with poor outcome. None of the patients developed tendon re-rupture. At the end of the fourth postoperative month, the range of ankle motion was 100% in all patients. Conclusions In patients with spontaneous AT tendon rupture, MLP seems to prevent the re-rupture in the long-term period and should be considered as a safe procedure to repair ATR."

Student characteristics (age, sex, BMI, educational program, and history of injury) and psychological constructs (coping, perfectionism, and self-regulation) were assessed using the Performing artist and Athlete Health Monitor (PAHM), a web-based system. Substantial injuries were measured with the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Questionnaire on Health Problems and recorded on a monthly basis as part of the PAHM system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the associations between potential risk factors (i.e., student characteristics and psychological constructs) and substantial injuries. Ninety-nine students were included in the analyses. During the academic year 2016/2017, 48 students (48.5%) reported at least one substantial injury. Of all factors included, coping skills (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84-0.98), age (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.46-0.98), and BMI (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.05-1.80) were identified as significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis. The model explained 24% of the variance in the substantial injury group. Further prospective research into mental risk factors for dance injuries with larger sample sizes is needed to develop preventive strategies. Yet, dance schools could consider including coping skills training as part of injury prevention programs and, perhaps, providing special attention to younger dancers and those with a higher BMI through transitional programs to assist them in managing the stress they experience throughout their (academic) career."

For a substance or method to be considered for the WADA Prohibited List, three criteria must be met: (1) the substance or method has the potential to enhance, or enhances, sport performance; (2) use of the substance or method represents an actual or potential health risk to the athlete; and (3) use of the substance or method violates the ""spirit of sport"". The ""spirit of sport"" is defined as ""the celebration of the human spirit, body and mind"" and explained with reference to a series of ideal values: ethics, fair play, and honesty; health; excellence in performance; character and education; fun and enjoyment; teamwork; dedication and commitment; respect for rules and laws; respect for self and other participants; courage; community and solidarity. These values do not lend themselves to clear-cut interpretation and are of little help in drawing unambiguous lines in concrete cases. A proposal is made of how to interpret the ""spirit of sport"" in more precise ways in terms of a combination of the fair opportunity principle and a biological and evolutionary understanding of athletic performance as a result of the systematic utilization of the phenotypic plasticity of the human organism. The argument is that such understanding improves significantly the possibilities for drawing of lines when it comes to doping issues."

This paper explores the role of genetic technology in elite sport and questions the significance of dichotomizing between the natural and artificial element. How do shifts in technology affect the attribution of the human element in athletic performance? To explore the attribution of human agency we compare the genetic enhancement of athletes with two other shifts of the 'natural performance' in sport: first, the introduction of a revolutionary high jump technique, the Fosbury flop, in 1968; and, second, the introduction of the klapskate in speed skating in 1997. The three cases show that artificiality as such can hardly be a criterion for evaluating processes of innovation. The context of elite sport is itself highly artificial. Boundaries between the natural body and the enhanced body are the outcome of institutional processes of boundary work. When discussing new technologies in sport it is better to ask if athletes are still playing the same game and whether or not there are equal opportunities and an equal distribution of means for playing the game. The introduction of gene technology may result in inequalities, with great impact on the outcome of the game. This outcome may be considered irrelevant for the inequalities that the game is supposed to produce and measure. Genetic enhancement may also threaten the public view of athletes as moral agents and possibly change the appreciation for human performance."

However, the mechanical properties of treadmill surfaces remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the shock absorption (SA), vertical deformation (VD) and energy restitution (ER) of different treadmill models and to compare them with those of other sport surfaces. A total of 77 treadmills, 30 artificial turf pitches and 30 athletics tracks were assessed using an advanced artificial athlete device. Differences in the mechanical properties between the surfaces and treadmill models were evaluated using a repeated-measures ANOVA. The treadmills were found to exhibit the highest SA of all the surfaces (64.2 ± 2; p < 0.01; effect size (ES) = 0.96), while their VD (7.6 ± 1.3; p < 0.01; ES = 0.87) and ER (45 ± 11; p < 0.01; ES = 0.51) were between the VDs of the artificial turf and track. The SA (p < 0.01; ES = 0.69), VD (p < 0.01; ES = 0.90) and ER (p < 0.01; ES = 0.89) were also shown to differ between treadmill models. The differences between the treadmills commonly used in fitness centers were much lower than differences between the treadmills and track surfaces, but they were sometimes larger than the differences with artificial turf. The treadmills used in clinical practice and research were shown to exhibit widely varying mechanical properties. The results of this study demonstrate that the mechanical properties (SA, VD and ER) of treadmill surfaces differ significantly from those of overground sport surfaces such as artificial turf and athletics track surfaces but also asphalt or concrete. These different mechanical properties of treadmills may affect treadmill running performance, injury risk and the generalizability of research performed on treadmills to overground locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W3041160525,Coaches’ perspective towards skill acquisition in swimming: What practice approaches are typically applied in training?,2020-07-09,2020,article,"This study aimed to explore the experiential knowledge and preferred training approaches of elite swimming coaches in regards to general skill development and then looking specifically at the freestyle stroke. A qualitative thematic analysis approach was employed to identify, analyse and report themes within the content of the collected data. Twenty elite swimming coaches participated in semi-structured interviews. Several themes revealed that the most common training practices employed to improve skill learning included the use of task decomposition (part-task) techniques. The findings also indicated that swimming coaches believe practice should be specific/representative to the intended performance outcomes. It is believed that such viewpoints may have been influenced by coaches' interaction with skill acquisition consultants and may have also shaped some coaches use of variants of constraints manipulation in their practice design. While swimming coaches seem to mix both traditional and contemporary skill acquisition theories in their training prescriptions, the traditional approach is dominant as evidenced by coaches seeking to reinforce ""perfect"" swimming technique and mechanical consistency. Considering coaches' experiential knowledge and training prescriptions may benefit future research protocols and better facilitate the transfer of empirical findings to coaching practice."

The standardized running test consisted of four 60-m runs paced at ~5 m·s-1 with 33 seconds of recovery between trials. Data from micromechanical electrical systems were used to calculate a running-load index (RLI), which was a ratio between the mechanical load and the speed performed during runs. RLI was calculated by using either the entire duration of the run or a constant-velocity period. For each type of calculation, either an individual directional or the sum of the 3 components of the accelerometer was used. A measure of leg stiffness was used to assess the convergent validity of the RLI.Unclear to large relationships between leg stiffness and RLI were found (r ranged from -.20 to .62). Regarding reliability, small to moderate (.47-.86) standardized typical errors were found. The sensitivity analysis showed that the leg stiffness presented a very likely trivial change over the course of 1 week of training, whereas RLI showed very likely small to a most likely large change.This study showed that RLI is a practical method to measure neuromuscular fatigue. In addition, such a methodology aligns with the constraint of elite team-sport setup due to its ease of implementation in practice."

Twenty players (age: 16.5 ± 0.3 years; body mass: 72.2 ± 5.5 kg; body height: 180.6 ± 4.6 cm) were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: RST (n = 10) and CG (n = 10). The training program was similar for both groups consisting of acceleration and deceleration exercises at short distances (3-4 m), and speed and agility drills. The RST group used weighted vests or elastic cords during the exercises. After 6 weeks of intervention, both training regimes resulted in small-to-moderate improvements in acceleration and sprint ability (5, 10, 20 m), SLJ and CMJ performances, COD pivoting on both, the non-dominant (moderate effect) and the dominant (small effect) foot, and the percentage of decrement (small effects) during a RSA test. Between-group comparisons showed that the SLJ (Δ = 2.0%) and 5 m sprint time (Δ = 1.1%) improved more in the RST group compared with the CG group. This study showed that 6 weeks of RST or unresisted training are time-efficient training regimes for physical improvements in young male tennis players."

Biological agents generally have limited observation and mechanical constraints; however, most of the conventional data-driven models ignore such assumptions, resulting in lack of biological plausibility and model interpretability for behavioral analyses in biological and cognitive science. Here we propose sequential generative models with partial observation and mechanical constraints, which can visualize whose information the agents utilize and can generate biologically plausible actions. We formulate this as a decentralized multi-agent imitation learning problem, leveraging binary partial observation models with a Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization and policy models based on hierarchical variational recurrent neural networks with physical and biomechanical constraints. We investigate the empirical performances using real-world multi-person motion datasets from basketball and soccer games."

Consequently, athletes and federations are beginning to explore the possible benefits to elite sport performance for the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, which will take place in hot (~ 31 °C), humid (70% RH) conditions. There is no clear consensus on safe and effective menthol use for athletes, practitioners, or researchers. The present study addressed this shortfall by producing expert-led consensus recommendations. Method: Fourteen contributors were recruited following ethical approval. A three-step modified Delphi method was used for voting on 96 statements generated following literature consultation; 192 statements total (96/96 topical application/mouth rinsing). Round 1 contributors voted to “agree” or “disagree” with statements; 80% agreement was required to accept statements. In round 2, contributors voted to “support” or “change” their round 1 unaccepted statements, with knowledge of the extant voting from round 1. Round 3 contributors met to discuss voting against key remaining statements. Results: Forty-seven statements reached consensus in round 1 (30/17 topical application/rinsing); 14 proved redundant. Six statements reached consensus in round 2 (2/4 topical application/rinsing); 116 statements proved redundant. Nine further statements were agreed in round 3 (6/3 topical application/rinsing) with caveats. Discussion: Consensus was reached on 62 statements in total (38/24 topical application/rinsing), enabling the development of guidance on safe menthol administration, with a view to enhancing performance and perception in the heat without impairing body temperature regulation."

Although sex-dependent differences have been identified for adults, less is known for preadolescent athletes regarding movement patterns known to load the ACL.We hypothesized that girls would demonstrate greater vertical ground reaction forces and knee valgus angles. We further hypothesized that the exercise intervention would affect girls more than boys and that this would primarily be demonstrated in less sagittal plane excursions, increased vertical ground reaction forces and knee valgus moments for girls than for boys.Controlled laboratory study.Male and female soccer and handball players (n = 288; age range, 9-12 years) were recruited. A motion capture system synchronized to a force platform was used to record 5 trials of a cutting maneuver before and after a 5-minute fatigue intervention. Linear mixed models were constructed, and analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in outcomes associated with the sex of the athletes.Boys showed greater peak knee valgus moment (0.26 vs 0.22 N·m/kg, respectively; P = .048), peak knee internal rotation moment (-0.13 vs -0.10 N·m/kg, respectively; P = .021), knee rotation excursion (-7.9° vs -6.9°, respectively; P = .014), and knee extension excursion (2.7° vs 1.4°, respectively; P < .001) compared with that in girls. A significant sex × fatigue intervention interaction (F = 7.6; P = .006) was found, which was caused by a greater increase in first peak vertical ground-reaction force (vGRF) from before to after the fatigue intervention for girls (15.3 to 16.0 N/kg) compared with boys (16.4 to 16.5 N/kg).Differences detected for biomechanical factors during the cutting maneuver do not point to a greater ACL injury risk for prepubescent or early pubescent girls than for boys. Nonetheless, girls go on to develop more detrimental movement patterns in adolescence than those in boys in terms of biomechanical risk factors.Early adolescence is a good target age to learn and develop muscular control; balance, strength; flexibility; and jumping, running, and landing control. This time of physical and athletic growth may therefore be an appropriate period to influence biomechanical factors and thereby task execution and the injury risk."
https://openalex.org/W3036405810,Nobody says to you “come back in six months and we’ll see how you’re doing”: a qualitative interview study exploring young adults’ experiences of sport-related knee injury,2020-07-01,2020,article,"Abstract Background Regular exercise is vital for overall health, and key to the maintenance of joint health. However, whilst people are encouraged to participate in sport and exercise, many are unaware that they could be at risk of developing post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in the years following sport-related injury. Younger adults (&lt; 40 years) with PTOA can experience declining quality of life, comorbid health conditions, and symptoms that place a chronic burden on health services. Conserving knee health through careful self-management in the latency period between injury and the onset of PTOA may help to delay disease progression. In this regard, the development of self-management interventions can be facilitated by understanding the post-injury experiences of young adults and their attitudes towards joint health. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 young adults following a sport-related knee injury to explore their experiences of injury, and their attitudes and perceptions of self-managing knee health. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed systematically using an inductive approach. Results Four themes pertaining to participants’ experiences were identified: [1] perceptions of current care provision; [2] long-term impact of knee injury; [3] motivation to conserve knee health; and [4] opportunities for supplementary support. The expression “Nobody says to you ‘come back in six months and we’ll see how you’re doing’” personifies the long-term impact of knee injury on young adults and a paucity of care provision. Conclusion Participants did not perceive that they had adequate care in the aftermath of knee injury, leading to a sense of frustration and uncertainty. This had implications for continued participation in sport and exercise, negatively impacting their athletic identity and sense of wellbeing. Activity tracking, symptom monitoring, advice provision and peer support were identified as tools to enable individuals to self-manage knee health."

Such microhemorrhages have been identified in adult contact sport athletes, and the sequelae of these focal bleeds are thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. The purpose of this study was to utilize SWI to determine whether the prevalence and incidence of microhemorrhages in adolescent football players are significantly greater than those of adolescent noncontact athletes. Preseason and postseason SWI was performed and evaluated on 78 adolescent football players. SWI was also performed on 27 adolescent athletes who reported no contact sport history. Two separate one-tailed Fisher exact tests were performed to determine whether the prevalence and incidence of microhemorrhages in adolescent football players are greater than those of noncontact athlete controls. Microhemorrhages were observed in 12 football players. No microhemorrhages were observed in any controls. Adolescent football players demonstrated a significantly greater prevalence of microhemorrhages than adolescent noncontact controls (P = .02). Although 2 football players developed new microhemorrhages during the season, microhemorrhage incidence during 1 football season was not statistically greater in the football population than in noncontact control athletes (P = .55). Adolescent football players have a greater prevalence of microhemorrhages compared with adolescent athletes who have never engaged in contact sports. While microhemorrhage incidence during 1 season is not significantly greater in adolescent football players compared to adolescent controls, there is a temporal association between playing football and the appearance of new microhemorrhages."

The current study aimed to compare the kinematics of the lower limb joints in jump-landing maneuver among soccer players with and without a history of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: Among active soccer players in the provincial league level in Hamedan Province, Iran, 12 individuals with the intact knee (control group), and 12 individuals with 6 to 24 months post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (experimental group) were selected by convivence sampling method as the study participants. During the jump-landing task, the range of motion and the joints' angle at the contact instance were measured before and after performing plyometric fatigue protocol using the Vicon motion capture system. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) at a significance level of P&lt;0.05 was used for intergroup comparisons. Results: Plyometric fatigue did not affect most of the kinematic variables before and after fatigue experience. Besides, only the hip range of motion revealed a significant difference between the study groups (P=0.38). Conclusion: Fatigue had more effect on some variables in individuals with ACL reconstruction, including the left and right hips angles. Moreover, there was a significant difference in some variables between the study groups; the range of motion of the left hip, the contact angle of the right hip before fatigue experience, and the contact angle of the right and left hips after fatigue. In general, a proper rehabilitation program is recommended for athletes with ACL reconstruction to reduce the risk of recurrence of jumping movements in exercise."

Traditional scoring of these tests requires subjective judgement whereas new technology has allowed for automatic scoring and additional objective data. To date, few studies have examined sex differences in OHS and SLS performance and none measured with a marker-less motion capture system. PURPOSE: To determine if biomechanical differences exist between male and female collegiate athletes during performance of an OHS and SLS. METHODS: 75 female (18.1±0.4y; 166.9±6.5cm; 64.1±10.2kg) and 58 male (18.7±1.2y; 184.4±7.1cm; 86.9±15.2kg) collegiate athletes completed OHS and SLS testing as part of their pre-participation exam. Men’s sports included football (n=24), baseball (n=19), lacrosse (n=10), and swimming (n=5); women’s sports included track and field (n=23), field hockey (n=12), softball (n=12), lacrosse (n=9), swimming (n=7), soccer (n=6), golf (n=3), tennis (n=2), and gymnastics (n=1). Participants completed 4 OHSs followed by 4 SLSs on each leg. A Microsoft Kinect sensor using Athletic Movement Assessment software (PhysiMax®) was used to measure all kinematic variables. Differences between males and females were assessed with independent t-tests. RESULTS: For the OHS, males displayed greater peak knee varus (M: 25.7°±9.6°, F: 19.8°±8.2°; P<0.001), peak hip flexion (M: -93.6°±-14.41°, F: -86.9°±-14.5°; P<0.05), and peak trunk flexion angles (M: 11.5°±10.9°, F: 6.3°±9.2°; P<0.01). Females displayed greater peak ankle dorsiflexion angles (F: -28.7°±-5.8°, M: -26.5°±-6.3°; P<0.05). For the SLS (dominant limb), males displayed greater peak trunk flexion (M: 32.2°±5.6°, F: 27.6°±6.6°; P <0.001) and lateral pelvic angles (M: 4.2°±3.9°, F: 2.9°±2.7°; P<0.05). For the non-dominant limb, females displayed greater peak knee valgus angles (F: -12.5°±-9.1°, M: -8.9°±-9.1°; P<0.05) whereas males displayed greater peak trunk flexion angles (M: 31.7°±5.5°, F: 27.5°±6.9°; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Male and female collegiate athletes displayed different movement strategies during performance of an OHS and SLS. Injury prevention programs may need to target sex-specific biomechanical patterns to improve movement capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3041303036,The Use Of Micro-doppler Radar For Motion Analysis In NCAA Athletes,2020-07-01,2020,article,"PURPOSE: The current musculoskeletal portion of the pre-participation physical exam lacks evidence for the detection of biomechanical subtleties that predispose an athlete to injury. Previous pilot data has shown that micro-Doppler radar has the potential to provide objective data on limb and torso variations at a granular level using a handheld, portable and cost effective device. The purpose of this study was to determine if micro-Doppler radar signals can predictably and accurately detect subtle differences in human movement patterns. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study using micro-Doppler radar technology to detect known differences in biomechanics among Division III athletes. Each participant performed 3 sets of 3 squat jumps in front of the micro-Doppler radar antenna. Each set of squat jumps was performed barefoot, with shoes and with a 2cm heel lift at both 0 degrees and turned 90 degrees to the antenna. The micro-Doppler responses were processed using short-time Fourier transform, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to highlight differences among the data sets and to minimize background noise from the radar. Further computer learning classification using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and discriminant analysis classifier were used to determine the micro-Doppler radar accuracy for predicting movement patterns. RESULTS: Thirty seven NCAA Division 3 Football athletes aged 18-22 were recruited and consented to perform the protocol. All micro-Doppler radar responses were recorded and processed successfully. The overall accuracy of the computer-derived models to predict which participants were wearing shoes, a heel lift or barefoot was 83%-100% for all groups regardless of whether the athlete was facing or turned to the right of the radar. CONCLUSIONS: This study was able to demonstrate that micro-Doppler radar technology has excellent predictability and can accurately detect subtle differences in movement. Future studies will aim to further validate data sets using comparison studies to biomechanical video analysis techniques. Ultimately the goal will be to use the micro-Doppler radar to define movement patterns that may predispose athletes to injury allowing us to determine a high risk group to direct injury prevention resources."

It is unknown if this dual task cost (DTC) measured during detailed motion capture testing is associated with DTC on simple clinical tests. Such a relationship may prove useful for improving clinically feasible return-to-play assessments. PURPOSE: Investigate whether dual-task ability spans clinical and laboratory methods of assessment. METHODS: Twenty-three female soccer players (21 ± 3yrs, 1.7 ± 0.1m, 64 ± 10kg) completed an agility drill requiring two 90° turns and one 180° turn. This was completed in isolation (baseline) and under three dual-task conditions: counting backwards by seven (S7), dribbling a soccer ball (BH), and combined ball dribbling and counting tasks (BHS7). Agility drill DTC (aDTC) was calculated as the percent change in completion time between dual-task and baseline conditions. A jump-land-jump task from a 30 cm box was also completed while 3D kinematics and kinetics were recorded. Dual task jump conditions included working memory (WM), working memory + visual attention task (WMV), and unanticipated working memory + visual attention task (UWMV) tasks. Biomechanical DTC (bDTC) was calculated as the percent change in peak knee valgus moment (pkVM) between dual-task jump landings and a single-task jump landing. Spearman’s rho correlations were run between all combinations of aDTC and bDTC (Figure 1).RESULTS: Increases in aDTC for the S7 condition were associated with increases in bDTC for the WMV (ρ=0.49, p=0.02) and the WM (ρ=0.43, p=0.04) conditions. No other relationships reached significance (i.e., p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Dual-task ability spanned clinical and laboratory assessments when the secondary task was an anticipated cognitive task. Further research is needed to establish the clinical utility of these relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3041197866,Neuromuscular Training Intervention Developed To Combat The Effects Of Acute Fatigue In Collegiate Pivoting Athletes,2020-07-01,2020,article,"PURPOSE: A large body of evidence has mounted supporting the efficacy of neuromuscular training (NMT) for prevention of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Incorporation of NMT with athletes has been shown to improve biomechanics during dynamic pivoting movements. However, there is a lack of literature to date examining the influence of NMT on biomechanical measures during dynamic movements in a state of acute fatigue. This study examined strength, dynamic balance, and lower quarter biomechanics while performing functional movements succeeding a short-term fatigue protocol in collegiate soccer athletes before and after an eight-week NMT intervention. METHODS: 28 Division II NCAA male and female soccer players ages 18-23 participated in the study. Hip strength was measured with hand dynamometry and single-leg stance modified balance (SLSM) was measured with eyes shut and in static heel rise. The Noraxon MyoMotion system assessed peak hip and knee excursion in three dimensions during select movement assessments following execution of the functional agility short-term fatigue protocol. Training consisted of 16 NMT sessions, performed over eight weeks, following which the tests were repeated. RESULTS: Improvements post-intervention were found in hip abduction strength L (p=0.015), hip extension strength R (p=0.031) and L (p=0.013); SLSM with eyes-closed on R (p=0.000) and L (p=0.000); SLSM with heel rise bilaterally (p=0.000); peak ROM for L hip abduction (p=.025), R knee flexion (p=0.002), and L knee flexion (p=0.006) during single-leg squat; peak ROM for R hip flexion (p=0.033) during bilateral squat; peak ROM for L hip flexion (p=0.045) and L knee flexion (p=0.000) during single-leg jump assessment and peak ROM for R knee flexion (p=0.029) and L knee flexion (p=0.045) during bilateral jump. CONCLUSIONS: Following the NMT intervention, proximal hip strength, dynamic balance, and functional loading capacity significantly improved, illustrating positive neuromuscular adaptations in the lower quarter and nervous system. Enhanced kinematics during select sport-specific movement assessments were evident by the MyoMyotion system following a fatigue protocol, defending the hypothesis that NMT can improve lower extremity biomechanics of collegiate pivoting athletes while acutely fatigued."
https://openalex.org/W3041333453,Frontal Plane Knee Biomechanics And Functional Movement Screen Scores Of Previously Injured DIII Football Players,2020-07-01,2020,article,"Football has the highest rate of knee injuries when compared to other contact sports (Rothenberg, 2016). It is important to investigate whether the risk for such injuries in NCAA Division III football players can be assessed by the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and frontal plane knee alignment during a single leg squat (SLS), as suggested by Kiesel et al (2007) and Ugalde (2015), respectively. PURPOSE: To compare FMS deep squat (DS) and active straight leg raise (ASLR) scores and to determine the relationship between frontal plane knee biomechanics in the SLS and ASLR and DS scores in healthy NCAA Division III football players and athletes with previous knee injuries. METHODS: Fourteen football players (mean age = 21.4) were recruited and consented to participate in this study. They completed the FMS and were rated by a certified level 1 FMS tester, then changed into black compression clothing. Markers were placed on the tibial tuberosity and distal tibia to define absolute valgus and varus angles at the deepest point of the SLS, where the supporting heel was still in contact with the ground. Trials were recorded using a digital camera facing the frontal plane and angles were measured using Dartfish Software. RESULTS: For the previously injured group (n=7), mean right SLS angle was 0.5° (valgus) and mean left SLS angle was 0.38° (varus), mean DS was 1.86, mean ASLR was 2.43, and mean composite score was 14.14. DS was negatively correlated with right (r = -0.13) and left (r=-0.12) SLS angles, right ASLR was negatively associated with right SLS (r = -0.12), left ASLR was negatively correlated to left SLS (r=-0.13). For the non-injured group (n=7), right SLS mean angle was 3.55° (valgus) and left mean SLS was 2.27° (valgus), mean DS was 2, mean ASLR was 2.43, and mean composite score was 15. DS was positively correlated with right (r = 0.59) and left (r= 0.86) SLS angles, right ASLR was negatively associated with right SLS (r = -0.13), left ASLR was negatively correlated to left SLS (r=-0.66). There was no significant difference in SLS angles, DS, or ASLR scores between groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Knee angles in the SLS, DS, and ASLR scores did not differ between groups. For the healthy group, DS had strong positive relationships with SLS angles and left ASLR had a moderate negative relationship to left SLS angles."
https://openalex.org/W3040390209,Lower Limb Asymmetry After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Adolescent Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020-06-30,2020,review,"Objectives To identify reported (1) common biomechanical asymmetries in the literature after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in adolescents during landing and (2) timescales for asymmetry to persist postsurgery. Data Sources We identified sources by searching the CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus electronic databases using the following search terms: asymmetry OR symmetry AND landing AND biomechanics OR kinematics OR kinetics. Study Selection We screened the titles and abstracts of 85 articles using our inclusion criteria. A total of 13 articles were selected for further analysis. Data Extraction Three reviewers independently assessed the methodologic quality of each study. We extracted the effect sizes directly from studies or calculated them for biomechanical variables assessing asymmetry between limbs of participants with ACL reconstruction. We conducted meta-analyses on variables that were assessed in multiple studies for both double- and single-limb landings. Data Synthesis Asymmetry was more commonly identified in kinetic than kinematic variables. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction appeared to have a large effect on asymmetry between limbs for peak vertical ground reaction force, peak knee-extension moment, and loading rate during double-limb landings, as well as mean knee-extension moment and knee energy absorption during both double- and single-limb landings. Conclusions Our findings suggested that return-to-sport criteria after ACL reconstruction should incorporate analysis of the asymmetry in loading experienced by each limb rather than movement patterns alone."

The study of functional asymmetry in students and schoolchildren practicing martial arts using a computer test. Material and Methods. The study involved students and schoolchildren (n = 38) practicing the martial arts (taekwondo, karate). Participants were divided into groups according to the sports’ skill level. The first group included experienced athletes (n = 15, age – 19.00 ± 0.45 years). The second group included beginners (n = 23, age - 9.78 ± 0.65 years). The functional asymmetry was determined using «Reaction SM Dual» software for tablets with iOS. Two visual tests were used. The duration of each test was 100 s. Each test was divided into 5 stages. Each stage lasts 20 s. The first test (simple reaction) – the participant pushes against the circles on the screen with two hands. The second test (differentiated reaction) – the participant pushes against the circles of the same color (out of five possible) on the screen. The following indicators were determined: the number of pushes with the right and left hand (abs); reaction time with the right and left hand (s); duration of pushes with the right and left hand (ms). It was estimated the following indicators: total number of pushes; average reaction time; average duration of pushes. Results are estimated using parametric and nonparametric statistical indicators. Results. The number of pushes in the test, the reaction rate, and the duration of pushes were significantly higher in experienced athletes. It was determined the asymmetry due to the lower duration of pushes with the right hand compared to the left hand in beginners. The asymmetry was not confirmed in experienced athletes. The reaction rate for the left hand significantly increased compared to stage 1 in beginners: at stage 2 (t = -2.41), at stage 3 (t = -2.23), at stage 4 (t = -2.30) and at stage 5 (t = -2.68). This dependency was less expressed for the right hand. It was confirmed the increase of the reaction rate in comparison with stage 1: at stage 3 (t = -2.39), at stage 4 (t = -2.00) and at stage 5 (t = -2.32). The differences in the dynamics of the test were more expressed in experienced athletes. It was determined the decrease in the number of pushes compared to stage 1: stage 2 (t = 2.53), stage 4 (t = 2.89) and stage 5 (t = 2.61). For the right hand, this pattern was more expressed. The decrease in the number of pushes was determined compared with stage 1: stage 2 (t = 2.17), stage 3 (t = 2.07), stage 4 (t = 2.39) and stage 5 (t = 2.94). Experienced athletes have confirmed significant changes in the reaction rate with their left hand compared to stage 1: stage 4 (t = -2.33) and stage 5 (t = -2.06). For the right hand, this pattern was confirmed only for the final stage of the test (t = -2.35). Conclusions. It was confirmed the legitimacy of using a special computer test to study functional asymmetry in students and schoolchildren practicing martial arts. The test division into several stages can significantly increase the information content of the results. The applied battery of indicators provides the necessary information for the analysis of asymmetry. It was determined the best functional condition of experienced athletes compared to beginners. Experienced athletes demonstrate the best ability to mobilize and concentrate on extreme conditions. The dynamics of the test also confirms the asymmetry in athletes with less training experience. Performing a test with a differentiated stimulus confirmed the revealed patterns. The lack of asymmetry in experienced athletes confirms optimal training tactics. The asymmetry in beginners stipulates the correction of training. Used computer test can be recommended for martial arts athletes’ condition monitoring."

https://openalex.org/W4246061980,Faculty Opinions recommendation of Effects of soccer heading on brain structure and function.,2020-06-26,2020,dataset,"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, with more than 265 million players worldwide, including professional and amateur ones.Soccer is unique in comparison to other sports, as it is the only sport in which participants purposely use their head to hit the ball.Heading is considered as an offensive or defensive move whereby the player's unprotected head is used to deliberately impact the ball and direct it during play.A soccer player can be subjected to an average of 6-12 incidents of heading the ball per competitive game, where the ball reaches high velocities.Moreover, in practice sessions, heading training, which involves heading the ball repeatedly at low velocities, is common.Although the scientific community, as well as the media, has focused on the effects of concussions in contact sports, the role of subconcussive impacts, as it can occur during heading, has recently gained attention, considering that it may represent an additional mechanism of cumulative brain injury.The purpose of this study is to review the existing literature regarding the effects of soccer heading on brain structure and function.Only in the last years, some investigations have addressed the impact of heading on brain structure, by using neuroimaging techniques.Similarly, there have been some recent studies investigating biochemical markers of brain injury in soccer players.There is evidence of association between heading and abnormal brain structure, but the data are still preliminary.Also, some studies have suggested that subconcussive head impacts, as heading, could cause cognitive impairment, whereas others have not corroborated this finding.Questions persist as to whether or not heading is deleterious to cognitive functioning.Further studies, especially with longitudinal designs, are needed to clarify the clinical significance of heading as a cause of brain injury and to identify risk factors.Such investigations might contribute to the establishment of safety guidelines that could help to minimize the risk of possible adverse effects of soccer on brain structure and function."

How does the development of this coordination solution depend on the structure of practice? Previously unpublished ground reaction force (GRF) data were analyzed to investigate the swing coordination changes that were associated with the changes in batting performance found in the training study by Gray (2017). From pre-post training, there were significant increases in the magnitude of correlations between adjacent swing phases, significant increases in good variability (changes that keep the swing within the required temporal constraint), significant decreases in bad variability (changes that move the swing outside the temporal constraint), and stronger evidence of online adjustments of the different swing phases. These effects were significantly larger for the virtual environment (VE) Adaptive group from the Gray (2017) study that had higher variability in practice conditions. Across all participants, there were significant correlations between the changes in good and bad variability from pre-post training and measures of batting from VE and real hitting tests, and statistics from league play. These findings suggest that baseball batters solve the problem of coordination by developing functional variability and coupling between swing phases (Katsumata, 2007), which can be facilitated by having more variability in practice conditions."

Method High-level athletes planned for arthroscopic treatment for FAIS were included prospectively in a Swedish hip arthroscopy registry between 2011 and 2017, and 717 met the inclusion criteria. Self-reported sporting activity was recorded preoperatively. The subjects answered PROMs, including the HSAS, iHOT-12 and HAGOS pre- and postoperatively. Results A total of 551 athletes (median age 26, interquartile range 20–34 years; 23% women) had completed follow-up PROMs, at mean 23.4 ± 7.2 months postoperatively. In total, 135 (24.5%) were active at their pre-injury level of sports at follow-up (RTS pre ). Athletes ≤30 years at time of surgery ( n = 366; median age 22 years) had higher rate of RTS pre (31.4%) compared with athletes &gt; 30 years ( n = 185; median age 40 years) (10.8%; p &lt; 0.001). All athletes had improvements in iHOT-12 and HAGOS, two years postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001), while RTS pre athletes reported significantly better PROMs, pre- and postoperatively, and had greater improvements two years postoperatively, compared with athletes not active at pre-injury level. Conclusion Only 25% of all high-level athletes and 31% of athletes ≤30 years were still active at their pre-injury sports level two years after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS. Athletes still active had significantly and clinically greater improvement regarding hip symptoms, function and quality of life, as compared with athletes not active at pre-injury level, two years postoperatively."

Sixty-four tendons were studied in 32 chickens, including 16 in the control group and 16 in the experimental group. The second and third finger flexor digitorum profundus tendons of the left foot of each chicken were repaired primarily after a full-thickness incision approximately 1 cm proximal to the distal adhesion area. In the control (n=32) and experimental groups (n=32), 0.25 mL of normal saline and 0.25 mL of 1% MB solutions were applied locally to the surgical site, respectively. The operated limb was immobilized using a circular cast. 16 chickens were randomly selected in each group and examined at the fourth week, and the remaining 16 chickens were examined at the sixth week. Thirty-two of these tendons were evaluated using the Tang histopathological adhesion classification system, and the other 32 were evaluated with a biomechanical pull system.Adhesion was found to be less in the experimental group compared to the control group at the end of the fourth and sixth weeks both histopathologically and biomechanically. Furthermore, adhesion was significantly less in the experimental group at the end of the sixth week compared to the fourth week both histopathologically and biomechanically.Histopathological and biomechanical results show that MB, which has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antimicrobial and antioxidant effects, reduces adhesion during the healing process after tendon repair. We think that local MB application, particularly in surgeries performed after this type of injury, will be beneficial on early rehabilitation and functional results."

The aim of this cohort comparison was to examine morphological, material, and mechanical properties of the patellar tendon and to extend earlier findings by measuring the ability to store and return elastic energy in symptomatic tendons.Seventeen patients with chronic (>3 months, VISA-P < 80), inferior pole patellar tendinopathy (24 ± 4 years; male = 12, female = 5) were carefully matched to controls (25 ± 3 years) for training status, pattern, and history of loading of the patellar tendon. Individual knee extension force, patellar tendon stiffness, stress, strain, Young's modulus, hysteresis, and energy storage capacity, were obtained with combined dynamometry, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyography.Anthropometric parameters did not differ between groups. VISA-P scores ranged from 28 to 78 points, and symptoms had lasted from 10 to 120 months before testing. Tendon proximal cross-sectional area was 61% larger in the patellar tendinopathy group than in the control group. There were no differences between groups in maximal voluntary isometric knee extension torque (p = 0.216; d < -0.31) nor in tensile tendon force produced during isometric ramp contractions (p = 0.185; d < -0.34). Similarly, tendon strain (p = 0.634; d < 0.12), hysteresis (p = 0.461; d < 0.18), and strain energy storage (p = 0.656; d < 0.36) did not differ between groups. However, patellar tendon stiffness (-19%; p = 0.007; d < -0.74), stress (-27%; p< 0.002; d < -0.90) and Young's modulus (-32%; p = 0.001; d < -0.94) were significantly lower in tendinopathic patients compared to healthy controls.In this study, we observed lower stiffness in affected tendons. However, despite the substantial structural and histological changes occurring with tendinopathy, the tendon capacity to store and dissipate energy did not differ significantly."

Thirty-nine fencer athletes participated to this study (age: 20.8 ± 3.0 years). They performed the new specific fencing COD test (SFCODT) on two separate occasions to establish its reliability. In addition, assessment of COD, jumping ability (i.e., squat jump, countermovement jump, five jump test), sprint time (e.g., 5-m, 10-m and 20-m), isokinetic concentric and eccentric quadriceps, and hamstring force tests were assessed. To establish SFCODT’s construct validity, two subgroups were identified based on their international and national fencing results: High- vs. low-ranked fencer athletes. Reliability, validity, and sensitivity of the SFCODT were established from the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measurement (TEM), smallest worthwhile change (SWC), and receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ICC of SFCODT was excellent at &gt;0.95, and the TEM was &lt; 5%. Based on the usefulness analysis, the ability to detect small performance changes can be rated as “good” in fencer athletes (SWC &gt; TEM). SFCODT was very largely associated with the COD test and moderate to very large associated with jumping ability, sprint time, and isokinetic strength. High-ranked fencer athletes were better than low-ranked fencer athletes on SFCODT (p &lt; 0.01). The area under the ROC curve was 0.76. In conclusion, the SFCODT is a highly reliable, valid, and sensitive test. Therefore, the SFCODT could be used by practitioners to evaluate specific CODS performance in fencer athletes."

These sensors have been also developed to assess athletes’ performance, providing useful guidelines for coaching, as well as for injury prevention. The data from these sensors provides key performance outcomes as well as more detailed kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data that provides insight into how the performance was obtained. From this perspective, inertial sensors, force sensors, and electromyography appear to be the most appropriate wearable sensors to use. Several studies were conducted to verify the feasibility of using wearable sensors for sport applications by using both commercially available and customized sensors. The present study seeks to provide an overview of sport biomechanics applications found from recent literature using wearable sensors, highlighting some information related to the used sensors and analysis methods. From the literature review results, it appears that inertial sensors are the most widespread sensors for assessing athletes’ performance; however, there still exist applications for force sensors and electromyography in this context. The main sport assessed in the studies was running, even though the range of sports examined was quite high. The provided overview can be useful for researchers, athletes, and coaches to understand the technologies currently available for sport performance assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3036129344,Measurement of lower-limb asymmetry in professional rugby league: a technical note describing the use of inertial measurement units,2020-06-23,2020,article,"Quantifying lower-limb load and asymmetry during team sport match-play may be important for injury prevention and understanding performance. However, current analysis methods of lower-limb symmetry during match-play employ wearable microtechnology that may not be best suited to the task. A popular microtechnology is global positioning systems (GPS), which are torso worn. The torso location, and the summary workload measures calculated by GPS are not suited to the calculation of lower-limb load. Instead, research grade accelerometers placed directly on the lower-limb may provide better load information than GPS. This study proposes a new technique to quantify external mechanical load, and lower-limb asymmetry during on-field team sport play using inertial measurement units.Four professional rugby league players (Age: 23.4 ± 3.1 years; Height: 1.89 ± 0.05 m; Mass: 107.0 ± 12.9 kg) wore two accelerometers, one attached to each foot by the boot laces, during match simulations. Custom Matlab (R2017b, The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA) code was used to calculate total time, area under the curve (AUC), and percentage of time (%Time) spent in seven acceleration categories (negative to very high, <0 g to >16 g), as well as minimum and maximum acceleration during match simulations. Lower-limb AUC and %Time asymmetry was calculated using the Symmetry Angle Equation, which does not require normalization to a reference leg.The range of accelerations experienced across all participants on the left and right sides were 15.68-17.53 g, and 16.18-17.69 g, respectively. Clinically significant asymmetry in AUC and %Time was observed for all but one participant, and only in negative (<0 g) and very high accelerations (>16 g). Clinically significant AUC differences in very high accelerations ranged from 19.10%-26.71%. Clinically significant %Time differences in negative accelerations ranged from 12.65%-25.14%, and in very high accelerations from 18.59%-25.30%. All participants experienced the most AUC at very low accelerations (2-4 g), and the least AUC at very high accelerations (165.00-194.00 AU vs. 0.32-3.59 AU). The %Time results indicated that all participants spent the majority of match-play (73.82-92.06%) in extremely low (0-2 g) to low (4-6 g) acceleration intensities, and the least %Time in very high accelerations (0.01%-0.05%).A wearable located on the footwear to measure lower-limb load and asymmetry is feasible to use during rugby league match-play. The location of the sensor on the boot is suited to minimize injury risk occurring from impact to the sensor. This technique is able to quantify external mechanical load and detect inter limb asymmetries during match-play at the source of impact and loading, and is therefore likely to be better than current torso based methods. The results of this study may assist in preparing athletes for match-play, and in preventing injury."

Body composition, Wingate anaerobic power test (WAnT), vertical jump, Illinois agility, handgrip strength and isokinetic leg strength measurements of the participants were carried out. SPSS 22.0 was used for data analysis and “Independent Samples T test” was used for comparing the data. Relative peak power (RPP) was as 12.04 W/kg, 11.41 W/kg in racket and futsal players respectively, at WAnT. And for the strength test, isokinetic extensor strength was measured as 220.61 Nm, and 217.40 Nm, isokinetic flexor strength as 134.82 Nm and 126.28 Nm. Dominant (D) and non-dominant (ND) handgrip strength measurements of the participants were detected as 51.51 kg/f and 49.58 kg/f in racket sports players, as 43.42 kg/f and 41.37 kg/f in futsal players respectively. The difference between these variables was found statistically significant only at D (p = .009) and ND (p = .004), handgrip strength parameters, the difference in other variables was not found significant. As a consequence, although WAnT, handgrip and isokinetic leg strength of racket sports players were found higher than futsal players, only the difference between handgrip strengths was statistically significant. This result showed us that there was no statistical difference between anaerobic strength parameters of racket and futsal players except for handgrip strengths."

Aim To describe the mechanisms, situational patterns and biomechanics (kinematics) of ACL injuries in professional male football matches. Methods We identified 148 consecutive ACL injuries across 10 seasons of professional Italian football. 134 (90%) injury videos were analysed for mechanism and situational pattern, while biomechanical analysis was possible in 107 cases. Three independent reviewers evaluated each video. ACL injury epidemiology (month), timing within the match and pitch location at the time of injury were also reported. Results 59 (44%) injuries were non-contact, 59 (44%) were indirect contact and 16 (12%) were direct contact. Players were frequently perturbed immediately prior to injury. We identified four main situational patterns for players who suffered a non-contact or an indirect contact injury: (1) pressing and tackling (n=55); (2) tackled (n=24); (3) regaining balance after kicking (n=19); and (4) landing from a jump (n=8). Knee valgus loading (n=83, 81%) was the dominant injury pattern across all four of these situational patterns (86%, 86%, 67% and 50%, respectively). 62% of the injuries occurred in the first half of the matches (p&lt;0.01). Injuries peaked at the beginning of the season (September–October) and were also higher at the end of the season (March–May). Conclusions 88% of ACL injuries occurred without direct knee contact, but indirect contact injuries were as frequent as non-contact injuries, underlying the importance of mechanical perturbation. The most common situational patterns were pressing, being tackled and kicking."

Evolving clinical and mechanistic evidences support the notation that chronic persistent MTBI related headaches (MTBI-HA) carry the hallmark characteristics of neuropathic pain. Thus, in addition to conventional treatment options applicable to non-traumatic primary headache disorders, other available treatment modalities for neuropathic pain should be considered. In this comprehensive review article, the author reveals the prevalence of MTBI-HA and its clinical manifestation, discusses existing clinical and mechanistic evidence supporting the classification of chronic persistent MTBI-HA as a neuropathic pain state, and explores current available treatment options and future directions of therapeutic research related to MTBI-HA."

It shows the lack of historical and contemporary policies in the IAAF to combat manipulation in its sport. The study draws on previously unexamined historical sources from the IAAF Archive in Monaco and the Carl and Liselott Diem-Archive in Germany, as well as recent reports compiled by official investigators. First, the paper discusses the IAAF's handling of result manipulation at the 1987 IAAF World Championships long jump competition. At this event, the result of the final jump of the Italian athlete Giovanni Evangelisti had been manipulated. The subsequent internal IAAF proceedings on the case revealed major inconsistencies and difficulties and these are analyzed here. The paper then compares the Evangelisti debacle with the IAAF's involvement in the recent doping scandal in Russia. Despite worldwide changes in the international sport system that led to the introduction of international governance principles and wide-ranging efforts against manipulation in sport, the available evidence suggests that there was conspiracy and corruption in the IAAF."

There are few studies analyzing the difference of spondylolysis among young athletes with different sports activity. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical factors and distribution of the lesions of spondylolysis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in young soccer and baseball players with symptomatic spondylolysis.<bold>Methods: </bold>The medical records of 178 young athletes aged 7 to 18 years old who underwent MRI to evaluate the cause of LBP between 2017 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with spondylolysis. Of the young athletes with symptomatic spondylolysis, clinical factors and MRI findings in soccer and baseball players were retrospectively evaluated. The clinical factors were age, sex, interval from onset of LBP to MRI, and side of the dominant leg in the sports field. MRI findings included number, lumbar level, and side of the lesions. <bold>Results: </bold>A total of 21 soccer players (mean age, 15.2 ± 1.4 years) and 38 baseball players (mean age, 15.1 ± 1.7 years) with symptomatic spondylolysis were enrolled. All patients were male. No significant differences were noted in age and the interval from onset of LBP to MRI between the groups. Soccer players had greater numbers of multiple (p = 0.005) and bilateral (p = 0.004) lesions than baseball players.

Humans have evolved a way of walking with high energy utilization, but it can be further improved. Drawing inspiration from the muscle-tendon unit, a passive spring-actuated ankle-foot exoskeleton is designed to assist with human walking and to lengthen walking duration by mechanically enhancing walking efficiency. Detection of the gait events is realized using a smart clutch, which is designed to detect the contact states between the shoe sole and the ground, and automatically switch its working state. The engagement of a suspended spring behind the human calf muscles is hence controlled and is in synchrony with gait. The device is completely passive and contains no external power source. Energy is stored and returned passively using the clutch. In our walking trials, the soleus electromyography activity is reduced by as much as 72.2% when the proposed ankle-foot exoskeleton is worn on the human body. The influence of the exoskeleton on walking habits is also studied. The results show the potential use of the exoskeleton in humans’ daily life."

The primary mechanism of injury of ACL was sports activity in 22 (68.5%) in total and it was 10 patients (62.4%) in patellar tendon group and 12 patients (75%) in hamstring tendon group Medial meniscus was injured in 7 (41.8%) patients in patellar tendon group and 5 (31.3%) patients in hamstring tendon group. Final results were evaluated using Lysholm's score and IKDC score. Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in the stability of the knee postoperatively in both the groups but there was no significant difference in the functional outcome between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon groups."

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases according to PRISMA method. The initial search identified 815 titles, resulting in 19 articles being included within the review. Original papers (English language) contained relevant data regarding rink hockey players’ performance or morphological/physiological demands, anthropometry/body composition characteristics were eligible. Studies were classified into categories: (1) Physiological Demands, (2) Anthropometry and Body Composition, (3) Game Characterization/Patterns, (4) Injuries. Results indicated that Rink hockey requires high intensity effort which demands both short and long duration efforts requirements from players. Body composition analysis shows to be an important monitoring tool which complements the understanding of the athlete’s cardiac adaptation. Game patterns shows a combination of specific game momentums with different outcomes according to the game zone. The intense short-term movements, collision and contact between players, in addition to the weight and speed of the hard ball and the stick, can considerably increase the risk of moderate and severe injuries. Lack of literature in Rink-Hockey is remarkable, and research is mainly focused on children and adolescents’ players. Furthermore, the existing research with adult elite athletes was assessed with a small sample size."
https://openalex.org/W3035103545,Features Observed Using Multiple Inertial Sensors for Running Track and Hard-Soft Sand Running: A Comparison Study,2020-06-15,2020,article,"Variability in the running surface can cause an athlete to alter their gait. Most literature report running on grass, a treadmill or athletics running tracks using inertial sensors. This study compares the signals obtained by 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) inertial-magnetic sensors incorporating an accelerometer (±16 g), gyroscope (±2000°/s) and magnetometer (±8 gauss). The sensors were placed on the participant's shank, knee, lower spine and upper spine, and the participants were asked to run on three different surfaces (running track, hard sand and soft sand). The calculated player loads for a 400 m run on each surface type was very similar. The mean and standard deviation values were 577 ± 130, 581 ± 128, 568 ± 124 for soft sand, hard sand and the running track, respectively. This did not correlate with the participant's self-assessment RPE (Rate of perceived exertion), which demonstrated running on soft sand to be significantly more challenging, yielding a mean and standard deviation of 5.3 ± 2.5 (Hard to Very Hard). Soft sand running had a decreased swing time duration but increased variability (0.44 ± 0.02 s—Swing Time, 6.5 ± 1.1%—CV), hard sand running had the longest swing and intermediate variability duration (0.46 ± 0.02 s—Swing Time, 3.30 ± 2.58 %—CV) and running track running had the medium swing time but lowest variability (0.45 ± 0.02 s, 2.7 ± 0.9%—CV). Gait dominance was not consistent across the surfaces for each participant and remained below a ratio of 0.4. These results provide an insight into how athletes modify their gait mechanics to accommodate different running surfaces."

Engineering a Virtual Lab for the Sports Sciences Using Wearables and IoT,2020-06-15,2020,article,"In tertiary education, disciplines such as sports science that require experimental components in their courses represent a significant challenge for online and distance education. This paper demonstrates the design and construction of an enriched experiment, together with the prototype software solution which can all be operated remotely using a web-based client. It presents research that investigated how to visualise data from internet of things (IoT) sensor devices (inertial sensor) used for tracking football sideline throw-ins. In this simple experiment, data was collected from one footballer, fitted with a single inertial sensor. A two-dimensional (2D) video, three-dimensional (3D) motion capture system and inertial sensor were all used to detect the release point of a sideline ball throw-in. In this project, inertial sensor data was used to create a 3D model using web graphical language and three.js."

The Frisbee was thrown at low angular velocities as the measurement limit of a single gyroscope was at 6.065 rps. The angular velocities of the triaxial gyroscope were analysed to study the attitude of a Frisbee before and after release. The angular velocities measured were post-processed and the following data were obtained: spin rate at release—3.9–6.14 rps; user-induced peak torque—0.483–0.9 Nm, and peak angular acceleration—204–358 rad/s2; and power input 7.53–19.56 W. The Frisbee wobbled at release which decreased during the flight due to a damping effect. This affected the spin decay, the reduction of wobble lead to a reduced drag force and thus to a smaller spin decay, which was initially 1.12–0.31 rev/s2 and then asymptoted to 0.11–0.01 rev/s2."

An increased amount of soft tissue injuries have been widely reported. A novel technique of determining the surface stiffness of beach sand in-situ used a simple drop-test penetrometer. The relationship between drop height and the depth of penetration squared was linear (Pearson's correlation coefficient r2 > 0.92). The stiffness ratio between the soft dry sand and ocean-saturated wet sand compacted by eight hours of coastal water exposure was approximately seven, which was similar to previously reported stiffness measurements in a sand box. However, the absolute stiffness values were much smaller. While this technique was manually operated, an automatic system is postulated for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3034569498,Defining the Individual Injury Profile of Recreational Runners: Integrating Off-Training and Subjective Factors into the Assessment of Non-Professional Athletes,2020-06-15,2020,article,"Non-professional runners make extensive use of consumer-available wearable devices and smartphone apps to monitor training sessions, health, and physical performance. Despite the popularity of these products, they usually neglect subjective factors, such as psychosocial stress, unexpected daily physical (in)activity, sleep quality perception, and/or previous injuries. Consequently, the implementation of these products may lead to underperformance, reduced motivation, and running-related injuries. This paper investigates how the integration of subjective training, off-training, and contextual factors from a 24/7 perspective might lead to better individual screening and health protection methods for recreational runners. Using an online-based Ecological Momentary Assessment survey, a seven-day cohort study was conducted. Twenty participants answered daily surveys three times a day regarding subjective off-training and contextual data; e.g., health, sleep, stress, training, environment, physiology, and lifestyle factors. The results show that daily habits of people are unstructured, unlikely predictable, and influenced by factors, such as the demands of work, social life, leisure time, or sleep. By merging these factors with sensor-based data, running-related systems would be able to better assess the individual workload of recreational runners and support them to reduce their risk of suffering from running-related injuries."

This study aimed to investigate joint torque in the lower limb that generates foot posture and swing trajectory, and compare three types of kicks before and after a practice period for participants to learn to control the ball rotation. An optical three-dimensional motion capture system was used to record the kicking motion of the participants. The results indicate that the adduction torque of the hip joint at the moment of impact decreased for curve kicks (from 0.56 to 0.25 Nm/kg) and increased for knuckle kicks (from −0.09 to 0.37 Nm/kg). We considered that the curve and knuckle kicks swing towards the inside (because of their positive values in the post experiment) with hip joint adduction before impact to control ball rotation."

An understanding of how humans can effectively and efficiently interact with technology, computers and other machines to improve sports performance is still being developed. As a consequence, the landscape in which the performance analyst now finds themselves has fundamentally changed. New, improved and different skill sets are now required in order to be impactful and experience sustained success. However, this growth also presents new opportunities to address difficult problems, including many that were previously considered intractable. This article lists ten essential adaptive tools for the contemporary performance analyst, many of which are useful in both research and applied sporting environments. A rationale for each is proposed, with an emphasis on ensuring that the performance analyst will be equipped to thrive in both current and future sport environments"
https://openalex.org/W3035452914,"Shoe-Integrated, Force Sensor Design for Continuous Body Weight Monitoring",2020-06-12,2020,article,"Traditional pedobarography methods use direct force sensor placement in the shoe insole to record pressure patterns. One problem with such methods is that they tap only a few points on the flat sole under the foot and, therefore, do not account for the total ground reaction force. As a result, body weight tends to be under-estimated. This disadvantage has made it more difficult for pedobarography to be used to monitor many diseases, especially when their symptoms include body weight changes. In this paper, the problem of pedobarographic body weight measurement is addressed using a novel ergonomic shoe-integrated sensor array architecture based on concentrating the applied force via three-layered structures that we call Sandwiched Sensor Force Consolidators (SSFC). A shoe prototype is designed with the proposed sensors and shown to accurately measure body weight with an achievable relative accuracy greater than 99%, even in the presence of motion. The achieved relative accuracy is at least 4X better than the existing state of the art. The SSFC shoe prototype is built using readily available soccer shoes and piezoresistive FlexiForce sensors. To improve the wearability and comfort of the instrumented shoe, a semi-computational sensor design methodology is developed based on an equivalent-area concept that can accurately account for SSFC’s with arbitrary shapes. The search space of the optimal SSFC design is shown to be combinatorial, and a high-performance computing (HPC) framework based on OpenMP parallel programming is proposed to accelerate the design optimization process. An optimal sensor design speedup of up to 22X is shown to be achievable using the HPC implementation."

Wearable and stretchable strain sensors have received extensive research interest due to their applications in personalized healthcare, human motion detection, human–machine interfaces, soft robotics, and beyond. The disconnection of overlapped nanomaterials, reversible opening/closing of microcracks in sensing films, and alteration of the tunneling resistance have been successfully adopted to develop high‐performance resistive‐type sensors. On the other hand, the sensing behavior of capacitive‐type and optical strain sensors is largely governed by their geometrical changes under stretching/releasing cycles. The sensor design parameters, including stretchability, sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, and dynamic durability, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the promising applications of wearable strain sensors are highlighted in detail. Although considerable progress has been made so far, wearable strain sensors are still in their prototype stage, and several challenges in the manufacturing of integrated and multifunctional strain sensors should be yet tackled."
https://openalex.org/W3034851860,Time-of-Day Effects on Short-Duration Maximal Exercise Performance,2020-06-11,2020,review,"Abstract Time-of-day dependent fluctuations in exercise performance have been documented across different sports and seem to affect both endurance and resistance modes of exercise. Most of the studies published to date have shown that the performance in short-duration maximal exercises (i.e. less than 1 min - e.g. sprints, jumps, isometric contractions) exhibits diurnal fluctuations, peaking between 16:00 and 20:00 h. However, the time-of-day effects on short duration exercise performance may be minimized by the following factors: (1) short exposures to moderately warm and humid environments; (2) active warm-up protocols; (3) intermittent fasting conditions; (4) warming-up while listening to music; or (5) prolonged periods of training at a specific time of day. This suggests that short-duration maximal exercise performance throughout the day is controlled not only by body temperature, hormone levels, motivation and mood state but also by a versatile circadian system within skeletal muscle. The time of day at which short-duration maximal exercise is conducted represents an important variable for training prescription. However, the literature available to date lacks a specific review on this subject. Therefore, the present review aims to (1) elucidate time-of-day specific effects on short-duration maximal exercise performance and (2) discuss strategies to promote better performance in short-duration maximal exercises at different times of the day."

Conclusion:The distance A (from 1 st toe to heel),distance D(metatarsal distance),distance C(length of the longitudinal arch contour) and distance G(narrowest distance of the foot) are increased in basketball players as compared to non playing individuals.Also the Arch index is more in basketball players which indicated a relatively flatter feet in basketball players as compared to non players.This indicates a flatter feet in basketball players as compared to non playing individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3033316777,Transitional fracture of the distal radius: a rare injury in adolescent athletes. Case series and literature review,2020-06-09,2020,review,"Abstract Background Transitional fractures are fractures in adolescents where partial closure of the epiphyseal growth plate has occurred. These fractures are most commonly reported in the distal tibia. With respect to the distal radius, only a few case reports describing transitional fractures exist. Furthermore, relatively little is known about epiphyseal closure of the distal radius. A case series of four transitional fractures of the distal radius is presented by comparing non-operative and operative treatment options. At present, this is the largest case series in the literature dealing with this rare injury. Case presentation We present three cases of four transitional fractures of the distal radius including 1–year follow-up. Patient age ranged from 16 to 18 years including a gender ratio of two males to one female. Clinical and radiographic assessments took place 6 and 12 weeks and 1 year after trauma/surgery. Three transitional fractures were treated with open reduction and internal volar plate fixation followed by functional rehabilitation. One transitional fracture was treated non-operatively. All cases showed an excellent functional outcome. Conclusions The primary treatment goal in transitional fractures is anatomic reduction of the articular surface. Non-operative treatment of transitional fractures of the distal radius is the most commonly reported treatment option. Additionally, different fixation options have been described, including the use of Kirschner wires (K-wires) and lag screws. The presented cases demonstrate that volar plate fixation followed by functional rehabilitation is a valuable treatment option in significantly displaced transitional fractures of the distal radius. Furthermore, we discuss the pathogenesis as well as the different treatment options by critical reviewing the literature."

There are limited data directly determining the risk of KR in ACL-injured patients. The purpose of this study is to estimate the risk of undergoing KR in patients with a history of primary ACL injury (ACLi).<bold>STUDY DESIGN:</bold> Systematic review.<bold>METHODS:</bold> A systematic literature search with keywords and MeSH terms was performed using PubMed and Cochrane Library. We identified all studies reporting KR as an outcome in individuals with primary ACLi. Individuals with concomitant and secondary intra-articular injuries were included. A modified version of the Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The risk was estimated by using the total number of ACL-injured patients and the total number of KRs within this cohort, consisting of both patients with reconstruction and patients with non-operative treatment.<bold>RESULTS:</bold> A total of 152 390 ACL-injured patients and a total of 1071 KRs were assembled from 5 prospective and 7 retrospective studies, which revealed a mean modified CMS of 70. Mean follow-up time was 16 years (ranging from 4.6 to 30 years). Mean age among the patients was 29.8 years. Estimated risk of undergoing KR after ACLi was 0.7 % with values between 0.54 % and 9.5 % among the included studies.<bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> This systematic review suggests an estimated risk of KR among ACL-injured patients to be 0.7 %. Our findings are based on the results from the included studies, which, to some degree, showed divergence. The discrepancy may be due to variability in several factors, both research variables and patient factors, including follow-up time, sample size, subsequent injuries, obesity, sex, age and activity level. No consensus about OA development after ACLi has been established, however, OA is a common topic in the conversation between the doctor and the patient. This data may be helpful for physicians and clinicians when informing patients about the long-term risk of symptomatic OA, eventually requiring KR."

Development of the former is in response to the growing issue of head impacts and concussion in rugby union. Testing was conducted in a vehicle safety laboratory using a standard impact protocol utilising the headforms of anthropometric testing devices. The headforms were subjected to controlled front and side impacts. For each impact, the linear acceleration and rotational velocity was measured over a 104-ms interval at a frequency of 1 kHz. The magnitude of peak linear acceleration and peak rotational velocity was determined from the measured time-series traces and statistically compared. The peak linear acceleration and rotational velocity had intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. The root-mean-square error between the measurement systems was 4.3 g with a standard deviation of 3.5 g for peak linear acceleration and 0.7 rad/s with a standard deviation of 0.4 rad/s for rotational velocity. Bland and Altman analysis indicated a systematic bias of 2.5 g and − 0.5 rad/s and limits of agreement (1.96 × standard deviation) of ± 13.1 g and ± 1.25 rad/s for the instrumented mouthguard. These results provide the basis on which the instrumented mouthguard can be further developed for deployment and application within professional rugby, with a view to accurately and reliably quantify head collision dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3033957386,The medial ligaments and the ACL restrain anteromedial laxity of the knee,2020-06-05,2020,article,"Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of each of the ACL and medial ligament structures in resisting anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI) loads applied in vitro. Methods Twelve knees were tested using a robotic system. It imposed loads simulating clinical laxity tests at 0° to 90° flexion: ±90 N anterior–posterior force, ±8 Nm varus–valgus moment, and ±5 Nm internal–external rotation, and the tibial displacements were measured in the intact knee. The ACL and individual medial structures—retinaculum, superficial and deep medial collateral ligament (sMCL and dMCL), and posteromedial capsule with oblique ligament (POL + PMC)—were sectioned sequentially. The tibial displacements were reapplied after each cut and the reduced loads required allowed the contribution of each structure to be calculated. Results For anterior translation, the ACL was the primary restraint, resisting 63–77% of the drawer force across 0° to 90°, the sMCL contributing 4–7%. For posterior translation, the POL + PMC contributed 10% of the restraint in extension; other structures were not significant. For valgus load, the sMCL was the primary restraint (40–54%) across 0° to 90°, the dMCL 12%, and POL + PMC 16% in extension. For external rotation, the dMCL resisted 23–13% across 0° to 90°, the sMCL 13–22%, and the ACL 6–9%. Conclusion The dMCL is the largest medial restraint to tibial external rotation in extension. Therefore, following a combined ACL + MCL injury, AMRI may persist if there is inadequate healing of both the sMCL and dMCL, and MCL deficiency increases the risk of ACL graft failure."

The major problem is sural nerve injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect and advantage of the intraoperative ultrasonography assistance for minimally invasive repair of the acute Achilles tendon rupture. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 36 cases of acute Achilles tendon rupture treated with minimally invasive repair assisted with intraoperative ultrasonography from January 2015 to December 2017. The relationship of the sural nerve and small saphenous vein was confirmed on the preoperative MRI. The course of the small saphenous vein and sural nerve were identified and marked by intraoperative ultrasonography. The ruptured Achilles tendon was repaired with minimally invasive Bunnell suture on the medial side of the small saphenous vein (SSV). Results: All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. No sural nerve injury or other complications was found intraoperatively and postoperatively. All the patients returned to work and light sporting activities at a mean of 12.78±1.40 weeks and 17.28±2.34 weeks, respectively. The Mean American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores improved from 59.17±5.31 preoperatively to 98.92±1.63 at the time of 12 months follow-up. There was statistically significant difference ( P &lt;0.001). No patient complained a negative effect on their life. Conclusions: The minimally invasive repair assisted with intraoperative ultrasonography can yield good clinical outcomes, less surgical time and less complications, especially sural nerve injury. It is an efficient, reliable and safe method for acute Achilles Tendon (AT) rupture."

Previous research suggests that the assessment of sport-specific technical skills is valuable for discriminating between more and less skilled individuals and/or for predicting future performance. Objective This review aims to provide an overview on both the instruments used to assess sport-specific technical skills and their discriminatory, explanatory and/or predictive findings in the context of TID. Methods Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Knowledge, SPORTDiscus, SURF and Scopus (January 1990–October 2019). Search terms covered the areas of sport, technical skills assessment, performance, skill level and youth. In the end, 59 relevant studies were identified and evaluated. Results The results highlight the widespread and important role of technical skills in TID; almost all studies (93%) reported discriminatory, explanatory and/or predictive benefits for the assessment of sport-specific technical skills. Analyzing and categorizing the number of assessment methods applied in the studies ( n = 69) according to their method type (‘technique-related’ or ‘outcome-related’ variables) and method set-up (‘experimental’ or ‘competition’ data acquisition environment) indicated a clear tendency towards ‘outcome-related’ (73%) and ‘experimental’ (75%) assessment methods. We also found a strong overrepresentation of studies assessing cross-sectional data (75%) in soccer (53%) in male samples (74% of studies reporting subjects’ sex) from European countries (64%). Conclusions On the one hand, our findings demonstrate the great capability of sport-specific technical skills assessments to discriminate different performance levels and predict future performance in TID activities. On the other hand, this review highlights the focus on ‘outcome-related’ and ‘experimental’ methods in specific populations and, consequently, the limited knowledge in other areas. Here, the application of ‘technique-related’ and ‘competition’ methods appears promising for adding new knowledge, especially in the light of technological advances."

Despite low back pain (LBP) represents the most common musculoskeletal disorder in population and in sports, there is currently sparse evidence about prevalence, incidence and risk factors for LBP among runners. The aims of this systematic review were to investigate among runners: prevalence and incidence of LBP and specific risk factors for the onset of LBP.A systematic review has been conducted according to the guidelines of the PRISMA statement. The research was conducted in the following databases from their inception to 31st of July 2019: PubMed; CINAHL; Google Scholar; Ovid; PsycINFO; PSYNDEX; Embase; SPORTDiscus; Scientific Electronic Library Online; Cochrane Library and Web of Science. The checklists of The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools were used to investigate the risk of bias of the included studies.Nineteen studies were included and the interrater agreement for full-text selection was good (K = 0.78; 0.61-0.80 IC 95%). Overall, low values of prevalence (0.7-20.2%) and incidence (0.3-22%) of LBP among runners were reported. Most reported risk factors were: running for more than 6 years; body mass index > 24; higher physical height; not performing traditional aerobics activity weekly; restricted range of motion of hip flexion; difference between leg-length; poor hamstrings and back flexibility.Prevalence and incidence of LBP among runners are low compared to the others running related injuries and to general, or specific population of athletes. View the low level of incidence and prevalence of LBP, running could be interpreted as a protective factor against the onset of LBP.PROSPERO CRD42018102001."
https://openalex.org/W3031282682,The epidemiology of kicking injuries in professional Rugby Union: A 15‐season prospective study,2020-06-03,2020,article,"Purpose While kicking in Rugby Union can be influential to match outcome, the epidemiology of kicking injuries remains unknown. This study therefore aimed to investigate the epidemiology of injuries attributed to kicking in professional rugby, including playing position‐specific effects and differences in kicking volumes and kick types. Methods Fifteen seasons of injury surveillance data and two seasons of match kicking characteristics from professional rugby players were analyzed. Incidence, propensity, and severity of kicking‐related injuries were calculated together with the locations and types of these injuries. Position‐related differences in match kicking types and volumes were also established. Results Seventy‐seven match and 55 training acute‐onset kicking injuries were identified. The match kicking injury incidence for backs was 1.4/1000 player‐match‐hours. Across all playing positions, the propensity for match kicking injury was 0.57 injuries/1000 kicks. Fly‐halves sustained the greatest proportion of match kicking injuries (47%) and performed the greatest proportion of match kicks (46%); an average propensity for match kicking injury (0.58/1000 kicks). Scrum‐halves executed 27% of match‐related kicks but had a very low propensity for match kicking injury (0.17/1000 kicks). All other positional groups executed a small proportion of match‐related kicks but a high propensity for match kicking injury. Ninety‐two percent of match kicking injuries occurred in the pelvis or lower limb, with the majority sustained by the kicking limb. 21% of all match kicking injuries were associated with the rectus femoris muscle. Conclusion Match kicking profiles and kicking injuries sustained are position‐dependent, which provides valuable insight for developing player‐specific conditioning and rehabilitation protocols."

The Fast-Fix device has undergone design changes to reduce deployment failure since its introduction in 2001. Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and mechanism of intra-operative deployment failure of the 3 rd generation Fast-fix 360™ (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, USA) device. Method Data was prospectively collected for 106 consecutive all-inside meniscal repairs undertaken with the Fast-fix 360™ device. Patient demographics, mechanism of failure, site and type of repair were recorded. Results 20 deployment failures occurred in 423 Fast-fix 360™ deployments, an incidence of 4.72%. Deployment failure occurred in 19 of 109 patients an incidence of 17.43%. Six different failure mechanisms occurred; anchor exiting device without trigger being initiated, anchors not holding in meniscus, both anchors simultaneously exiting device and braided suture failing. The most common failure mechanism was failure of the second anchor not holding in the meniscus. Average cost of device failure was $75 per patient. Conclusion Despite design modification, deployment failure still occurs with similar modes top to the original design."

A review of current literature and indications,2020-06-01,2020,review,"Introduction.Muscles lesions are common sport-related injuries.They are usually treated conservatively with good outcomes.However, large structural muscle injuries (type 4 according to I.S.Mu.L.T. classification) are a challenge for physicians.Often, patients may suffer from discomfort and residual pain, functional impairment, and the rate of complications and re-injury rate is high.Furthermore, the lack of clear indications does not help physicians in the decision process.Methods.We performed a systematic review of four databases (PubMed, Google scholar, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Metanalysis (PRISMA) guidelines.Level I (RCT), II, III and level IV studies (case series) were included.We also searched for biomechanical and animal studies.Results.Surgical repair of type IV muscle injuries seems to provide better outcomes and higher rate to return to sport than conservative treatment, although surgical repair is not supported by level I or II studies.The suture of the muscle fibers together with the epimysium increases the mechanical resistance of the suture and reduces the risk of pull-out.This technique allows earlier mobilization, promotes healing and reduces scar formation.Conclusions.In this article, we try to explain the rational to suture a closed muscle tear, summarize the proper surgical indications, and show the proper suture technique."

In the general population, incidence is approximately 33 per 100 000 people. Aim of the study The aim of the study was the evaluation of morphological changes in the musculus semitendinosus tendon used for the reconstruction of ACL to understand the quality of most common for surgery used material. Material and methods The materials were obtained from four ACL autologous hamstring reconstruction surgeries. The tissue was stained with hematoxyllin and eosin and with immunohistochemical (IMH) staining of PGP9.5, VEGF, collagen I and collagen III. The material was evaluated with semiquantitative method. Results Routine staining showed practically unchanged tendon structure, with one exception when sclerotic blood vessels were observed in endotenon. Collagen III IMH demonstrated moderate to numerous positive collagen fibres in two cases, but in other two there were only few positive structures seen. Collagen I IMH showed few to moderate number of positive collagen fibres in all cases. In two cases, moderate number of PGP9.5 positive nerve fibres was observed and in two other cases occasional to few number of positive structures was detected. PGP 9.5 marked higher number of nerve fibres in peritenon than in endotenon. Numerous VEGF positive endotheliocytes were observed in two cases, but in two other cases VEGF positive endotheliocytes were occasional. Conclusions Tendon of musculus semitendinosus displays two patterns of distribution of tissue ischemia, neuropeptide containing innervation and collagen I and III. Collagen III is thought to be evaluated as a response of tendon to the ischemia and intensive innervation, while increase of collagen I probably is related to the relatively unchanged vascularity and innervation. The pattern of musculus semitendinosus tendon structural changes seems to be connected to the individual homeostasis in patients persisting before the usage of tendon for the reconstruction."

Baseball players from the 2015-2019 seasons were included in the study (n=78; age=19.8±1.28). DXA scans performed at the start and end of season were analyzed and 3-day food records analyzed via ESHA software were utilized to assess dietary intake. Groups were stratified to examine differences in players’ positions (Pitchers vs. Position Players) and first-year status effects (Freshman/Transfer vs. Sophomore/Junior/Seniors). Based on the study’s findings, body mass and lean body mass significantly decreased from the beginning to end of season for the overall team (p= 0.002; 0.026). Position Players exhibited a significant decline in body mass, region percent fat, and fat mass (p=0.00, 0.014, and 0.021, respectively) while Pitchers did not demonstrate any significant changes. First-year players experienced an increase in visceral adipose tissue volume and visceral adipose tissue mass (p= 0.004, 0.004) and Sophomore/Junior/Seniors group experienced a significant decrease in body mass, region % fat, and fat mass from the beginning to end of season (p=0.00, 0.017, and 0.023, respectively). The team on average consumed 6% less than the recommended value for protein, 36% less than recommendation for carbohydrate and 10% above the recommended intake amount was determined for fat. Overall, the team consumed 18% less than their estimated total calorie recommended goal. We believe the study presents interesting findings that may be helpful for collegiate baseball programs, and potentially athletes in similar sports, to improve the performance, development and health of young student athletes."
https://openalex.org/W4381956856,Bracing versus non-bracing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery,2020-06-01,2020,article,"Background and objectives: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a common procedure which can allow patients to return to their active lifestyle. Knee braces have been prescribed frequently to protect the anterior cruciate ligament graft after reconstruction. The aim of this study was to see the effect of postoperative bracing with non-bracing after one year follow-up. Methods: Thirty consecutive patients with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture were reconstructed. The first 15 patients were supplied postoperatively with a knee brace for 6 weeks. The next 15 patients were not supplied with a brace. The follow-up was based on the Lysholm functional score, Tegner activity level, manual Lachman test and pain by visual analog scale, each variable were recorded before surgery, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and one year after the surgery. Results: After one year follow up, the results of this study showed no statistically significant differences between the brace and non-brace groups with regard to Lysholm score (mean with brace was 87.26, with- out brace was 87.80), Tegner activity level (mean with brace was 6.26, without brace was 6.40 ) and manual Lachman test; however, the pain score was less with brace group in the short term follow up (at 12th postoperative week) but no statistically significant differences was found between the groups after 1 year follow up. Conclusions: Weather using functional brace or not after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction depends on the orthopedic surgeon and the psychology and pain threshold of the patient."

However, the timeline-related diagnostics of maximal anaerobic glycolytic capacity remain unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a sprint running test to assess the anaerobic capacity.METHODS: The study was divided into three parts. Sixty-one male (24±4 years, 181.0±4.3 cm; 78.5±5.9 kg) and twelve female (25±3 years, 167.0±0.6 cm, 60.4±5.7 kg) sports students participated in this study. Twenty-five subjects (13 males, 24±2 years, 181.0±0.5 cm, 78.5±5.9 kg; 12 females, 25±3 years, 167.0±0.6 cm, 60.4±5.7 kg) performed incremental step tests at running track and several linear sprints on a running track (LSRT) with different time durations (8, 10, 12, and 14 seconds)(part I) on different days. Twenty-five male subjects (24±3 years, 180.7±6.7 cm, 84.6±8.8 kg) conducted a 10 or 12 second sprint running on a non-motorized treadmill (NMT)(part II). In part III, twenty-three male subjects (24±2 years, 181.4±5.8 cm, 74.5±7.4 kg) ran a 10 second LSRT and NMT on consecutive days. Capillary blood samplings were taken before (Lac&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and after the sprint running for ten minutes at one minute intervals to find out maximal lactate concentration after exercise and to calculate the maximum lactate production rate (LPR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;).RESULTS: For all parts reliability for LPR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was proven (Part I: 8 seconds: ICC: &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=.89; 10 seconds: ICC: &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=.82; 12 seconds: ICC: &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=.92; 14 seconds: &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=.84, respectively; Part II: 10 seconds: ICC: &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=.76; 12 seconds: ICC: &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;=.79).

Despite a successful return to sport (RTS) for most of the injured athletes, a significant proportion do not return to competitive levels, and thus RTS post ACL reconstruction still represents a challenge for clinicians. Wearable sensors, owing to their small size and low cost, can represent an opportunity for the management of athletes on-the-field after RTS by providing guidance to associated clinicians. In particular, this study aims to investigate the ability of a set of inertial sensors worn on the lower-limbs by rugby players involved in a change-of-direction (COD) activity to differentiate between healthy and post-ACL groups via the use of machine learning. Twelve male participants (six healthy and six post-ACL athletes who were deemed to have successfully returned to competitive rugby and tested in the 5–10 year period following the injury) were recruited for the study. Time- and frequency-domain features were extracted from the raw inertial data collected. Several machine learning models were tested, such as k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, gradient boosting tree, multi-layer perceptron, and stacking. Feature selection was implemented in the learning model, and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) was adopted to estimate training and test errors. Results obtained show that it is possible to correctly discriminate between healthy and post-ACL injury subjects with an accuracy of 73.07% (multi-layer perceptron) and sensitivity of 81.8% (gradient boosting). The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using body-worn motion sensors and machine learning approaches for the identification of post-ACL gait patterns in athletes performing sport tasks on-the-field even a number of years after the injury occurred."

The aim of this study was to use systematic video analysis to determine the MoI of a patella dislocation.A systematic search was conducted of three video sharing websites and three popular search engines to identify videos demonstrating a patellar dislocation. Videos were reviewed by three surgeons trained in systematic video analysis, who commented on the position of the lower limb and the situation in which the injury occurred. The results were reviewed to build a consensus of the MoI for each video. Statistical analysis was conducted for interobserver agreement (p < 0.05).Initial search yielded 603 videos with 13 meeting the inclusion criteria. The injuries were sustained performing a sporting activity (n = 9) or whilst dancing (n = 4). The injury was predominantly sustained during a non-contact situation (n = 10). The most common mechanism was an unbalanced individual with a flexed hip sustaining a valgus force to their flexed knee with the tibia externally rotated.This study provides some insight into the MoI for a patellar dislocation and the findings may assist in developing injury prevention programmes and rehabilitation protocols as well as guiding future research."
https://openalex.org/W3032663075,Bowled over or over bowled? Age-related changes in the performance of bowlers in Test match cricket,2020-05-27,2020,preprint,"ABSTRACT Data from elite professional sports players provide a valuable source of information on human performance and ageing. Functional declines in performance have been investigated across a wide range of sporting disciplines that vary in their need for physical strength, endurance, cognitive ability and motor skills, but rarely have researchers considered other sources of heterogeneity that can exist among individuals. Using information on all male bowlers to have played Test match cricket since the early 1970s, I separated age-dependent variation in bowling performance at the population-level into within-individual and between-individual (cohort) changes. I found no evidence for senescence in bowling performance as measured via economy rate or wicket-taking ability, irrespective of the style of the bowler (fast or slow). Instead, analyses detected strong between-individual contributions to bowling performance as higher quality bowlers were able to compete at the elite level for longer, and were therefore over-represented in older age classes. Bowlers also experienced a deterioration in the last year of their Test careers. These results highlight that the very best Test match bowlers have been able to maintain and often improve their skill level well into their thirties, but how they accomplish this alongside the physical demands of Test cricket remains unresolved. Further multivariate models also identified a negative relationship among slow bowlers between their economy rate and their wicket-taking ability, suggesting that in general, the most economical slow bowlers in the modern era of Test match cricket have also taken wickets at the fastest rate. The same is not true for fast bowlers, which is perhaps partly because bowling at high speed compromises accuracy and thus increases scoring opportunities for batsman."

Neuromuscular training programs that aim to reduce this injury by targeting the associated biomechanical movements are a potential solution. While previous studies have examined the lack of dynamic knee control during landing, there are few that outline the role that maturation can play during unanticipated cutting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if young female soccer players across multiple phases of maturation exhibited the before seen differences in knee control during a drop landing as well as an unanticipated cutting task. 139 female soccer players volunteered to participate in this study and were classified in three maturational groups based on percent adult stature: prepubertal (PRE), pubertal (PUB), and post-pubertal (POST). Each group performed a drop vertical jump (DVJ) and an unanticipated cutting task (CUT). Standard 3D motion capture techniques were used to determine peak knee flexion/abduction angles and moments during each task. Within tasks, POST exhibited significantly greater peak abduction angles and moments compared to PUB/PRE. While each maturational group exhibited greater peak knee abduction angles during the DVJ compared to the CUT, peak knee abduction moments during the CUT were greater compared to the DVJ. Participants within each maturational group exhibited greater knee flexion during the DVJ compared to the CUT, however there were no differences identified between groups. During both tasks, POST/PUB exhibited greater peak knee flexion moments compared to PRE, as well as POST compared to PUB. Overall, each group exhibited significantly greater peak knee flexion moments during the CUT compared to the DVJ. These observed differences indicate the need for neuromuscular training programs that target both jumping and cutting techniques to reduce ACL injuries."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the reciprocal associations between PA and use of alcohol among former athletes and controls at four time points. Furthermore, we examined whether there were longitudinal latent profiles related to use of alcohol, smoking and PA during the follow‐up. Finnish male former elite athletes ( n = 1633) and matched controls ( n = 1099) questionnaire‐reported their PA, alcohol consumption and smoking at four time points in 1985, 1995, 2001 and 2008. Former athletes were more physically active and smoked less than controls, but in all profiles smoking decreased during the follow‐up. Former athletes consumed alcohol significantly more compared to controls in 1985, especially if their athletic career had ended suddenly by sports injury. At other time points, no differences were seen. Five latent profiles were found, and there were significant differences between former athletes and controls in the probabilities to belong to four of them. PA decreased in four of five profiles, while alcohol consumption decreased or increased in some profiles. But PA did not predict later alcohol consumption at any time point. Cross‐lagged path model indicated that the mutual associations of alcohol use and PA were weak at most. Although risk of excessive alcohol consumption may increase in individuals, whose athletic career has ended suddenly by sports injury, overall PA and alcohol affected each other's development only modestly among former athletes and controls during the 23‐year follow‐up."

The aim of this narrative review is to review the scientific literature regarding the difference between the sexes for all swimming strokes (i.e., butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle and individual medley), different distances (i.e., from sprint to ultra-distances), extreme conditions (i.e., cold water), different ages and swimming integrated in multi-sports disciplines, such as triathlon, in various age groups and over calendar years. The influence of various physiological, psychological, anthropometrical and biomechanical aspects to potentially explain the female dominance was also discussed. The data bases Scopus and PUBMED were searched by April 2020 for the terms ’sex–difference–swimming’. Long-distance open-water swimmers and pool swimmers of different ages and performance levels were mainly investigated. In open-water long-distance swimming events of the ’Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming’ with the ’Catalina Channel Swim’, the ’English Channel Swim’ and the ’Manhattan Island Marathon Swim’, women were about 0.06 km/h faster than men. In master swimmers (i.e., age groups 25–29 to 90–94 years) competing in the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Championships in pool swimming in freestyle, backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke, individual medley and in 3000-m open-water swimming, women master swimmers appeared able to achieve similar performances as men in the oldest age groups (i.e., older than 75–80 years). In boys and girls aged 5–18 years—and listed in the all-time top 100 U.S. freestyle swimming performances from 50 m to 1500 m—the five fastest girls were faster than the five fastest boys until the age of ~10 years. After the age of 10 years, and until the age of 17 years, however, boys were increasingly faster than girls. Therefore, women tended to decrease the existing sex differences in specific age groups (i.e., younger than 10 years and older than 75–80 years) and swimming strokes in pool-swimming or even to overperform men in long-distance open-water swimming (distance of ~30 km), especially under extreme weather conditions (water colder than ~20 °C). Two main variables may explain why women can swim faster than men in open-water swimming events: (i) the long distance of around 30 km, (ii) and water colder than ~20 °C. Future studies may investigate more detailed (e.g., anthropometry) the very young (&lt;10 years) and very old (&gt;75–80 years) age groups in swimming"
https://openalex.org/W3027096046,Return to Sport after Anatomic and Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty in Elderly Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020-05-22,2020,review,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the rate of return to sport in elderly patients who underwent anatomic (ATSA) and reverse (RTSA) total shoulder arthroplasty, to assess postoperative pain and functional outcomes and to give an overview of postoperative rehabilitation protocols. A systematic search in Pubmed-Medline, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was carried out to identify eligible randomized clinical trials, observational studies, or case series that evaluated the rate of return to sport after RTSA or ATSA. Six retrospective studies, five case series, and one prospective cohort study were included in this review. The overall rate of return to sport was 82% (95% CI 0.76–0.88, p &lt; 0.01). Patients undergoing ATSA returned at a higher rate (90%) (95% CI 0.80–0.99, p &lt; 0.01) compared to RTSA (77%) (95% CI 0.69–0.85, p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the results showed that patients returned to sport at the same or a higher level in 75% of cases. Swimming had the highest rate of return (84%), followed by fitness (77%), golf (77%), and tennis (69%). Thus, RTSA and ATSA are effective to guarantee a significative rate of return to sport in elderly patients. A slightly higher rate was found for the anatomic implant."
https://openalex.org/W3032135332,Isokinetic back training is more effective than core stabilization training on pain intensity and sports performances in football players with chronic low back pain,2020-05-22,2020,article,"Abstract Background: Isokinetic training (IKT) and core stabilization training (CST) are commonly used for balance training in musculoskeletal conditions. The knowledge about the effective implementation of these training protocols on sports performances in university football players with chronic low back pain (LBP) is lacking. Objective: To find and compare the effects of IKT and CST on sports performances in university football players with chronic LBP. Design: Randomized, double-blinded controlled study. Setting: University hospital. Participants: Sixty LBP participants divided into isokinetic group (IKT; n = 20), core stabilization group (CST; n = 20), and the control group (n = 20) and received respected exercises for 4 weeks. Outcome measures: Clinical (pain intensity and player wellness) and sports performances (40 m sprint, 4 × 5 m sprint, submaximal shuttle running, counter movement jump, and squat jump) scores were measured at baseline, after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months. Results: Four weeks following training IKT group shows more significant changes in pain intensity and player wellness scores than CST and control groups ( P ≤ .001). Sports performance variables (40 m sprint, 4 × 5 m sprint, submaximal shuttle running, counter movement jump and squat jump) scores also show significant improvement in IKT group than the other 2 groups ( P ≤ .001). Conclusion: This study suggests that training through IKT improves pain intensity and sports performances than CST in university football players with chronic LBP."
https://openalex.org/W3100895589,An anatomically accurate and personalizable head injury model: Significance of brain and white matter tract morphological variability on strain,2020-05-22,2020,preprint,"Abstract Finite element head (FE) models are important numerical tools to study head injuries and develop protection systems. The generation of anatomically accurate and subject-specific head models with conforming hexahedral meshes remains a significant challenge. The focus of this study is to present two developmental work: First, an anatomically detailed FE head model with conforming hexahedral meshes that has smooth interfaces between the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid, embedded with white matter (WM) fiber tracts; Second, a morphing approach for subject-specific head model generation via a new hierarchical image registration pipeline integrating Demons and Dramms deformable registration algorithms. The performance of the head model is evaluated by comparing model predictions with experimental data of brain-skull relative motion, brain strain, and intracranial pressure. To demonstrate the applicability of the head model and the pipeline, six subject-specific head models of largely varying intracranial volume and shape are generated, incorporated with subject-specific WM fiber tracts. DICE similarity coefficients for cranial, brain mask, local brain regions, and lateral ventricles are calculated to evaluate personalization accuracy, demonstrating the efficiency of the pipeline in generating detailed subject-specific head models achieving satisfactory element quality without further mesh repairing. The six head models are then subjected to the same concussive loading to study sensitivity of brain strain to inter-subject variability of the brain and WM fiber morphology. The simulation results show significant differences in maximum principal strain (MPS) and axonal strain (MAS) in local brain regions (one-way ANOVA test, p&lt;0.001), as well as their locations also vary among the subjects, demonstrating the need to further investigate the significance of subject-specific models. The techniques developed in this study may contribute to better evaluation of individual brain injury and development of individualized head protection systems in the future. This study also contains general aspects the research community may find useful: on the use of experimental brain strain close to or at injury level for head model validation; the hierarchical image registration pipeline can be used to morph other head models, such as smoothed-voxel models."

And although chiropractors can claim some penetration as health care service providers in high level sport, their position as valued members of interprofessional health care teams, especially those built around traditional medical organisational structures, is unclear. In Denmark, the mainstream provider status of chiropractors is more favourable than in most parts of the world. Moreover, chiropractors have been identified as service providers in the Danish premiere football league (Super Liga). However, little is currently known about the professional contribution made by chiropractors in this powerful sporting context.As a first step to map the professional practice landscape of Danish sports chiropractors, this investigation sought to explore the perceived role and perceived value of chiropractors as service providers in elite Danish football clubs. <bold>Methods:</bold> A comparative qualitative case study using semi-structured individual interviews was conducted. Six Danish Superliga clubs were purposively sampled to compare and contrast instances where chiropractors were absent from the health care team, contracted as in-house health care team members or engaged as external service providers. Triangulated responses were solicited from healthcare co-ordinators, chiropractors and athletes within each club’s organisation through short semi-structured individual interviews. The audio-recorded responses were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using a framework approach.<bold>Results:</bold> Inductive and deductive coding revealed 14 unique codes, which were further organised into 4 code families relating to the role of chiropractors, benefits of utilizing chiropractic care and facilitators and barriers to interprofessional practice. From this framework 3 themes were abstracted, these being: “Broadening horizons”, “In-house preferred to take-away” and “Already covered, or even necessary?”. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this practice context, chiropractors fill the role of musculoskeletal health care service providers. Their perceived value stems from additional expert disciplinary knowledge, improved diagnostic triage and increased treatment flexibility. However, where not utilized, the role of the spinal health expert is questioned and when acknowledged, limited to that of a technician/therapist. It is unclear whether chiropractors can claim core team member status. Further exploration of this interesting context of IPP practice is warranted."

Methods This study included 27 participants with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis. Cross-sectional area of hip muscles, including psoas major, rectus femoris, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and minimus, adductor longus and magnus, obturator internus, and obturator externus, were measured from magnetic resonance images. Hip pain and function were evaluated using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) categorised into 5 subscales: pain, symptoms, activity of daily living, sport and recreation function, and hip-related quality of life (for each subscale 0 representing extreme problems and 100 representing no problems). Results Mean age of the 27 participants was 63.2 (SD 7.6) years and 66.7% ( n = 18) were female. After adjusting for age and gender, greater cross-sectional area of adductor longus and magnus was associated with a higher HOOS score in quality of life (regression coefficient 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2–2.7, p = 0.02), activity of daily living (regression coefficient 1.3, 95% CI 0.1–2.6, p = 0.04) and sport and recreation function (regression coefficient 1.6, 95% CI 0.1–3.0, p = 0.04). There was a trend towards an association between greater cross-sectional area of psoas major and a higher quality of life score (regression coefficient 3.6, 95% CI − 0.5 to 7.7, p = 0.08). The cross-sectional area of hip muscles was not significantly associated with HOOS pain or symptom score. Conclusion Greater cross-sectional area of hip adductors was associated with better function and quality of life in individuals with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis. Greater cross-sectional area of hip flexors might be associated with better quality of life. These findings, while need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies, suggest that targeting the hip adductor and flexor muscles may improve function and quality of life in those with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis."

Video analysis is an important tool to recognize traumatic brain injury (TBI), including sports-related concussions, among football players. Aim To report the characteristics of TBI among football players in 2017 Brazilian Series A Football Championship and to discuss the evaluation protocols of football players with concussion. Methods This is an observational study concerning video analysis of all matches on 2017 Series A Brazilian Football Championship. The videos were first analyzed by a team of 10 trained medical students. All suspected TBIs were reviewed by the research’s coordinator. Concussion diagnosis was defined by one of the following events: lying motionless, loss of responsiveness, impact seizure, disorientation and motor incoordination. The length of sideline medical assessment was systematically recorded. Results In a whole of 380 matches, it was verified 374 TBIs. The most common etiology was “head-to-head” impact. Twelve players were replaced after TBI. Thirteen players (3,5% of TBIs) had concussion, but only four of them were replaced. The overall mean time for medical assessment was 1’35” (range: 48” to 7’40”). Considering the twelve players who had a concussion and the thirteen players who were replaced, the mean time for medical evaluation was 3’19” and 3’26”, respectively. Conclusion This study confirms that there is a gap between formal protocols for concussion assessment on sideline in Brazilian Elite Football and current medical practices. It also discusses changes on football rules of player replacement to an adequate sideline medical evaluation."

This article outlines challenges that may restrict the optimal balance between training and recovery and provide solutions to help practitioners overcome these challenges. To facilitate positive youth athletic development, training aims must be aligned between stakeholders to synchronize periods of intensified training and recovery. Within- and between-athlete variations in weekly training load must be managed and practitioners should attempt to ensure the intended load of training equals the load perceived by the athlete. Furthermore, practitioners should be cognizant of the athletes' nonsport-related stressors to enable both academic and sporting pursuits. Although each of these challenges adds intricacy, they may be overcome through collaboration, monitoring, and, if necessary, the modification of the athletes' training load."

Head impacts are of concern because of the potential adverse health effects. Many elite players now wear GPS (that include inertial monitoring units) on the upper spine for location tracking and workload measurement. By measuring the maximum acceleration of the head and the upper spine, we calculated the acceleration ratio as an attenuation index for participants (n = 8) of different skill levels during a front heading activity. This would allow for in-field estimates of head impacts to be made and concussive events detected. For novice participants, the ratio was as high as 8.3 (mean value 5.0 ± 1.8), whereas, for experienced players, the mean ratio was 3.2 ± 1.5. Elite players stiffen the neck muscles to increase the ball velocity and so the torso acts as a support structure. Electromyography (EMG) signals that were recorded from the neck and shoulder before and after a training intervention showed a major increase in mean average muscle activity (146%, p = 3.39 × 10−6). This was accompanied by a major decrease in acceleration ratio (34.41%, p = 0.008). The average head-ball impact velocity was 1.95 ± 0.53 m/s determined while using optical motion capture. For this low velocity, the impact force was 102 ± 19 N, 13% of the published concussive force. The voluntary action of neck muscles decreases isolated head movements during heading. Coaches and trainers may use this evidence in their development of junior players."
https://openalex.org/W3024663210,"Mechanisms of Hamstring Strain Injury: Interactions between Fatigue, Muscle Activation and Function",2020-05-18,2020,review,"Isolated injury to the long head of biceps femoris is the most common type of acute hamstring strain injury (HSI). However, the precise hamstring injury mechanism (i.e., sprint-type) is still not well understood, and research is inconclusive as to which phase in the running cycle HSI risk is the greatest. Since detailed information relating to hamstring muscle function during sprint running cannot be obtained in vivo in humans, the findings of studies investigating HSI mechanisms are based on modeling that requires assumptions to be made based on extrapolations from anatomical and biomechanical investigations. As it is extremely difficult to account for all aspects of muscle-tendon tissues that influence function during high-intensity running actions, much of this complexity is not included in these models. Furthermore, the majority of analyses do not consider the influence of prior activity or muscular fatigue on kinematics, kinetics and muscle activation during sprinting. Yet, it has been shown that fatigue can lead to alterations in neuromuscular coordination patterns that could potentially increase injury risk. The present critical review will evaluate the current evidence on hamstring injury mechanism(s) during high-intensity running and discuss the interactions between fatigue and hamstring muscle activation and function."

Aim: This study identifies: (i) age-at-peak height velocity (APHV), (ii) physical performance spurt patterns aligned to APHV; and (iii) cross-cultural and time patterns in Canadian, Brazilian and Portuguese boys. Subjects and methods: A total of 512 boys (131 Canadian, 250 Portuguese and 131 Brazilian), 8–17 years of age were followed serially using longitudinal data. APHV was identified and five physical performance measures velocities [trunk extension (TE), trunk flexion (TF), standing long jump (SLJ), curl-ups (CU) and handgrip strength (HG)] were aligned at 6-month intervals, 4 years around the attainment of PHV. Velocities were estimated using a non-smooth mathematical procedure. Results: APHV was 13.9 ± 1.0, 13.4 ± 1.6 and 13.0 ± 0.8 years for Canadian, Brazilian and Portuguese boys, respectively. Maximal velocity in SLJ was attained between 12 and 6 months prior to PHV. For HG, peaks were attained 12–24 months after PHV. Maximal velocity in TE occurred between 12 and 0 months prior to PHV, while CU peaked between PHV and 6 months after PHV. Conclusion: Patterns of spurts in physical performance have remained relatively the same and do not appear to be influenced by cross-cultural differences."

Therefore, various methods have been reported for the extraction of nails after femoral refracture. We want to share our successful treatment. Patient concerns: Case 1. A 44-year-old man was admitted to our clinic after falling while playing soccer. He complained severe right thigh pain with a visible deformity of the femur. His medical history revealed a right femoral shaft fracture caused in a traffic accident which had been treated with intramedullary nailing. Case 2. A 27-year-old man, who had suffered a right femur fracture after a motorcycle accident and been treated with an IM nail, presented after falling down the stairs. He had severe right thigh pain without any open wound or neurologic deficit. Diagnosis: Case 1. Plain radiographs revealed a refracture of the right femoral shaft and a bent IM nail. The initial varus deformity of the nail was 60.1° in the coronal plane. Case 2. The valgus deformity of the nail was 16.1° with an apex-posterior angulation of 34.8° in the sagittal image of plain radiographs. Interventions: Case 1. Initial manual reduction was tried in emergency room. Then, under general anesthesia closed reduction of the fracture and bent IM nail was done. After closed reduction, the nail was straightened and extracted smoothly. Case 2. Closed manipulation was attempted initially. But no difference in the deformity was achieved. Therefore, via skin incision, the bent nail was progressively sectioned with high-speed cutting burr until the nail could be straightened. Outcomes: Case 1. The patient was mobilized with partial-weight bearing assisted with a crutch on postoperative day two. One year after surgery, the fracture union was complete and the patient was pain-free. Case 2. Six months after surgery, the fracture union was complete with sufficient callus formation around the fracture site. Conclusion: There is no gold standard method to remove a bent IM nail. However, since manual reduction to straighten the bent nail causes minimal soft tissue damage, it should be considered first. If it fails, other methods should be attempted, progressing from the minimally invasive technique to more invasive methods."

Drawing on data from a larger 4-year ethnographic study, we focus on the motivations and meanings of five athletes who had become disabled due to spinal cord injury (SCI) for tattooing their bodies in specific ways. Our analysis illuminates the following key themes as being significant in the body modification choices of those involved: re-inscribing identity, subverting the ableist stare and embodying disability pride, articulating gendered sexuality, and enabling the process of narrative mapping between pre- and post-spinal cord injury periods. In considering these themes we reveal some important contrasts between ablebodied and disabled forms of engagement with body modification practices."
https://openalex.org/W3024220387,Effect of Football Shoe Collar Type on Ankle Biomechanics and Dynamic Stability during Anterior and Lateral Single-Leg Jump Landings,2020-05-13,2020,article,"In this study, we investigated the effects of football shoes with different collar heights on ankle biomechanics and dynamic postural stability. Fifteen healthy college football players performed anterior and lateral single-leg jump landings when wearing high collar, elastic collar, or low collar football shoes. The kinematics of lower limbs and ground reaction forces were collected by simultaneously using a stereo-photogrammetric system with markers (Vicon) and a force plate (Kistler). During the anterior single-leg jump landing, a high collar shoe resulted in a significantly smaller ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), compared to both elastic (p = 0.031, dz = 0.511) and low collar (p = 0.043, dz = 0.446) types, while also presenting lower total ankle sagittal ROM, compared to the low collar type (p = 0.023, dz = 0.756). Ankle joint stiffness was significantly greater for the high collar, compared to the elastic collar (p = 0.003, dz = 0.629) and low collar (p = 0.030, dz = 1.040). Medial-lateral stability was significantly improved with the high collar, compared to the low collar (p = 0.001, dz = 1.232). During the lateral single-leg jump landing, ankle inversion ROM (p = 0.028, dz = 0.615) and total ankle frontal ROM (p = 0.019, dz = 0.873) were significantly smaller for the high collar, compared to the elastic collar. The high collar also resulted in a significantly smaller total ankle sagittal ROM, compared to the low collar (p = 0.001, dz = 0.634). Therefore, the high collar shoe should be effective in decreasing the amount of ROM and increasing the dynamic stability, leading to high ankle joint stiffness due to differences in design and material characteristics of the collar types."

However, biomechanical data of human Achilles tendons after rupture during the separate healing stages are unknown. Shear wave elastography is an ultrasound technique that measures material elastic properties non-invasively, and was proven to have a very good correlation to biomechanical studies. Taking advantage of this technology, 12 patients who suffered from an acute Achilles tendon rupture were acquired and monitored through the course of one year after rupture. Nine of these patients were treated non-operatively and were included for the analysis of biomechanical behaviour. A significant increase of material elastic properties was observed within the first six weeks after trauma (up to 80% of baseline value), where it reached a plateau phase. A second significant increase occurred three to six months after injury. This pilot study suggests a time correlation of biomechanical properties with the biological healing phases of tendon tissue. In the reparative phase, a substantial amount of biomechanical resilience is restored already, but the final stage of biomechanical stability is reached in the maturation phase. These findings can potentially be implemented into treatment and aftercare protocols."

To analyse the intervention’s effectiveness, the study applied latent growth curve modelling. Moreover, we tested whether work-related and personal resources (i.e., job control and self-efficacy) moderated the intervention’s effectiveness and whether an increase in number of steps was associated with an improvement in impaired well-being. During the intervention, data were collected at six measurement points from 108 mainly low active employees. The results revealed that employees increased their number of steps until the second intervention week; this increase was not moderated by job control or self-efficacy. Moreover, the intervention was effective in decreasing emotional strain and negative affect over the course of the intervention. Further analyses showed that the increase in number of steps was related to the decrease in negative affect, whereas no such association was found for the increase in number of steps and the decrease in emotional strain. In conclusion, the findings showed that our intervention was effective in improving physical activity and impaired well-being among employees."

To restore the biological space, intentional replantation may be chosen when other immediate treatment options are not viable. Intentional replantation with tooth rotation consists of extraction, 180° rotation and replantation, thereby maintaining the biological width. This article presents management of a maxillary central incisor with complicated crown root fracture with open apex. The tooth was rotated and splinted for one week. The apex was closed with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) followed by obturation and post placement. The incompletely obturated adjacent tooth was non-surgically managed by retreatment. Finally, glass fibre post followed by crown with indirect composite built up was made. Patient was followed up every three months for the next two years without any complications."

This study aims to investigate the association of postural balance with traits of personality and temperament. The differences between elite athletes, football players, and the control sample will also be examined. <bold>Methods</bold>: Participants in the case-control study were 73 people, aged between 16 and 30 years old (M = 21.29, SD = 2.47), including 59% of men. Three samples of participants consisted of Elite Athletes (AE, n = 17, 23.29%) of the Polish National Team; Football Players (FP, n = 32, 43.84%); and Control Sample (CS, n = 24, 32.88%). Postural control was assessed on a force platform (Type 9286AA, Kistler Instrument AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The center of pressure (COP) parameters was measured during 20 seconds in both conditions eye open, and eye closed, in both directions anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML). The COP parameters include standard deviation (SD), mean range (RA), mean velocity (MV), and entropy (SE). The NEO-FFI questionnaire was used to assess Big-Five personality traits, whereas the FCB-TI was used to measure temperament traits. <bold>Results</bold>: One-way ANOVA revealed that the EA and CS groups were more stable in ML direction than the FP group. In the AP direction, the athletes from the EA group were more stable than the CS group. Nor personality, neither temperament did not differentiate the three groups of participants, beside agreeableness, which was significantly lower in both EA and FP groups. Openness to experiences is positively associated with COP parameters, as it was shown in regression analysis. All COP parameters can explain for about 40% of openness variability. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: The results of this study showed that EA and CS have better stability than footballers in both ML and AP direction. Openness seems to be related to postural balance skills."

Evidence supporting best practice guidelines for the management of ACL injury is to a large extent based on studies with low-level evidence. An international consensus group of experts was convened to collaboratively advance toward consensus opinions regarding the best available evidence on operative vs. non-operative treatment for ACL injury. The purpose of this study is to report the consensus statements on operative vs. non-operative treatment of ACL injuries developed at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019. Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organizing Committee and Session Chairs for the three working groups. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided the initial agreement and comments on the statement via an online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty percent agreement was defined a-priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative v. non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached the consensus during the Symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support, two reached strong consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports, early anatomic ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomic ACL reconstruction is indicated. The consensus statements derived from international leaders in the field will assist clinicians in deciding between operative and non-operative treatments with patients after an ACL injury.

Despite high rates of head injuries, many people in the U.S. and around the world continue to participate in collision sports. As one approach to address this concern, 2 nd Skull has developed supplemental protective headgears including a skull cap, scrum cap and headband that can be utilized in both helmet and non-helmet sports. To test the effectiveness of 2 nd Skull products as an adjunctive tool to reduce the severity of head impact, data were extracted from a series of tests completed at four sites under laboratory conditions using linear, projectile and rotational impactor to simulate blows to the head in sports. The majority of test cases showed the same pattern of reduced impact severity with the addition of 2 nd Skull padding. It remains to be seen if these laboratory results will translate to the field."

Data was collected through micro-scale behavioural mapping of public spaces (analysed using GIS) and both on-site and in-depth interviews. The integration of these methods allows a focus on intersectional identities and social values for everyday conviviality situated in different typologies of public open spaces (parks, squares, streets) in city centre and suburban neighbourhoods. The analysis offers nuanced insights into the socio-spatial aspects of conviviality: patterns of activity by diverse users, situations in which encounters are prompted, and the implications of negotiating differences in relation to perceptions of self, others, and the environment. We discuss the relevance of the urban public realm for shared understandings of diversity, qualities of visibility, lingering and playfulness, and the importance of threshold spaces. We explore racialised and excluding experiences and how these relate to mobility and territorial patterns of use, specifically with relation to gender. The paper highlights connections between intercultural encounters and urban design practice, with implications for well-being and integration in ethnically diverse urban areas."

Contemporary LTAD models suggest that a broad range of physical and psychosocial competencies should be developed in youth, but few resources are available for coaches that describe “how” to achieve these outcomes. This article overviews a coaching session framework built around the following components: raise, activate, mobilize, prepare, activity, games, evaluate (RAMPAGE). The framework provides practitioners with information on what can be planned and delivered and when within a coaching session, across multiple ages and stages of development within multiple contexts (e.g., physical education and talent development)."

Methods : Thirteen players completed 3 (sessions 1–3) or 4 (sessions 4–6) sets of 7 sprints (group 1 [n = 7]: 30-m straight; group 2 [n = 6]: 2 × 10-m shuttle), with 20 s and 4 min of recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. Postset perceptions of breathlessness (RPE-B) and leg-muscle exertion (RPE-L) were rated using the CR100 scale. Results : Overall, RPE-B (mean [SD]: 46 [13] arbitrary units [AU], “hard”) was most likely higher than RPE-L (39 [13] AU, “somewhat hard,” mean difference: 8 AU; 90% confidence limits [CLs]: ±2). Set-to-set increases in dRPE (in AU; 90% CL: approximately ±2) were large in session 1 (RPE-B: 15; RPE-L: 14), moderate in sessions 2–5 (RPE-B: 7–10; RPE-L: 7–8), and small (RPE-B: 6) to moderate (RPE-L: 7) in session 6. Across the intervention, RPE-B reduced moderately in sets 3 (−13; 90% CL: ±4) and 4 (−12; 90% CL: ±12) and RPE-L reduced by a small magnitude in set 3 (−5; 90% CL: ±6). The set 4 change in RPE-L was unclear (−11; 90% CL: ±13). Conclusions : The authors observed systematic intrasession and intersession changes in dRPE across a 2-wk repeated-sprint-training intervention, with a fixed prescription of external load that improved semiprofessional soccer players’ high-speed-running abilities. These findings could support dRPE as a measure of internal load and highlight its usefulness in evaluating repeated-sprint-training dose–response."

Regrettably, a scientific study on the skill has not been found in literature. Relying on talent of athletes to improvise on the fly can hardly be considered a viable learning strategy. This study targets to fill the gap by quantifying factors contributing to develop its coaching method. Using 3D motion capture (12-cameras, 200Hz) and full-body biomechanical modeling, our study aimed to identify elements that govern entrainment of the skill by examining jumping, kicking and falling phases of its execution. Given the rarity of players who have acquired this skill, we found five subjects for the study. Twenty-three trials were captured and quantified. The results unveil the following key elements: 1) the control of trunk rotation during the jumping, 2) the angle between thighs upon take-off, 3) the whip-like control of the kicking leg during airborne, 4) timing between ball motion and limbs&amp;rsquo; coordination, and 5) damping mechanism during falling. An accurate kick can only be achieved through repetitive training. This underlines the need for athletes to master a safe landing technique that minimizes risk of injury during practice. Therefore, training should begin with learning a safe falling technique."

https://openalex.org/W3020816688,Athlete availability and incidence of overuse injuries over an athletics season in a cohort of elite Swedish athletics athletes - a prospective study,2020-05-03,2020,article,"Athletics is a sport with a high incidence of injury, where most injuries are caused by overuse. Research on injury incidence and the occurrence of overuse injuries during a season in athletics is scarce. An athlete availability (unrestricted ability to participate in training or competition) of less than 80% has been linked with athletes being less likely to reach their performance goals. The purpose of this study was to estimate the monthly injury incidence rates, athlete availability, and the overuse injury incidence rate per 1000 athletics-hours of training in a cohort of Swedish elite athletics athletes.The cohort consisted of 59 male and female elite athletes competing in either middle or long-distance running, sprint, or jumping events. Injury and training data were collected during one athletics season, from October to the end of August. All injury data were collected by medical professionals. Training data were collected monthly, and consisted of event-specific training diaries covering training sessions, training days, and non-training or non-competition days. Monthly injury incidence rates were based on the number of new injuries per month in relation to the number of exposed (injury-free) athletes.The overall injury incidence rate for all athletes was highest in October (22.0%). Monthly injury incidence rate for middle and long-distance runners was highest in October (26.1%), for sprinters in April (19.0%), and for jumpers in October (21.4%). The overall athlete availability was 78.0% for the cohort. Sprinters had the lowest athlete availability (71.4%), followed by jumpers (77.3%), and middle-distance and long-distance runners (82.7%). Female athletes (76.5%) had a lower athlete availability than male athletes (79.7%). The injury incidence rate was 1.81 injuries per 1000 athletics hours of training. Middle and long-distance runners had the highest injury incidence rate (2.38), followed by jumpers (1.62), and sprinters (1.34).Monthly injury incidence rates during a season appears to correspond to periods of high training volume (conditioning phases and training camps). The low overall athlete availability (> 80%) indicates that many Swedish elite athletes are less likely to reach their full potential."

In the case of shapes of products, the Court of Justice of the European Union has aligned the interpretation of the relevant exclusionary provisions within design and trade mark laws. More recently, European jurisprudence within copyright law in relation to conditions of protection has imported the same considerations so as to regulate the protection of shapes of products. This article explores the multitude of doctrinal and policy reasons underpinning shape exclusions and argues that the Court is consciously creating an EU autonomous functionality doctrine within intellectual property law. We also argue that the Court is building a European macro-rationale within these laws namely to ensure that protection does not unduly restrict market freedom and competition."

In contrast, the effect of a single player's injury or one player's absence in team sports is much more difficult to quantify, both from the performance perspective and the financial perspective.In this study, we attempted to estimate the effect of injuries on the performance of football teams from the English Premier League (EPL), and the financial implications derived from this effect.Our analysis is based on data regarding game results, injuries and estimations of the players' financial value for the 2012-2013 through the 2016-2017 seasons.We found a statistically significant relationship (r=-0.46, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.28, p=0.001) between the number of days out due to injuries suffered by team members during a season and the place difference between their actual and expected finish in the EPL table (according to overall player value). Moreover, we can interpolate that approximately 136 days out due to injury causes a team the loss of one league point, and that approximately 271 days out due to injury costs a team one place in the table. This interpolation formula is used as a heuristic model, and given the relationship specified above accounts for a significant portion of the variance in league placement (21%), the remaining variance is related to other factors. Calculating the costs of wage bills and prize money, we estimate that an EPL team loses an average of £45 million sterling due to injury-related decrement in performance per season.Professional football clubs have a strong economic incentive to invest in injury prevention and rehabilitation programmes."

The primary outcome measured was occurrence of head injury and concussion.The databases include PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Medline and Sport Discus. The last search took place on 23 May 2019. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale evaluated the methodological quality of the selected studies with a funnel plot designed to determine publication bias. Study screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers.Initial screening generated 42 publications, with 12 meeting criteria for inclusion. Eight studies described concussion only. The rate ratio (RR) of head injury and concussion was less on artificial turf compared with natural grass (RR=0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04) as was the rate ratio of concussion only (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.89).Analysis of published data demonstrates a decreased incidence of head injury and concussion when contact sports are played on artificial turf. This difference was most marked for sports such as rugby and American football. However, artificial turf has no association with the incidence of head injury or concussion while playing soccer."

However, the alteration in neuromuscular activity of the lower-extremity during landing task is not clear. Objective : To compare the muscle activity pattern assessed by electromyography between the involved limb of patients with ACLR and the contralateral limb or control limb of matched healthy subjects during landing task. Evidence Acquisition : Database of PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science from the inception of the databases until July 2019, using a combination of keywords and their variations: (anterior cruciate ligament OR ACL) AND (electromyography OR EMG) AND (landing OR land). Studies that assessed lower-extremity muscle activity patterns during landing task in patients with ACLR and compared them either with the contralateral side or healthy controls were included. Evidence Synthesis : Of the 21 studies, 16 studies reported altered muscle activity pattern during landing tasks when compared with either the healthy controls or the contralateral side. For the specific muscle activity patterns, the majority of the studies showed no significant difference in reactive muscle activity, and comparisons across studies revealed a possible trend toward the early onset of quadriceps and hamstring activity and increased cocontraction of the involved limb. There are inconsistent findings regarding the alteration in muscle timing and preparatory muscle activity. Conclusions : Patients with ACLR displayed an altered muscle activity pattern during landing tasks, even though they were considered to be capable for sport return. Nevertheless, a firm conclusion could not be drawn due to great heterogeneity in the subject selection and study methods."

Concussion is generally poorly understood within the community. Many parents are unaware of the signs and varying symptoms of concussion. Despite the existence of concussion management and return to play guidelines, few parents are aware of how to manage their child's recovery and return to activities. Digital health technology can improve the way this information is communicated to the community.

Few studies describe complications of trauma after CDA, and to our knowledge this is the only study describing a grossly intact artificial cervical disk (ACD) without extrusion after high energy trauma. Based on our case and a review of literature, we hypothesize that, given adequate osseous integration (OI), CDA may be a safe intervention despite their risk for higher energy trauma.To present a rare case of high-energy trauma after CDA resulting in a Hangman's fracture and grossly in-tact ACD and to engage a biomechanical discussion of trauma after CDA and ACDF utilizing a literature review.Case-report with literature review and discussion.Electronic medical record data.Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and X-Ray physiologic measures.We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who received a C5-C6 level CDA with a (Synthes Prodisc-C©, Synthes Spine Company, L.P., West Chester, PA) and was subsequently involved in a high-speed motorcycle accident one-and-a-half years later resulting in a Hangman's fracture.Radiographic evidence after the motorcycle wreck demonstrated a minimally displaced Hangman's fracture at the C2 vertebrae through the pedicles on both sides, partially involving the transverse foramina with approximately 5 mm of displacement. The ACD at C5-C6 was grossly intact and no malalignment was noted. Three years later the patient elected to have an ACDF due to recurrence of facet pain that appeared by way of selective medial branch block injections to originate posteriorly in the facets of C5-6. A literature review revealed reports of trauma induced adjacent disk herniation, metallosis, and implant extrusion after CDA. No accounts of intact hardware, or concomitant Hangman's fracture after CDA were found following high-energy trauma.Our case reveals the first reported occurrence of a traumatic Hangman's fracture with intact fusion hardware after CDA. We hypothesize that the preserved mobility in the affected spinal level after the CDA exerted a protective effect compared to an ACDF following the high-speed trauma, particularly on the adjacent segments. This case and included literature review, reveal the need for future research efforts to guide decision making in whether ACDF or CDA is superior in younger patients at higher risk for trauma."

The 10 performance related parameters involved anthropometry (BMI), fitness test (agility, coordination, muscular endurance (push and sit up), power, YoYo level), and football skill test (dribbling with ball, dribbling without ball and juggling). All the parameters testing is carried out based on international standard and performed by well-trained staff. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to achieve the objective in this study. Result shows a positive correlation between the two types of muscular parameters; the power is influenced by BMI and coordination; the specific football tests are highly impacted by the power and agility. The coefficient of determination and the significance level -values show that the parameters that can be significantly considered are the anthropometric BMI (0.020), agility (0.025), muscular endurance (0.039 and 0.043), power (0.039), special football test without the ball (0.041), and juggling (0.046). The coordination, YoYo, football special test with the ball were not found to be significantly accounted for preparing the young players to achieve the required performance. Based on the results of the coefficient of determination and the significance -values of the parameters, a model was proposed to determine the highest and lowest parameters that play important roles in the selection of young players."

However, the validity of inertial-based motion analysis systems is specific to both the type of movement and the intensity at which movements are executed. Importantly, such a system should be relatively simple, so it can easily be used in daily practice. This paper introduces an easy-to-use inertial-based motion analysis system and evaluates its validity using an optoelectronic motion analysis system as a gold standard. The system was validated in 11 football players for six different football specific movements that were executed at low, medium, and maximal intensity. Across all movements and intensities, the root mean square differences (means ± SD) for knee and hip flexion/extension angles were 5.3° ± 3.4° and 8.0° ± 3.5°, respectively, illustrating good validity with the gold standard. In addition, mean absolute flexion/extension angular velocities significantly differed between the three movement intensities. These results show the potential to use the inertial based motion analysis system in football practice to obtain lower body kinematics and to quantify movement intensity, which both may improve currently used physical load estimates of the players."
https://openalex.org/W3018076652,Mitigating the Consequences of Subconcussive Head Injuries,2020-04-29,2020,review,"Subconcussive head injury represents a pathophysiology that spans the expertise of both clinical neurology and biomechanical engineering. From both viewpoints, the terms injury and damage, presented without qualifiers, are synonymously taken to mean a tissue alteration that may be recoverable. For clinicians, concussion is evolving from a purely clinical diagnosis to one that requires objective measurement, to be achieved by biomedical engineers. Subconcussive injury is defined as subclinical pathophysiology in which underlying cellular- or tissue-level damage (here, to the brain) is not severe enough to present readily observable symptoms. Our concern is not whether an individual has a (clinically diagnosed) concussion, but rather, how much accumulative damage an individual can tolerate before they will experience long-term deficit(s) in neurological health. This concern leads us to look for the history of damage-inducing events, while evaluating multiple approaches for avoiding injury through reduction or prevention of the associated mechanically induced damage."

RFID systems are able to identify and track devices, whilst WSNs cooperate to gather and provide information from interconnected sensors. This involves challenges, for example, in transforming RFID systems with identification capabilities into sensing and computational platforms, as well as considering them as architectures of wirelessly connected sensing tags. This, together with the latest advances in WSNs and with the integration of both technologies, has resulted in the opportunity to develop novel IoT applications. This paper presents a review of these two technologies and the obstacles and challenges that need to be overcome. Some of these challenges are the efficiency of the energy harvesting, communication interference, fault tolerance, higher capacities to handling data processing, cost feasibility, and an appropriate integration of these factors. Additionally, two emerging trends in IoT are reviewed: the combination of RFID and WSNs in order to exploit their advantages and complement their limitations, and wearable sensors, which enable new promising IoT applications."
https://openalex.org/W3023012647,The Biomechanics of Indirect Traumatic Optic Neuropathy Using a Computational Head Model With a Biofidelic Orbit,2020-04-28,2020,article,"Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is an injury to the optic nerve due to head trauma and usually results in partial or complete loss of vision. In order to advance a mechanistic understanding of the injury to the optic nerve, we developed a head model with a biofidelic orbit. Head impacts were simulated under controlled conditions of impactor velocity. The locations of impact were varied to include frontal, lateral, and posterior parts of the head. Impact studies were conducted using two types of impactors that differed in their rigidity relative to the skull. The simulated results from both the impactors suggest that forehead impacts are those to which the optic nerve is most vulnerable. The mode and location of optic nerve injury is significantly different between the impacting conditions. Simulated results using a relatively rigid impactor (metal cylinder) suggest optic nerve injury initiates at the location of the intracranial end of the optic canal and spreads to the regions of the optic nerve in the vicinity of the optic canal. In this case, the deformation of the skull at the optic canal, resulting in deformation of the optic nerve, was the primary mode of injury. On the other hand, simulated results using a relatively compliant impactor (soccer ball) suggest that primary mode of injury comes from the brain tugging upon the optic nerve (from where it is affixed to the intracranial end of the optic canal) during coup countercoup motion of the brain. This study represents the first published effort to employ a biofidelic simulation of the full length of the optic nerve in which the orbit is integrated within the whole head."
https://openalex.org/W3018694490,A neck compression injury criterion incorporating lateral eccentricity,2020-04-28,2020,article,"Abstract There is currently no established injury criterion for the spine in compression with lateral load components despite this load combination commonly contributing to spinal injuries in rollover vehicle crashes, falls and sports. This study aimed to determine an injury criterion and accompanying tolerance values for cervical spine segments in axial compression applied with varying coronal plane eccentricity. Thirty-three human cadaveric functional spinal units were subjected to axial compression at three magnitudes of lateral eccentricity of the applied force. Injury was identified by high-speed video and graded by spine surgeons. Linear regression was used to define neck injury tolerance values based on a criterion incorporating coronal plane loads accounting for specimen sex, age, size and bone density. Larger coronal plane eccentricity at injury was associated with smaller resultant coronal plane force. The level of coronal plane eccentricity at failure appears to distinguish between the types of injuries sustained, with hard tissue structure injuries more common at low levels of eccentricity and soft tissue structure injuries more common at high levels of eccentricity. There was no relationship between axial force and lateral bending moment at injury which has been previously proposed as an injury criterion. These results provide the foundation for designing and evaluating strategies and devices for preventing severe spinal injuries."

Some characterizations of Tarahumara running are also based on stereotypical views of athleticism among non-Western peoples, here labeled the ""fallacy of the athletic savage."" To place Tarahumara running more appropriately into its larger social and functional contexts, we combined our own observations and ethnographic evidence with interviews of 10 elderly Tarahumara runners about running during hunting as well as during footraces. We detail how running played an integral role in persistence hunting, in which groups of hunters employed a variety of methods to chase animals on foot. Running during hunting, moreover, is linked to men's and women's footraces, and both kinds of running are considered powerful forms of prayer. Long-distance running is also related to endurance dances that have important spiritual dimensions. Although the Tarahumara do not train to run in any traditional Western sense, and not all of them are great runners, the Tarahumara, like many Native American peoples, consider running, along with other endurance-based activities, to be important social and spiritual pursuits."

Normal postural balance is affected by various factors like age, gender, body characteristics like lean muscle mass, soft tissue mass, stature, foot anthropometry, etc. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1000 young population of north Karnataka in which human stature, weight, body mass index, foot anthropometric parameters, etc. along with postural sway were measured. The correlation of these parameters with human stature, weight and postural sway was studied. Data obtained were tabulated, graphically represented and statistically analyzed. Correlation coefficient was formulated for each variable. Foot length and width showed positive significant correlation with height, weight and other variables. Study observations were compared with those obtained from previous studies.

Artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, data mining, the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning have had a profound effect on the way we do things. These technologies have brought changes to the way we watch, play, compete, and also train sports. What was once simply training is now a combination of smart IoT sensors, cameras, algorithms, and systems just to achieve a new peak: The optimum one. This paper provides a systematic literature review of smart sport training, presenting 109 identified studies. Intelligent data analysis methods are presented, which are currently used in the field of Smart Sport Training (SST). Sport domains in which SST is already used are presented, and phases of training are identified, together with the maturity of SST methods. Finally, future directions of research are proposed in the emerging field of SST."

Methods A team of experienced players was divided randomly between three groups, undertaking a standard in-season regimen (C, n = 10), or supplementing this regimen by plyometric training on sand (PS, n = 11) or a stable surface (P, n = 10) for 7 weeks. Assessments included 20 m sprint times, change of direction tests (Modified change-of-direction T-test and Modified Illinois test), a repeated sprint T-test, jumping ability (squat, countermovement and five jump tests), and static and dynamic balance. Results After the intervention, PS showed significant increases of sprint speed relative to P and C. Change of direction scores were also improved for PS relative to P and C. Both PS and P increased vertical jump performance (squat jump, p = 0.005; ES = 0.170; counter-movement jump p &lt; 0.001; ES = 0.247). Repeated sprint T-test scores improved in PS and P relative to C, with best times of PS &gt; P ( p &lt; 0.05). Both plyometric groups improved their dynamic balance (p &lt; 0.05), with three parameters of PS and only one of P being significantly greater than C. Static balance was also enhanced in both experimental groups (PS &gt; P). Conclusions We conclude that for reasons that remain to be clarified, several performance measures in adolescent male handball players were increased more by 7 weeks of PS than by P."
https://openalex.org/W3020178995,Sport Practitioners as Sport Ecology Designers: How Ecological Dynamics Has Progressively Changed Perceptions of Skill “Acquisition” in the Sporting Habitat,2020-04-24,2020,article,"Over two decades ago, Davids et al. (1994) and Handford et al. (1997) raised theoretical concerns associated with traditional, reductionist, and mechanistic perspectives of movement coordination and skill acquisition for sport scientists interested in practical applications for training designs. These seminal papers advocated an emerging consciousness grounded in an ecological approach, signaling the need for sports practitioners to appreciate the constraints-led, deeply entangled, and non-linear reciprocity between the organism (performer), task, and environment subsystems. Over two decades later, the areas of skill acquisition, practice and training design, performance analysis and preparation, and talent development in sport science have never been so vibrant in terms of theoretical modeling, knowledge generation and innovation, and technological deployment. Viewed at an ecological level of analysis, the work of sports practitioners has progressively transitioned toward the facilitation of an evolving relationship between an organism (athlete and team) and its environment (sports competition). This commentary sets out to explore how these original ideas from Davids et al. (1994) and Handford et al. (1997) have been advanced through the theoretical lens of ecological dynamics. Concurrently, we provide case study exemplars, from applied practice in high-performance sports organizations, to illustrate how these contemporary perspectives are shaping the work of sports practitioners (sport ecology designers) in practice and in performance preparation."

The purpose of this study was to quantify college female and male lacrosse and soccer head impact biomechanics.Head impact biomechanics were collected from college lacrosse and soccer players across two Division 1 college athletic programs (96 female athletes, 141 male athletes; age, 19.8 ± 1.3 yr; height, 174.8 ± 9.2 cm; mass, 72.4 ± 11.7 kg). We deployed helmetless head impact measurement devices (X2 Biosystems xPatch) before each event. Peak linear and rotational accelerations were log-transformed for random intercepts general linear mixed models, and subsequently categorized based on impact magnitude for additional categorical analyses.Most linear (69.4%) and rotational (72.3%) head impact accelerations sustained by our study cohort were categorized as mild. On average, male athletes sustained impacts with higher linear accelerations than females (P = 0.04), and lacrosse athletes sustained higher linear acceleration impacts than soccer athletes (P = 0.023). Soccer athletes sustained significantly higher-magnitude impacts during competitions versus practices (linear, P < 0.001, rotational, P < 0.001), whereas lacrosse athletes sustained higher-magnitude impacts during practices versus competition (linear, P < 0.001; rotational, P < 0.001). Male athletes sustained higher accelerations in competitions versus practice (linear, P = 0.004; rotational, P < 0.001), whereas female athletes sustained higher accelerations in practice versus competitions (linear, P < 0.001; rotational, P = 0.02). There were no interactions between sex and sport on impact magnitude.Male athletes and lacrosse athletes experience higher-magnitude head impacts. Given the limited literature in this area, future research should continue characterizing head impact biomechanics in women's and nonhelmeted sports as well as validate nonhelmeted head impact technologies."

Methods The head impact biomechanics data set and video were collected from 22 high school football players, wearing HIT System instrumented helmets, competing in 218 special teams plays over a single high school football season. We used two separate video analysis approaches. To quantify the impact detection accuracy, we evaluated the video for head impacts independently of the impact data collection triggers collected by the HIT System. Video-observed impacts matched to valid and invalid head impacts by the HIT System algorithm were categorized as true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. To quantify impact location accuracy, we analyzed video-synchronized head impacts for impact location independent of the HIT System’s impact location measurement and quantified the estimated percent agreement of impact location between the HIT System recorded impact location and the impact location observed on video. Results The HIT System’s impact-filtering algorithm had 69% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 70% accuracy in categorizing true and non–head impact data collection triggers. The HIT System agreed with video-observed impact locations on 64% of the 129 impacts we analyzed (unweighted k = 0.43, 95% confidence interval = 0.31–0.54). Conclusion This work provides data on the HIT System’s impact detection and location accuracy during high school football special teams plays using game video analysis that has not been previously published. Based on our data, we believe that the HIT System is useful for estimating population-based impact location distributions for special teams plays."

It also explored the effect of diet, modeled using stable isotopes, on physiological stress levels and behavior. Materials and methods The sample comprised individuals from three archeological populations: Urban Late Roman‐ Early Byzantine (LREB) (300–700 AD), Medieval Urban Islamic (902–1,235 AD), and Medieval Rural Islamic. Bone lengths, femoral head dimensions, and cross‐sectional properties, diaphyseal products and circumferences, were compared to assess differences in body size and habitual loading in 222 adult individuals. Ordinary least squares regression evaluated the correlations between these measures and carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) stable isotope ratios in 115 individuals for whom both isotope values and osteological measures are available. Results The Medieval Rural Islamic group had shorter stature and reduced lower limb cross‐sectional properties compared to the two urban groups. Limb shape differs between Urban LREB and Urban Medieval Islamic groups. Measures of body size length were positively correlated with δ 13 C values in all individuals and separately in the Urban LREB and Rural Medieval Islamic groups. δ 15 N showed a positive correlation with left humerus shape in the Urban LREB sample. Conclusions The low stature and cross‐sectional properties of the Medieval Rural Islamic group may be an indicator of greater physiological stress, potentially due to poorer diet. Positive correlations between measures of body size and δ 13 C values further suggest that greater access to C 4 resources improved diet quality. Alternatively, this relationship could indicate greater body size among migrants from areas where individuals consumed more C 4 resources."

Hypothesis The prevalence of the accumulated changes increases with training experience. This is especially true for the dominant leg, which is involved in a large proportion of the athletes’ movements. Study Design Level 2 cross-sectional cohort study Methods MRI was used to assess the condition of 94 knee joints in 47 adult professional male soccer players (mean age 25.7 ± 4.6 years, BMI 22.8 ± 1.4). Previous surgery on joints was an exclusion criterion. No football player had knee injuries (including fresh bruises) for at least 3 months before the examination. All the scans were performed using a 1.5T MRI scanner and a slice thickness of 3 mm. The images were blindly analyzed by two experienced radiologists. We analyzed all the three compartments of the knee joint. We consider a chondral lesion already from grade I in modified Noyes and Stabler classification system. To assess the influence of soccer training experience, all players were divided into two groups: group 1 formed from players with less than 20 years of experience and group 2 with more than 20 years of experience. Results One hundred percent of the soccer players had at least one chondral and meniscal lesion. In both legs, the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (95.6%) was the most frequent site of injury. Most of the injuries were classified as grade II injuries (73.3% for the dominant and 75.6% for the non-dominant leg). Experience and age of the athletes significantly increased the probability of subcortical bone lesions. They were significantly positively correlated with the grades of patellar lesions and lesions of the patellar surface of the femur and significantly negatively correlated with the grades of lesions of posterior horn of lateral meniscus and anterior horn of medial meniscus. No statistically significant differences in the prevalence and grades of cartilage and meniscal lesions in the dominant and non-dominant limb were observed. Conclusion Soccer practice is associated with the increased prevalence of asymptomatic chondral and meniscal lesions. The probability of subcortical bone lesions significantly increases with training experience and age. These factors are also positively correlated with the grades of patellar lesions and lesions of the patellar surface of the femur. The prevalence and grade of asymptomatic chondral and meniscal lesions is independent of leg dominance."
https://openalex.org/W3016980072,Characterizing Human Box-Lifting Behavior Using Wearable Inertial Motion Sensors,2020-04-18,2020,article,"Although several studies have used wearable sensors to analyze human lifting, this has generally only been done in a limited manner. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigate multiple aspects of offline lift characterization using wearable inertial measurement sensors: detecting the start and end of the lift and classifying the vertical movement of the object, the posture used, the weight of the object, and the asymmetry involved. In addition, the lift duration, horizontal distance from the lifter to the object, the vertical displacement of the object, and the asymmetric angle are computed as lift parameters. Twenty-four healthy participants performed two repetitions of 30 different main lifts each while wearing a commercial inertial measurement system. The data from these trials were used to develop, train, and evaluate the lift characterization algorithms presented. The lift detection algorithm had a start time error of 0.10 s ± 0.21 s and an end time error of 0.36 s ± 0.27 s across all 1489 lift trials with no missed lifts. For posture, asymmetry, vertical movement, and weight, our classifiers achieved accuracies of 96.8%, 98.3%, 97.3%, and 64.2%, respectively, for automatically detected lifts. The vertical height and displacement estimates were, on average, within 25 cm of the reference values. The horizontal distances measured for some lifts were quite different than expected (up to 14.5 cm), but were very consistent. Estimated asymmetry angles were similarly precise. In the future, these proof-of-concept offline algorithms can be expanded and improved to work in real-time. This would enable their use in applications such as real-time health monitoring and feedback for assistive devices."
https://openalex.org/W3017013680,Risk factors for development of lower limb osteoarthritis in physically demanding occupations: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-04-17,2020,review,"This systematic review and meta-analysis identified and critically reviewed the findings of recent studies (last 15 years) examining relationships between specific physically demanding occupations or occupational tasks and development of lower limb osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty-eight studies with 266,227 cases of lower limb OA were included. Occupational tasks contributing to OA included farming, floor laying, and brick laying. Activities significantly contributing to the risk of knee OA were lifting heavy loads (>10 kg/week) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.29-1.79), squatting/kneeling (OR = 1.69, 95%CI 1.15-2.49), standing (>2 h/daily) (OR = 1.22 95%CI 1.02-1.46) and walking (OR = 1.40 95%CI 1.14-1.73). Lifting contributed significantly to the risk of hip OA (OR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.16-1.57). The effects of occupational exposures appear to be magnified by previous injury and BMI >25 kg/m2. Since specific occupational activities increase OA risk, ergonomist should encourage the use of existing tools, or oversee the design of new tools that may decrease exposure to such activities."

Peak and mean pressure were measured with the Biofoot-IBV in-shoe system from five repetitions of each task, with sensors positioned under the calcaneus, midfoot and phalanges on the lead and trail foot. Data were collected pre and immediately post-playing an official first national league competition match. The study was conducted with a sample of thirteen first league badminton players. A 2 × 2 repeated ANOVA found significant differences between the two tasks and between pre- and post-match (fatigued state). Players also had different foot pressure distributions for the LD and LND tasks, which indicated a difference in loading strategy. In a fatigued state, the plantar pressure shifted to the medial aspect of the midfoot in the trail limb, indicating a reduction in control and a higher injury risk during non-dominant lunge tasks."

The Fast-Fix device has undergone design changes to reduce deployment failure since its introduction in 2001. Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and mechanism of intra-operative deployment failure of the 3 rd generation Fast-fix 360™ (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, USA) device. Method Data was prospectively collected for 106 consecutive all-inside meniscal repairs undertaken with the Fast-fix 360™ device. Patient demographics, mechanism of failure, site and type of repair were recorded. Results 20 deployment failures occurred in 423 Fast-fix 360™ deployments, an incidence of 4.72%. Deployment failure occurred in 19 of 109 patients an incidence of 17.43%. Six different failure mechanisms occurred; anchor exiting device without trigger being initiated, anchors not holding in meniscus, both anchors simultaneously exiting device and braided suture failing. The most common failure mechanism was failure of the second anchor not holding in the meniscus. Average cost of device failure was $75 per patient. Conclusion Despite design modification, deployment failure still occurs with similar modes top to the original design."

The majority of the studies have multiple perspectives (epidemiology, biomechanics, performance), however only a few studies were able to identify risk factors or mechanisms that contribute to tennis injuries. Until now, there has not been a systematic literature review that identifies risk factors for tennis injuries. The objective of this review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence related to risk factors for upper limb injury in tennis players. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, using a research question developed by the Patient Problem, (or Population) Intervention, Comparison or Control, and Outcome (PICO) methodology. The quality of the studies included was moderate to low, indicating prolonged tennis (exposure to tennis), scapular dyskinesis, muscle fatigue, scapulothoracic properties, shoulder kinetics or kinematics, skill level, and technique as risk factors for upper limb injury in tennis players. In this review, it is evidenced that the majority of tennis injuries are associated with overuse and a chronic time course, however, tennis injuries do not arise from a linear combination of isolated and predictive factors. Therefore, the multifactorial and complex nature of tennis injuries has to be further examined. The necessity of more randomized control trial studies is highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3017168997,Predicting Concussion Outcome by Integrating Finite Element Modeling and Network Analysis,2020-04-15,2020,article,"Concussion is a significant public health problem affecting 1.6-2.4 million Americans annually. An alternative to reducing the burden of concussion is to reduce its incidence with improved protective equipment and injury mitigation systems. Finite element (FE) models of the brain response to blunt trauma are often used to estimate injury potential and can lead to improved helmet designs. However, these models have yet to incorporate how the patterns of brain connectivity disruption after impact affects the relay of information in the injured brain. Furthermore, FE brain models typically do not consider the differences in individual brain structural connectivities and their purported role in concussion risk. Here, we use graph theory techniques to integrate brain deformations predicted from FE modeling with measurements of network efficiency to identify brain regions whose connectivity characteristics may influence concussion risk. We computed maximum principal strain in 129 brain regions using head kinematics measured from 53 professional football impact reconstructions that included concussive and non-concussive cases. In parallel, using diffusion spectrum imaging data from 30 healthy subjects, we simulated structural lesioning of each of the same 129 brain regions. We simulated lesioning by removing each region one at a time along with all its connections. In turn, we computed the resultant change in global efficiency to identify regions important for network communication. We found that brain regions that deformed the most during an impact did not overlap with regions most important for network communication (Pearson's correlation, ρ = 0.07; p = 0.45). Despite this dissimilarity, we found that predicting concussion incidence was equally accurate when considering either areas of high strain or of high importance to global efficiency. Interestingly, accuracy for concussion prediction varied considerably across the 30 healthy connectomes. These results suggest that individual network structure is an important confounding variable in concussion prediction and that further investigation of its role may improve concussion prediction and lead to the development of more effective protective equipment."

And, dual small plate fixation has been reported as can minimize hardware-related complications. However, the biomechanical properties of the dual small plate fixation have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we report the results of a finite element analysis of the biomechanical properties of midshaft clavicle fractures treated with dual small plating and superior and anteroinferior single plate fixation. Methods A three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of the midshaft clavicle fractures was created, whose 4-mm transverse fracture gap, having an angle &lt; 30 degree and devoid of overlapping triangles, was simulated between the fractured segments of the middle-shaft of the clavicle. The equivalent von Mises stress and displacement of the model was used as the output measures for analysis. Results No significant differences were found between dual plating, superior or anteroinferior single plating in cantilever bending, axial compression, and axial torsion. Dual plating with a smaller plate-screw construct is biomechanically eligible to compare with superior and anteroinferior single plate fixation using larger plate-screw constructs. Conclusions This study demonstrated that larger plate-screw constructs for the treatment of simple are placed clavicular fractures; however, weight-bearing and exorbitant shoulder activity should be avoided after the operation. Therefore, dual plating may provide a viable option for fixing midshaft clavicle fractures and, thus, may be preferred for patients who need early activity."

Objectives: The present study aimed to compare the peak pressure, maximum force, contact area, and contact time between the right and left foot and their correlations with height and weight in elite weightlifters. Methods: This study was conducted on 12 elite weightlifters with the mean age of 23.2 ± 2.26 years. The parameters of plantar pressure distribution were measured using the Emed platform during barefoot walking. In addition, the AutoMask software was used to divide the sole into 10 anatomical regions. The parameters of peak pressure, maximum force, contact area, and contact time in each region were also estimated using the MultiMask evaluation software. Data analysis was performed using paired t-test and Pearson's correlation-coefficient (P ≤ 0.05). Results: Significant differences were observed in the peak pressure parameter in the third region (medial midfoot) and maximum force parameter in the ninth region (9th toe) between the right and left foot. Moreover, positive, significant correlations were denoted between height and weight with the peak pressure, maximum force, contact area, and contact time (P < 0.01). In the left foot, an inverse, significant correlation was observed between the maximum force and height in the fifth region (first metatarsal bone) (P < 0.05). Conclusions: According to the results, the functional demand for both feet is very close in weightlifting. Therefore, insole designers must pay special attention to the reduction of the load on the third to fifth metatarsal bones in order to prevent complications such as metatarsalgia in athletes in the long run."

To better protect the head against various crash, sport, or fall events, the underlying mechanisms and tolerances need to be investigated. Many investigations have been conducted using cadaver heads, animal heads, physical head models, and in vitro models throughout the world. These experiments, together with the development of computational techniques, have subsequently led to the development of numerical head models, especially finite element (FE) models, to allow more in-depth biomechanical studies. A large number of FE head models have been developed during the years and authors are trying to find the best solutions for a correct explanation of the lesional mechanisms. The finite element method (FEM) is based on the energy formulation of the mechanics of the structures and on approximation methods. It consists of approximating the actual structure through a model consisting of finite elements interconnected in points called nodes. By nodes, each item is under compatibility and balance conditions with adjacent elements. The present paper is a literature review, underlying some of the finite element models, which allowed a good explanation of the head trauma mechanisms."

The purpose of this review was to compile the most recent literature regarding biomechanical adaptations to load carriage, including its effects on musculoskeletal injury, kinematic, spatiotemporal, and kinetic adaptations, and insights about the future of load carriage research. Researchers found a high degree of injury in personnel who participate in heavy load carriage activities as a part of their job, with lower back and lower extremity injuries being the most common. An observation of several studies that measured kinematic, spatiotemporal, and kinetic adaptations suggest that there may be a threshold in which typical gait kinematics must change to account for the additional load. Not adapting proper mechanisms to deal with increased load carriage forces may lead to lower extremity injury. Future studies should observe how persons untrained in load carriage respond to these loads, and how controlling for variables like speed and cadence affect gait adaptations."

Little is known of these factors in professional Australian football. Video analysis allows HAE verification and characterization of important determinants of injury.To characterize verified HAEs in the nonhelmeted contact sport of professional Australian football and investigate the association of sex, player position, and player experience with HAE frequency and magnitude.Descriptive epidemiology study.Professional Australian football players wore a nonhelmeted accelerometer for 1 match, with data collected across 14 matches. HAEs with peak linear accelerations (PLAs) ≥30g were verified with match video. Verified HAEs were summarized by frequency and median PLA and compared between the sexes, player position, and player experience. Characterization of match-related situations of verified HAEs was conducted, and the head impact rate per skill execution was calculated.92 male and 118 female players were recruited during the 2017 season. Male players sustained more HAEs (median, 1; IQR, 0-2) than female players (median, 0; IQR, 0-1; P = .007) during a match. The maximum PLAs incurred during a match were significantly higher in male players (median, 61.8g; IQR, 40.5-87.1) compared with female players (median, 44.5g; IQR, 33.6-74.8; P = .032). Neither player position nor experience was associated with HAE frequency. Of all verified HAEs, 52% (n = 110) occurred when neither team had possession of the football, and 46% (n = 98) were caused by contact from another player attempting to gain possession of the football. A subset of HAEs (n = 12; 5.7%) resulted in players seeking medical aid and/or being removed from the match (median PLA, 58.8g; IQR, 34.0-89.0), with 2 (male) players diagnosed with concussion after direct head impacts and associated PLAs of 62g and 75g, respectively. In the setting of catching (marking) the football, female players exhibited twice the head impact rate (16 per 100 marking contests) than male players (8 per 100 marking contests).Playing situations in which players have limited control of the football are a common cause of impacts. Male players sustained a greater exposure to HAEs compared with female players. Female players, however, sustained higher exposure to HAEs than male players during certain skill executions, possibly reflecting differences in skill development. These findings can therefore inform match and skill development in the emerging professional women's competition of Australian football."

Despite the introduction of pre-participation cardiovascular screening, especially among young competitive athletes, sport-related SCD remains a debated issue among medical personnel, sports communities and laypersons alike, and generates significant media attention. The most frequent cause of SCD is a hidden inherited cardiomyopathy, the athletes may not even be aware of. Predictive medicine, by searching the presence of pathogenic alterations in cardiac genes, may be an integrative tool, besides the conventional ones used in cardiology (mainly electro and echocardiogram), to reach a definitive diagnosis in athletes showing signs/symptoms, even borderline, of inherited cardiomyopathy/ channelopathy, and in athletes presenting family history of SCD and/or of hereditary cardiac disease. In this review, we revised the molecular basis of the major cardiac diseases associated to sudden cardiac death and the clinical molecular biology approach that can be used to perform risk assessment at DNA level of sudden cardiac death, contributing to the early implementation of adequate therapy. Alterations can occur in ion channel genes, in genes encoding desmosomal and junctional proteins, sarcomeric and Z-disc proteins, proteins for the cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided the means to search for mutations in all these genes, at the same time. Therefore, this molecular approach should be the preferred methodology for the aforementioned purpose."

In many of them, using head protective equipment is not mandatory, even if the use of headbands could increase the level of safety regarding several types of traumatic brain injuries. Many commercial solutions are currently available, based on plastic-based foams providing a decent level of protection and comfort to the user. This work introduces the use of agglomerated cork as an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic foams but at least keeping safety levels. Cork is a natural cellular material that has been showing excellent crashworthiness properties. In this study, cork agglomerate density is carefully chosen to be incorporated into a protective headband. Results are compared against three other commercial headbands. For each one, the risk of brain injury was analysed for different injury thresholds and impact energies. The results clearly demonstrate that the cork-based apparel may provide comparable, and in some cases, better performances, outlasting the commercial ones."

Evidence of a robust inverse relationship between the frequency and magnitude of repeated head impacts and disturbed brain network function is needed to strengthen an argument for causality. In pursuing such a relationship, we used cap-worn inertial sensors to measure the frequency and magnitude of head impacts sustained by eighteen intercollegiate water polo athletes monitored over a single season of play. Participants were evaluated before and after the season using computerized cognitive tests of inhibitory control and resting electroencephalography. Greater head impact exposure was associated with increased phase synchrony [r(16) > 0.626, p < 0.03 corrected], global efficiency [r(16) > 0.601, p < 0.04 corrected], and mean clustering coefficient [r(16) > 0.625, p < 0.03 corrected] in the functional networks formed by slow-wave (delta, theta) oscillations. Head impact exposure was not associated with changes in performance on the inhibitory control tasks. However, those with the greatest impact exposure showed an association between changes in resting-state connectivity and a dissociation between performance on the tasks after the season [r(16) = 0.481, p = 0.043] that could also be attributed to increased slow-wave synchrony [F(4, 135) = 113.546, p < 0.001]. Collectively, our results suggest that athletes sustaining the greatest head impact exposure exhibited changes in whole-brain functional connectivity that were associated with altered information processing and inhibitory control."

You’re asking the wrong question,2020-04-01,2020,review,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have been a rising concern in the early years of the women’s Australian Football League (AFLW), eliciting headlines of a ‘knee crisis’ surrounding the league. There has been a focus on female biology as the primary factor driving the high rate of ACL injuries in the AFLW. Emphasising Australian football (AF) as being dangerous predominantly due to female biology may be misrepresenting a root cause of the ACL injury problem, perpetuating gender stereotypes that can restrict physical development and participation of women and girls in the sport. We propose that an approach addressing environmental and sociocultural factors, along with biological determinants, is required to truly challenge the ACL injury problem in the AFLW. Sports science and medicine must therefore strive to understand the whole system of women in AF, and question how to address inequities for the benefit of the athletes."

Proponents of the evolutionary approach to understanding running injury suggest that humans ran using less injurious biomechanics prior to the invention of cushioned running shoes. Those who disagree with this view, point to the many runners, wearing cushioned running shoes, who do not get injured and suggest that the evolutionary approach is indulging in a ‘natural fallacy’. This polarises the scientific debate into discrete categories such as ‘shod’ vs ‘barefoot’. This review aims, first, to describe humans’ innate impact moderating mechanisms which arise from our evolutionary legacy. Second, we discuss the impact of footwear on these mechanisms and the potential link to injury in some runners. Finally, we discuss the role of barefoot training in sports medicine and attempt to make some practical suggestions as to how it might be integrated in our modern urban environments."

Interventions to reduce injury have included resistance, balance, and jump training elements. The use of sand-based jump training has been postulated as an effective treatment. However, evidence on landing mechanics is limited.To determine potential differences in landing strategies and subsequent landing knee valgus when performing single-leg landing (SLL) and drop jump (DJ) tasks onto sand and land, and to compare between both male and female populations.A randomized repeated-measures crossover design.University laboratory.Thirty-one participants (20 males and 11 females) from a university population.All participants completed DJ and SLL tasks on both sand and land surfaces.Two-dimensional frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) of knee valgus was measured in both the DJ and SLL tasks (right and left) for both sand and land conditions.FPPA was lower (moderate to large effect) for SLL in sand compared with land in both legs (left: 4.3° [2.8°]; right: 4.1° [3.8°]) for females. However, effects were unclear (left: -0.7° [2.2°]) and trivial for males (right: -1.1° [1.9°]). FPPA differences for males and females performing DJ were unclear; thus, more data is required. Differences in FPPA (land vs sand) with respect to grouping (sex) for both SLL left (4.9° [3.0°]) and right (5.1° [4.0°]) were very likely higher (small)/possibly moderate for females compared with males.The effects of sand on FPPA during DJ tasks in males and females are unclear, and further data is required. However, the moderate to large reductions in FPPA in females during SLL tasks suggest that sand may provide a safer alternative to firm ground for female athletes in anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention and rehabilitation programs, which involve a SLL component."

https://openalex.org/W3021025124,PROSPECTIVE MEASURES OF INTRA-REGION BRAIN REGULARITY DIFFERENTIATES ACL INJURED AND UNINJURED ATHLETES,2020-04-01,2020,article,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are debilitating for athletes. While numerous motor and biomechanical deficits contribute to the inciting ACL injury mechanism, the limited knowledge about the underlying neural drivers of these deficits has impeded intervention development to reduce ACL injury rates. A prospective investigation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in female soccer players revealed decreased connectivity between the primary somatosensory cortex and cerebellum for athletes that went on to ACL injury athletes compared to their healthy teammates. Although information about inter-region connectivity patterns is informative, this finding does elucidate the individual, intra-region brain activity that may be further underlie ACL injury mechanisms. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the intra-region regularity of the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal activity in 25 knee-related regions of interests (ROI) between athletes who sustained an ACL injury and matched controls. Methods: Adolescent female soccer athletes were evaluated using fMRI to capture resting-state brain connectivity prior to their competitive season. Two of these athletes (16.0±0yrs, 169.0±2.8cm, 60.1±8.3kg) later experienced an ACL injury and were matched to eight uninjured teammates (15.9±0.8yrs, 164.0±4.9cm, 58.3±7.6kg). Standard fMRI data processing was used to determine resting-state BOLD signal activity in 25 knee-related ROIs. Sample entropy (SampEn) was then used to quantify the regularity of each individual ROI. A lower SampEn value indicates a ROI’s BOLD signal activity was more regular (predictable) and a higher value indicates a signal’s activity was more irregular (unpredictable). T-tests—with a Bonferroni correction for the familywise error rate ( p &lt; .002)—were used to compare SampEn values between both groups for all 25 ROIs. Results: ACL injured athletes ( M = 0.35±0.01) exhibited higher SampEn values in the left primary motor cortex than matched, uninjured athletes ( M = 0.29±0.02; t(8)=4.62, p=.0017, d=3.65). Conclusion: Athletes who sustained an ACL injury exhibited less regularity in BOLD signal activity of the left primary motor cortex. As the primary motor cortex serves as the final destination in the brain before efferent information is sent to the spinal cord to initiate movement, decreased BOLD signal regularity in this region may alter such cortical-spinal transmission. Considering ACL injuries often occur during unpredictable environments, irregular activity of motor cortex activity may dampen an athlete’s ability to sustain a safe knee position. These findings may help to guide development of brain-driven biofeedback training to promote adaptive neuroplasticity that ‘pushes’ the motor cortex towards more regular activity. [Figure: see text]"
https://openalex.org/W3021145221,EFFECTS OF NEUROMUSCULAR TRAINING ON BIOMECHANICAL EFFICIENCY IN HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES,2020-04-01,2020,article,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common and devastating sports-related knee injuries. Neuromuscular training (NMT) has demonstrated efficacy as a preventive intervention for ACL injury and has been associated with improvements in measures of sports performance, but the specific physiologic mechanisms that serve as protective factors and contribute to improved performance haven not been well-defined. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between NMT and biomechanical efficiency among high school athletes. We hypothesized that the performance of NMT is associated with improved biomechanical efficiency during the performance of fundamental movements and agility tests when compared to a group of untrained control subjects. Methods: Eight high school soccer and basketball teams (111 athletes, 53.1% male, mean age 15.6 years) were recruited and assigned to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group performed NMT as part of their warm-up prior to each practice and competition for 12 weeks. NMT was administered by experienced sports medicine clinicians who provided exercise instruction, technique cues, and performance feedback throughout each training session. The control group performed their customary warm-up under the direction of the team’s coaches. Biomechanical efficiency was assessed through performance of static and dynamic tests using an FDA-approved wireless sensor system. Agility was assessed using a timed three-cone agility test. All tests were administered immediately prior to and following each competitive sports season. Results: Matched pre-/post-season data was collected from 74 athletes (67%). Significant improvements [point estimate (95% CI) p-value] were observed in the intervention group for left lower extremity [0.25 (0.06,0.45) p = 0.01] and right lower extremity [0.21 (0.05,0.37) p = 0.01] loading/landing speed ratios during a single leg hop test, left lower extremity [-136.34 (-225.74,-46.95) p = 0.003] and right lower extremity [-110 (-211.36,-8.64) p = 0.03] ground reaction force, left lower extremity [-1.03, (-.189,-0.18) p = 0.02] and right lower extremity [-0.94 (-1.73,-0.14) p = 0.02] initial peak acceleration, and cadence [-12.12 (-21.60,-2.65) p = 0.01] during a straight-line running acceleration/deceleration test, and time [0.51 (0.24,0.78) p = 0.0003] during a three-cone agility test. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that season-long, sport-specific, age-appropriate NMT administered by sports medicine clinicians can significantly improve biomechanical efficiency during the performance of fundamental movements and agility tests by high school athletes. To achieve similar results, sports coaches should be trained to provide exercise instruction, technique cues, and performance feedback when administering NMT in real-world settings.

The purpose of the study is to determine the potential clinical utility and application of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), Y Balance Test (YBT), Tuck Jump Assessment (TJA), and Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) in a sample of post-concussion soccer athletes and a sample of healthy age and gender matched soccer athlete controls to identify differences. Differentiation was defined as significance in raw score performance on the FMS, YBT, TJA, LESS. Prospective data was collected on lower extremity injury within 6-months post-concussion. Methods: The study participants were administered the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS in successive order by a licensed athletic trainer. All measures were administered in a biomechanical lab setting. Post-concussion soccer athletes were administered the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS after receiving formal medical clearance from a licensed physician. Post-concussion soccer athletes were matched with healthy soccer athlete controls by age, gender, and years of participation. All study participants were administered screening measures at rest. All demographic and raw data were summarized using descriptive statistics with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals calculated for all end points. Independent sample t-tests were performed at &lt;0.05 to measure significant differences between groups. Results: 50 (17 female, 33 male; mean age=14.1; mean years of participation=6.8) post-concussion soccer athletes and 50 (17 female, 33 male; mean age=14.3; mean years of participation=6.7) matched soccer athlete controls were administered the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS. Significant differences were observed between the post-concussion and control groups on FMS Deep Squat ( t=-9.76, p=&lt;0.001), Inline Lung ( t=-8.43, p=&lt;0.001), and LESS total score (t=-9.21, p=&lt;0.001). No other significant differences were observed. Conclusions: The current study identified the FMS, YBT, TJA, and LESS as potential movement screening tests in which differences could be observed in a sample of post-concussion and healthy control soccer athletes. Results from the current study identified specific differences between groups with respect to movement screening test performance on the FMS Deep Squat, Inline Lunge, and LESS total score. Further research is warranted to clearly define the observed differences. Clinicians should consider these findings when providing recommendations and discussing recovery in concussion patients."

Moreover, anatomical and biomechanical factors may predispose female athletes to higher risk compared to males. At present, there is no effective injury prevention strategy to protect female athletes from sports-related head impact. Hypothesis/Purpose: (1). We aimed to use resting-state fMRI to investigate the effect of a full season of competitive soccer on brain functional network integrity in female high school athletes. (2). We also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a jugular vein compression neck collar device, designed to mitigate potential injury by reducing the brain slosh effect. Methods: A total of 125 high school female soccer athletes were included in this study. These athletes were assigned randomly to a non-collar (n=55, age=16.06±1.06 yrs) or collar group (n=70, 15.81±0.95 yrs) before the season started. High resolution 3D T1-weighted images and resting-state fMRI data were collected prospectively at pre-season and again at post-season. Data processing and analysis were conducted in the MATLAB-based programs Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) and Connectivity Toolbox (Conn). Functional connectivity was computed between each pair of 105 anatomically delineated regions of interest (ROI). Network Based Statistics were applied to detect coherent patterns of altered connectivity from pre- to post-season. Results: The non-collar group showed a significant pattern of altered connectivity (p-FWE = 0.047) spanning 60% of ROIs (63/105) and 1.7% of ROI-ROI connections (94/5,460). 65 of the 94 altered connections were weakened from pre-to-post season and tended to occur in the right hemisphere. 29 of the 94 altered connections were strengthened from pre-to-post season and tended to involve regions in the occipital lobe. The collar group did not show any statistically significant change (p-FWE = 0.223). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that exposure to repetitive sub-concussive head impacts during a single season of competitive female soccer induces changes in brain functional connectivity. The observed increases and decreases of functional connectivity strength comprising the pattern of altered connectivity are congruent with a heterogeneous response to insult wherein some connections are reduced in strength due to neuronal damage and other “detour” connections are strengthened to preserve network function. Comparatively, the absence of alterations in the collar group suggest that the jugular vein compression collar may have generated a potentially protective effect to preserve brain functional network integrity during exposure to head impacts.

Global positioning system data (Catapult Minimax S4) were collected at 10 Hz of 129 competitive player games from the Tyrrells Premier15 league. Players were classified according to broad (Forwards, Backs) and specific positions (front-, second-, back-row, scrum-half, inside-, and outside-backs). Total distances, maximum speed, and player loads were calculated. Mean total distance was 4982 m and was similar between the Forwards and Backs, with second-row players covering the most (5297 m) and outside-backs the least (4701 m). Inside- and outside-backs covered a significantly greater distance at high speed running (134 m; 178 m) and sprinting (74 m; 92 m) speeds, respectively, whereas the second- and back-row covered greater distances jogging (1966 m; 1976 m) and the front-row spent the greatest overall distance walking (2613 m). Outside-backs reached greater maximum speed than all other positions (24.9 km.h-1). The mean player load was highest in the back-row (562 AU) and second-row (555 AU) and these were higher than the outside-backs (476 AU). These findings indicate that the demands placed on female rugby players are position specific and differ from male players. Additionally, the data are the first obtained from the 10 Hz GPS and from within English domestic women's rugby, thus adding to the overall limited data available on women's rugby union."
https://openalex.org/W3014267970,Associations between biomechanical and clinical/anthropometrical factors and running-related injuries among recreational runners: a 52-week prospective cohort study,2020-03-31,2020,article,"Background: The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate whether runners with certain biomechanical or clinical/anthropometrical characteristics sustain more running-related injuries than runners with other biomechanical or clinical/anthropometrical characteristics. Methods: The study was designed as a prospective cohort with 52-weeks follow-up. A total of 224 injury-free, recreational runners were recruited from the Gothenburg Half Marathon and tested at baseline. The primary exposure variables were biomechanical and clinical/anthropometrical measures, including strength, lower extremity kinematics, joint range of motion, muscle flexibility, and trigger points. The primary outcome measure was any running-related injury diagnosed by a medical practitioner. Cumulative risk difference was used as measure of association. A shared frailty approach was used with legs as the unit of interest. A total of 448 legs were included in the analyses. Results: The cumulative injury incidence proportion for legs was 29.0% (95%CI = 24.0%; 34.8%). A few biomechanical and clinical/anthropometrical factors influence the number of running-related injuries sustained in recreational runners. Runners with a late timing of maximal eversion sustained 20.7% (95%CI = 1.3; 40.0) more injuries, and runners with weak abductors in relation to adductors sustained 17.3% (95%CI = 0.8; 33.7) more injuries, compared with the corresponding reference group. Conclusions: More injuries are likely to occur in runners with late timing of maximal eversion or weak hip abductors in relation to hip adductors."
https://openalex.org/W3014770179,The Effects of Cold Water Immersion on the Recovery of Drop Jump Performance and Mechanics: A Pilot Study in Under-20 Soccer Players,2020-03-31,2020,article,"Cold water immersion (CWI) is a popular method used for enhancing recovery from exercise. However, the efficacy of this approach is inconclusive and studies investigating variables contributing to overall performance are scarce. Additionally, few studies have investigated the recovery of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) performance after a fatiguing SSC task. The SSC occurs naturally in human locomotion and induces a recovery pattern different from isolated muscle contractions (e.g., pure eccentric exercise). Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single CWI on jumping performance and mechanics after exhaustive SSC exercise. On a sledge apparatus, ten male under-20 soccer players (age 18-20 years) performed five sets of 20 maximal drop jumps (DJ) followed by continuous submaximal rebounding. Subjects were equally randomized into a passive recovery control (CON) or CWI group (10±0.5°C for 20 minutes). Prior to, upon completion of, and at 24 (24H) and 48-hour (48H) follow-ups, subjects performed maximal DJs recorded with a high-speed video camera. Blood samples were taken and subjective muscle soreness was measured. Rebound jump height was impaired immediately after exercise, although significant only for CWI (CON: -12.4 cm, p = 0.083; CWI: -9.9 cm, p = 0.009). The CWI group demonstrated significant recovery of jump height at 24H (+6.3 cm, p = 0.031) and 48H (+8.9 cm, p = 0.002) compared to post-exercise. Ankle joint stiffness was decreased for CWI (-2.1 to -2.5 Nm/deg, p = 0.005-0.041). Creatine kinase activity was similarly increased for both groups at 24H and 48H, while there was also no group effect in muscle soreness (p ≥ 0.056). This pilot study demonstrates the potential for CWI to slightly enhance the recovery of DJ performance. However, this occurred in parallel with reduced ankle joint stiffness, signifying that jumps were performed with less efficiency, which would not be favourable for repeated SSC actions. While this should be confirmed with a larger sample size, this highlights the potential for CWI to be detrimental to the mechanical properties of the ankle joint. Therefore, future recovery intervention studies should concomitantly investigate variables contributing to performance, rather than just overall performance itself."

A group of 13 players (age 20.2 ± 3.3 years, body mass 57.2 ± 3.7 kg, height 163.6 ± 5.3 cm, VO2max 45.2 ± ml/min) underwent either a complex (the intermittent load type) or combined (the maximal strength and dynamic method) model of training. The training load was tailored to each athlete. Results showed that the complex model of training improved power (10 W/kg, p = 0.006) and height of vertical jump (5.3 cm, p = 0.001), weight of 1 Repeat Maximum (1RM) which was (5.8 kg, p = 0.015), power and speed in the acceleration phase of barbell half squats (BHS) at weights from 20 to 60 kg, and the number of repetitions in BHS (10.3%, p = 0.012). The combined model of training improved the time of shuttle run (0.44 s, p = 0.000), weight of 1RM in BHS (9.6kg, p = 0.000) and BP (4 kg, p = 0.000), power in the acceleration phase of BHS at weights from 50 to 60 kg, the number of repetitions in BP (14.3%, p = 0.000), BHS (9.4%, p = 0.002), barbell bench pulls (11.9%, p = 0.002) and sit-ups (7.7%, p = 0.001). These findings indicate that the complex model of training improves explosive abilities, whereas the combined model is effective for developing strength at weights close to players' 1RM and for repeatedly overcoming resistance. Therefore, coaches should choose the training model based on the needs of individual players."

Methods: This study included 27 participants with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis. Cross-sectional area of hip muscles, including psoas major, rectus femoris, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and minimus, adductor longus and magnus, obturator internus, and obturator externus, were measured from magnetic resonance images. Hip pain and function were evaluated using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) categorised into 5 subscales: pain, symptoms, activity of daily living, sport and recreation function, and hip-related quality of life (for each subscale 0 representing extreme problems and 100 representing no problems). Results: Mean age of the 27 participants was 63.2 (SD 7.6) years and 66.7% (n=18) were female. After adjusting for age and gender, greater cross-sectional area of adductor longus and magnus was associated with a higher HOOS score in quality of life (regression coefficient 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-2.7, p=0.02), activity of daily living (regression coefficient 1.3, 95% CI 0.1-2.6, p=0.04) and sport and recreation function (regression coefficient 1.6, 95% CI 0.1-3.0, p=0.04). There was a trend towards an association between greater cross-sectional area of psoas major and a higher quality of life score (regression coefficient 3.6, 95% CI -0.5 to 7.7, p=0.08). The cross-sectional area of hip muscles was not significantly associated with HOOS pain or symptom score. Conclusion: Greater cross-sectional area of hip adductors was associated with better function and quality of life in individuals with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis. Greater cross-sectional area of hip flexors might be associated with better quality of life. These findings, while need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies, suggest that targeting the hip adductor and flexor muscles may improve function and quality of life in those with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis."

Selective reconstruction may be considered as an option in isolated bundle rupture. The purpose of this study is to evaluate both subjective and objective clinical results, as well as functional recovery time, after selective arthroscopic single-bundle reconstruction in a consecutive series of patients affected by partial ACL rupture.Thirty-six patients undergoing selective reconstruction of a single ACL bundle were retrospectively evaluated from a series of 354 ACL reconstructions performed over a 3-year period. Although the suspicion of partial lesions was present at clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation, final diagnosis was obtained during arthroscopy. All patients were operated using the same technique and type of fixation, and undergoing the same functional recovery protocol.Mean follow-up was 64 months (48-84 months). All patients but one achieved good functional recovery and returned to their sports within a mean period of 6.1 months. A single patient complained of postoperative instability 1 year after the index operation and needed further surgery. No complications were recorded.Selective reconstruction of partial ACL injury is a method to bear in mind because it offers quick functional recovery. Specific technical and diagnostic steps should be performed and discussed with patients preoperatively.Level 4, retrospective study."

A Virtual Population Study,2020-03-27,2020,article,"Internal snapping of the psoas tendon is a frequently reported condition, especially in young adolescents involved in sports. It is defined as an increased tendon excursion over bony or soft tissue prominence causing local irritation and inflammation of the tendon leading to groin pain and often is accompanied by an audible snap. Due to the lack of detailed dynamic visualization means, the exact mechanism of the condition remains poorly understood and different theories have been postulated related to the etiology and its location about the hip In the present study we simulated psoas tendon behavior in a virtual population of 40 000 anatomies and compared tendon movement during combined abduction and external rotation. At risk phenotyopes for tendon snapping were defined as the morphologies presenting with excess tendon movement. There were little differences in tendon movement between the male and female models. In both populations, abnormal tendon excursion correlated with changes in mainly the femoral anatomy (male r 0.72, p < 1e-300, female r 0.66, p < 1e-300): increased anteversion, valgus and medial bowing. The observed combination of shape components correlating with excess tendon movement further presented with a decreasing ischiofemoral distance by a profound medial positioning of the minor trochanter. This finding suggest that psoas snapping and ischiofemoral impingement are possibly two presentations of a similar underlying rotational dysplasia of the femur."

Methods A systematic search was conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for English articles published from 1998 to 2018. The PICO strategy guided the assessment of study relevance and the bibliographical search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort), (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3) a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort). The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work & Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise. Within this domain, there was strong evidence of a positive effect of workplace strength training. There was limited evidence for ergonomics and strong evidence for no benefit of participatory ergonomics, multifaceted interventions, and stress management. No intervention domains were associated with ""negative effects"". Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers. As these interventional domains were very heterogeneous, it should also be recognized that general conclusions about their effectiveness should be done with care.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42018116752 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=116752)."

It plays a key role in modelling human sensorimotor control, and can be used to assess the condition of healthy and neurologically affected individuals. This paper reports the estimation of hip joint viscoelasticity during voluntary force control using a novel device that applies a leg displacement without constraining the hip joint. The influence of hip angle, applied limb force and perturbation direction on the stiffness and viscosity values was studied in ten subjects. No difference was detected in the hip joint stiffness between the dominant and non-dominant legs, but a small dependency was observed on the perturbation direction. Both hip stiffness and viscosity increased monotonically with the applied force magnitude, with posture being observed to have a slight influence. These results are in line with previous measurements carried out on upper limbs, and can be used as a baseline for lower limb movement simulation and further neuromechanical investigations."

Tightness of hamstrings produces decreased range of motion and reduce flexibility of the pelvis, hip and knee joints which can lead to musculoskeletal injuries. Muscle energy technique (MET) also known as active muscular relaxation technique is effective for lengthening a shortened muscles and increasing the range of motion. It is found that neuro dynamic tension technique also affects muscle flexibility and stretch tolerance. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediate effect of muscle energy technique verses non ballistic active knee extension in neural slump position on hamstring flexibility in young adults. Materials and Method : 60 healthy individuals between the age group of 18-35 years with bilateral hamstring tightness without any previous musculoskeletal injuries were allocated into 2 groups by means of quasi random sampling. Hamstring tightness was measured using active knee extension (AKE) test. Group A was given neural slump stretch and group B was given muscle energy technique. Results: For within group data analysis Wilcoxon test was applied where Group A and Group B showed statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.001) in pre and post hamstring flexibility. Mann Whitney U test was used for between group analysis in which Group A(mean rank 35.22) showed a greater improvement than Group B (mean rank 25.78). Conclusion: Both the techniques showed statistical as well as clinical significance in improving hamstring flexibility, however non ballistic active knee extension in neural slump position showed greater improvement than MET."

Survey data suggests that children and adults spend much of their leisure on screen media, including use of social media and video services. Despite much public debate on possible harmful effects of such behavioral shifts, evidence from rigorously conducted randomized controlled trials in free-living settings, investigating the efficacy of reducing screen media use on physical activity, sleep, and physiological stress, is still lacking. Therefore, a family and home-based randomized controlled trial-the SCREENS trial-is being conducted. Here we describe in detail the rationale and protocol of this study. Methods: The SCREENS pilot trial was conducted during the fall of 2018 and spring of 2019. Based on experiences from the pilot study, we developed a protocol for a parallel group randomized controlled trial. The trial is being conducted from May 2019 to ultimo 2020 in 95 families with children 4-14 years recruited from a population-based survey. As part of the intervention family members must handover most portable devices for a 2-week time frame, in exchange for classic mobile phones (not smartphones). Also, entertainment-based screen media use during leisure must be limited to no more than 3 hours/week/person. At baseline and follow-up, 7-day 24-h physical activity will be assessed using two triaxial accelerometers; one at the right hip and one the middle of the right thigh. Sleep duration will be assessed using a single channel EEG-based sleep monitor system. Also, to assess physiological stress (only assessed in adults), parameters of 24-h heart rate variability, the cortisol awakening response and diurnal cortisol slope will be quantified using data sampled over three consecutive days. During the study we will objectively monitor the families' screen media use via different software and hardware monitoring systems. Discussion: Using a rigorous study design with state-of-the-art methodology to assess outcomes and intervention compliance, analyses of data from the SCREENS trial will help answer important causal questions of leisure screen media habits and its short-term influence on physical activity, sleep, and other health related outcomes among children and adults.

https://openalex.org/W3002811858,The correlation between jump height and mechanical power in a countermovement jump is artificially inflated,2020-03-23,2020,article,"The countermovement jump is commonly used to assess an athlete's neuromuscular capacity. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism behind the strong correlation between jump height and mechanical power in a countermovement jump. Three athletes each performed between 47 and 60 maximal-effort countermovement jumps on a force platform. For all three athletes, peak mechanical power and average mechanical power were strongly correlated with jump height (r = 0.54–0.90). The correlation between jump height and peak power was largely determined by the correlation between jump height and the velocity at peak power (r = 0.83–0.94) and was not related to the correlation between jump height and the ground reaction force at peak power (r = −0.20–0.18). These results confirm that the strong correlation between jump height and power is an artefact arising from how power is calculated. Power is a compound variable calculated from the product of instantaneous ground reaction force and instantaneous velocity, and application of statistical theory shows that the correlation between jump height and power is artificially inflated by the near-perfect correlation between jump height and the velocity at peak power. Despite this finding, mechanical power might still be useful in assessing the neuromuscular capacity of an athlete."

The current study aimed to investigate the relation between sports participation hours, type/ number of sports engaged, self-rated competitiveness and knee symptoms among undergraduates. Methods Undergraduates were invited to participate in a self-administered online survey through invitation emails. Respondents were instructed to provide demographic information (e.g., age, gender, sports participation hours, types of engaged sports, self-rated competitiveness in sports and anxiety level etc.) and to report knee symptoms (current, the last 7 days, the last 12 months, and lifetime). Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to investigate the association between sports participation and current knee symptoms. Results Of 17,552 invitees, 3744 responded to the survey. Valid data from 3053 respondents was used for analysis. Forty-four percent of the respondents engaged in sports regularly (≥once per week). Running, cross-training and swimming were the most frequently participated sports among the respondents. The current prevalence rate of knee symptoms was 6.4%. Hours spent participating in combat sports, soccer, yoga, and basketball participation hours were significantly associated with current knee symptoms. Respondents who rated themselves as “competitive” demonstrated a higher risk of having current knee symptoms than “recreational” players. Number of engaged sports was not associated with current knee symptoms among undergraduates. Conclusions Certain sports types were associated with current knee symptoms. Compared to self-rated “recreational” players, self-rated “competitive” players were more likely to have current knee symptoms. Students should take preventive measures to minimize their risk of developing knee symptoms, especially when participating in combat sports, soccer, yoga, and basketball, or engaging in sports at a highly competitive level."
https://openalex.org/W3012685050,A PROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY ON MRI EVALUATION OF INTERNAL DERANGEMENTS OF THE KNEE JOINT,2020-03-23,2020,article,"Introduction: Internal derangements of knee joint constitute a major source of morbidity in patients attending orthopaedic outpatients department of our hospital. It includes a group of disorders due to disruption of normal functioning of ligaments and menisci of knee joint leading to persistent or intermittent signs and symptoms such as pain, instability, or abnormal mobility of the knee. MRI would be a noninvasive, nonoperator dependent effective modality for early detection of these pathologies and has very high negative predictive value.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was carried out over a period of one year from April 2018 to April 2019. Fifty patients with clinically suspected internal derangement of knee were included in this prospective study. They were evaluated with detailed clinical history and clinical examinations and were subsequently subjected to imaging of knee using 1.5 T HDxt 8 Channel GE MRI machine.&#x0D; Results: ACL was the commonest ligament to be injured with partial tear being more common than complete tear. MCL was the commonest ligament to be torn in association with ACL. Indirect signs of ACL injury were evaluated and helped to corroborate the tears. Meniscal injury was common in medial meniscus and predominantly involved the posterior horn. In lateral meniscus anterior horn was involved more than posterior horn. In both the meniscus horizontal tear was the most common. Certain pattern of associations of injuries was found such as ACL tear with posterolateral corner injury. &#x0D; Interpretation and Conclusion: MR is an excellent tool for evaluation of ligaments, menisci and osseous structures of knee joint. Various clinical tests and appropriate clinical history complements MR examination. Similarly MR imaging of knee complements therapeutic arthroscopies and would greatly reduce the need of diagnostic arthroscopies. Thus MR is a non-invasive, painless and morbidity-free modality for accurate preoperative assessment that is well accepted by patients."

Previous studies have shown a correlation between knee kinematics when landing from a jump and this injury. The purpose of this study was to validate the ability of a commercially available inertial measurement units (IMUs) to accurately measure knee joint angles during a dynamic movement. Eight healthy subjects participated in the study. Validation was performed by comparing the angles measured by the wearable device to those obtained through the gold standard motion capture system when landing from a jump. Root mean square, linear regression analysis, and Bland–Altman plots were performed/constructed. The mean difference between the wearable device and the motion capture data was 8.4° (flexion/extension), 4.9° (ab/adduction), and 3.9° (rotation). In addition, the device was more accurate at smaller knee angles. In our study, a commercially available wearable IMU was able to perform fairly well under certain conditions and was less accurate in other conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3012307310,Orientation of the Head and Trunk During Functional Upper Limb Movement,2020-03-20,2020,article,"Upper limb activities imply positioning of the head with respect to the visual target and may impact trunk posture. However, the postural constraints imposed on the neck remains unclear. We used kinematic analysis to compare head and trunk orientation during arm movements (pointing) with isolated movements of the head (heading). Ten right-handed healthy adults completed both experimental tasks. In the heading task, subjects directed their face toward eight visual targets placed over a wide frontal workspace. In the pointing task, subjects pointed to the same targets (each with their right arm). Movements were recorded using an electromagnetic spatial tracking system. Both orientation of the head and trunk in space (Euler angles) and orientation of the head relative to the trunk were extracted. The orientation of the head in space was closely related to target direction during both tasks. The trunk was relatively stable during heading but contributed to pointing, with leftward axial rotation. These findings illustrate that the neck compensates for trunk rotation during pointing, engaging in specific target-dependent 3D movement in order to preserve head orientation in space. Future studies may investigate neck kinematics of people experiencing neck pain in order to identify and correct inefficient movement patterns, particularly in athletes."

To this end, 198 national league players (17.56 ± 0.78 years) performed various tests to measure jump capacity, kicking velocity and sprint times immediately pre-match (T1), at half-time (T2) and post-match (T3). Tests included kicking the ball to measure ball velocity (KICK), sprinting for 40 meters, timing the first 30 meters (30mACCEL), the last 10 meters (10mACCEL) and the total distance (40mACCEL), and performing countermovement jumps (CMJ). For subsequent analysis, the sample was divided into 5 playing positions: goalkeepers (n = 24), defenders (n = 51), midfielders (n = 36), wingers (n = 54) and forwards (n = 33). For all positions, we found a significant decline in performance (p<0.05) for kicking velocity (2.91% - 6.51%) and sprinting (0.44%-5.85%). For the CMJ, all positions except defenders presented a significant decline in performance that ranged from 1.5% to 4.56%. These findings highlight the need to individualise fitness training, taking into account the match needs and demands of the different playing positions in order to minimise the effects of match fatigue and accelerate post-match recovery."

Twenty-five recreationally active participants (male: 16, female: 9) were randomly assigned into a foam rolling (FR) or a dynamic warm up group (CON) (age: 22.8 ± 3.9 years, body mass 75.9 ± 13.2 kg, stretch stature: 174.1 ± 10.1 cm). In a randomised crossover design, each participant completed two experimental sessions that were separated by seven days. Ankle range of movement was assessed while using a weight-bearing lunge test and drop jump performance was recorded via bilateral force plates. Following a 5 min cycle, the foam rolling group undertook self-myofascial release to the lower limb and thoracic/lumbar regions, followed by a dynamic warm up. The control group undertook the same initial warm up plus the dynamic exercises. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. There was a significant increase (p < 0.001) in ankle range of motion immediately after the warm up for both groups (pre CON: 37.5 ± 5.31, post CON: 39.8 ± 5.76; pre FR 38.7 ± 7, post FR: 40.3 ± 7.3 deg). No significant difference was found between the conditions (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences for any indices of jump performance (p > 0.05). Based on these results, foam rolling plus dynamic exercises does not appear to impair or enhance drop jump performance, despite the increases in ankle range of movement."

As can be seen from the scientific literature, there are many studies that have described risk factors, but above all what strategies can be used to decrease this incidence through the prevention exercises. The exercise considered the gold standard for the hamstring injuries prevention is the Nordic hamstring although the literature highlights the particular complexity of the anatomical district of hamstrings. For these reasons, it seems simplistic and reductive to assume that one exercise is sufficient. In this study is proposed further exercises proposed in the literature that can integrate the traditional Nordic hamstring and help to activate more fully all the muscle heads that make up the hamstrings. In conclusion, in a prevention session or in a strength session, in addition to the Nordic hamstring exercise, other exercises could be included, such as the Laying Kick, the Standing Kick, the Nordic bump, the Nordic with return, the Cranes and the Cranes return."

https://openalex.org/W3010804760,Read-the-game: System for skill-based visual exploratory activity assessment with a full body virtual reality soccer simulation,2020-03-17,2020,article,"We present a novel virtual reality (VR) system to measure soccer players' read-the-game ability. Read-the-game is a term that encompasses a conglomerate of visual exploratory behavioral patterns and cognitive elements required to make accurate in-game decisions. Our technological approach in the Sports Science domain focuses on the visuomotor component of targeted skill development in a VR simulation because VR is a powerful perception-action coupling training solution for visuomotor coordination due to its high sense of immersion and its psychological byproduct presence. Additionally, we analyze two critical aspects: psychological (i.e., sense of presence) and the human-computer interaction (HCI) domain (i.e., suitable input device for full-body immersion). To measure head movements related to visual explorations, the system tracks the user's head excursions. Specifically, the engaged visual exploratory activity (VEA) during a VR simulation is measured frame-by-frame at runtime to study the behavior of players making passing decisions while experiencing pressure from rivals during in-game situations recreated with computer graphics (CG). Additionally, the sense of presence elicited by our system is measured via the Igroup Presence Questionnaire applied to beginner and amateur soccer players (n = 24). Regarding the HCI aspect, a comparison of input options reveals that a high presence can be achieved when using full body interactions that integrate head and body motions via a combination of an HMD and kinetic body tracking. During our system verification, a difference in the VEA performance is observed between beginner and amateur players. Moreover, we demonstrate the capacity of the system to measure the VEA while evoking immersive soccer in-match experiences with a portable VR setup."

Healthy females (n=24) who were recreationally active performed drop-land-lateral jump and straight run tasks. Three-dimensional whole-body kinematics, ground reaction forces, and muscle activation patterns from eight lower limb muscles were collected concurrently during both tasks, but only the jump was analyzed computationally, with the run included for model calibration. External biomechanics, muscle-tendon unit kinematics, and muscle activation patterns were used to model lower limb muscle and ACL forces. Peak ACL force (2.3±0.5 BW) was observed at 13% of the stance phase during the drop-land-lateral jump task. The ACL force was primarily developed through the sagittal plane, and muscle was the dominant source of ACL loading. The gastrocnemii and quadriceps were main ACL antagonists (i.e., loaders), while hamstrings were the main ACL agonists (i.e., supporters)."

For an adequate and useful practice, physical activity professionals should understand how different types of CP profiles constrain the performance of motor skills that are required during sports practice. This study aims to develop an observation-based assessment tool to evaluate activity limitations in individuals with a moderate level of CP when performing skills requiring jumping, sprinting, change of direction, coordination, and balance. Nineteen observers with different backgrounds from five world regions were recruited for this study, with accredited experience classifying/observing para-athletes with CP. All observers watched videos of 20 international para-athletes with different CP profiles (bilateral spasticity, athetosis/ataxia, unilateral spasticity; all Gross Motor Function Classification System level I) performing 16 motor tasks, and their observations were recorded throughout an ad-hoc data collection instrument. A total of 6080 units of qualitative information were recorded for data analysis. An observation-based tool with qualitative descriptors is derived from data analyses, describing how coordination and balance affected mainly in those with dyskinesia/ataxia, range of movement in those with diplegia, and asymmetries in those with hemiplegia. This tool would help sports practitioners and physical educators to better understand how different CP profiles constrain the performance of motor skills."

Among the non-fatal ones, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most prevalent, as they have reached epidemic proportions. The main aim of this investigation is to systematically review the major risk factors regarding MSDs as well as evaluate the existing ergonomic interventions. Methods: The search engines of Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were used to identify relevant articles during the last decade. The imposed exclusive criteria assured the accuracy and current progress in this field. Results: It was concluded that MSDs affect both developed and developing countries, thus justifying the existing global concern. Overall, the most commonly studied task was harvesting, followed by load carrying, pruning, planting, and other ordinary manual operations. Repetitive movements in awkward postures, such as stooping and kneeling; individual characteristics; as well as improper tool design were observed to contribute to the pathogenesis of MSDs. Furthermore, low back disorders were reported as the main disorder. Conclusions: The present ergonomic interventions seem to attenuate the MSDs to a great extent. However, international reprioritization of the safety and health measures is required in agriculture along with increase of the awareness of the risk factors related to MSDs."

The following 4 ball impact positions were evaluated: standard, posterior, medial, and lateral. The EMG amplitude, normalized to the maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the respective muscles, was compared for each phase of the spiking movement between the standard position and the other 3 different impact positions, using the Dunnett test.The following between-position differences were noted for the deltoid muscle: increased activation of the anterior deltoid during the acceleration phase for the posterior position (P = .041), increase in the posterior deltoid during the acceleration phase for the lateral position (P = .04), and increase in the middle deltoid during the deceleration phase for the lateral position (P = .005).A posterior or lateral shift in the position of ball impact may cause an increase in the activity of the deltoid muscle that would cause a decrease in the centripetal force of the humeral head through the acceleration and deceleration phases. As such, neuromuscular exercises, combined with strengthening of the rotator cuff muscle, might reduce the risk of shoulder injury during performance of the volleyball spiking movement."

Specific variables contributing to the general work-up of a vestibular patient were compared between BV patients experiencing falls and those who did not. Design Prospective multi-centric cohort study. Setting Department of Otorhinolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery at two tertiary referral centers: Antwerp University Hospital and Maastricht University Medical Center. Participants In total, 119 BV patients were included. BV diagnosis was defined in accordance with the diagnostic BV criteria, established by the Bárány Society in 2017. Main outcome measures Patients were divided into fallers and non-fallers, depending on the experience of one or more falls in the preceding 12 months. Residual vestibular function on caloric testing, rotatory chair testing, video head impulse test (vHIT) and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) was evaluated as a predictive factor for falls. Furthermore, hearing function (speech perception in noise (SPIN)), sound localization performance, etiology, disease duration, sport practice, scores on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Oscillopsia Severity Questionnaire (OSQ) were compared between fallers and non-fallers. Results Forty-five (39%) patients reported falls. In a sub-analysis in the patients recruited at UZA (n = 69), 20% experienced three or more falls and three patients (4%) suffered from severe fall-related injuries. The DHI score and the OSQ score were significantly higher in fallers. Residual vestibular function, SPIN, sound localization performance, etiology, disease duration, age and sport practice did not differ between fallers and non-fallers. Conclusions Falls and (severe) fall-related injuries are frequent among BV patients. A DHI score > 47 and an OSQ score > 27.5 might be indicative for BV patients at risk for falls, with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 60%. Residual vestibular function captured by single vestibular tests (vHIT, calorics, rotatory chair, cVEMP) or by overall vestibular function defined as the number of impaired vestibular sensors are not suitable to distinguish fallers and non-fallers in a BV population."

The major problem is sural nerve injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect and advantage of the intraoperative ultrasonography assistance for minimally invasive repair of the acute Achilles tendon rupture. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 36 cases of acute Achilles tendon rupture treated with minimally invasive repair assisted with intraoperative ultrasonography from January 2015 to December 2017. The relationship of the sural nerve and small saphenous vein was confirmed on the preoperative MRI. The course of the small saphenous vein and sural nerve were identified and marked by intraoperative ultrasonography. The ruptured Achilles tendon was repaired with minimally invasive Bunnell suture on the medial side of the SSV. Results: All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. No sural nerve injury or other complications was found intraoperatively and postoperatively. All the patients returned to work and light sporting activities at a mean of 12.78±1.40 weeks and 17.28±2.34 weeks, respectively. The Mean AOFAS scores improved from 59.17±5.31 preoperatively to 98.92±1.63 at the time of 12 months follow-up. There was statistically significant difference ( P &lt;0.001). No patient complained a negative effect on their life. Conclusions: The minimally invasive repair assisted with intraoperative ultrasonography can yield good clinical outcomes, less surgical time and less complications, especially sural nerve injury. It is an efficient, reliable and safe method for acute AT rupture."
https://openalex.org/W3009782946,Which assessments are used to analyze neuromuscular control by electromyography after an anterior cruciate ligament injury to determine readiness to return to sports? A systematic review,2020-03-08,2020,review,"Abstract Background Adequate neuromuscular control of the knee could be one element to prevent secondary injuries after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. To assess neuromuscular control in terms of time, amplitude and activity, electromyography (EMG) is used. However, it is unclear which assessments using EMG could be used for a safe return to sports (RTS). Therefore, we aimed to summarize EMG-related assessments for neuromuscular control of the knee in adult patients after an ACL injury to decide upon readiness for RTS. Methods This systematic review followed guidelines of Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane recommendations. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), SPORTDiscus and the Web of Science were searched from inception to March 2019 and updated in November 2020. Studies identifying electromyographic assessments for neuromuscular control during dynamic tasks in adult, physically active patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury were eligible and qualitatively synthesized. Two independent reviewers used a modified Downs and Black checklist to assess risk of bias of included studies. Results From initially 1388 hits, 38 mainly cross-sectional, case-controlled studies were included for qualitative analysis. Most studies provided EMG outcomes of thigh muscles during jumping, running or squatting. Outcomes measures described neuromuscular control of the knee in domains of time, amplitude or activity. Risk of bias was medium to high due to an unclear description of participants and prior interventions, confounding factors and incompletely reported results. Conclusions Despite a wide range of EMG outcome measures for neuromuscular control, none was used to decide upon return to sports in these patients. Additional studies are needed to define readiness towards RTS by assessing neuromuscular control in adult ACL patients with EMG. Further research should aim at finding reliable and valid, EMG-related variables to be used as diagnostic tool for neuromuscular control. Moreover, future studies should aim at more homogenous groups including adequately matched healthy subjects, evaluate gender separately and use sport-specific tasks. Registration The protocol for this systematic review was indexed beforehand in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and registered as CRD42019122188."

Over 150 youth football athletes completed the SAC and a brief battery of NIH Toolbox cognitive tests as part of a larger study on biomechanical factors in youth sport concussion. This was a within-subjects design (pre-season, post-season assessments), and correlational analysis of convergent and discriminant validity. Between groups analysis based on demographic differences was also employed. The pre-season SAC scores were not different by age; however, SAC scores were statistically different by race: t(155) = 3.162, p = .002, d = .519. Maternal level of education and participant vocabulary scores were related to racial group membership. Convergent and discriminant validity were established compared to NIH Toolbox tests of memory and speed. Pre–post-season tests for 108 participants established marginally acceptable test–retest reliability (ICC = .692). These data support the use of the original SAC in youth football although clinicians must be aware of racial differences in scores."
https://openalex.org/W3009358410,Evolutionary Perspectives on the Developing Skeleton and Implications for Lifelong Health,2020-03-04,2020,review,"Osteoporosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in contemporary populations. This common disease of aging results from a state of bone fragility that occurs with low bone mass and loss of bone quality. Osteoporosis is thought to have origins in childhood. During growth and development, there are rapid gains in bone dimensions, mass, and strength. Peak bone mass is attained in young adulthood, well after the cessation of linear growth, and is a major determinant of osteoporosis later in life. Here we discuss the evolutionary implications of osteoporosis as a disease with developmental origins that is shaped by the interaction among genes, behavior, health status and the environment during the attainment of peak bone mass. Studies of contemporary populations show that growth, body composition, sexual maturation, physical activity, nutritional status and dietary intake are determinants of childhood bone accretion, and provide context for interpreting bone strength and osteoporosis in skeletal populations. Studies of skeletal populations demonstrate the role of subsistence strategies, social context, and occupation in the development of skeletal strength. Comparisons of contemporary living populations and archeological skeletal populations suggest declines in bone density and strength that have been occurring since the Pleistocene. Aspects of western lifestyles carry implications for optimal peak bone mass attainment and lifelong skeletal health, from increased longevity to circumstances during development such as obesity and sedentism. In light of these considerations, osteoporosis is a disease of contemporary human evolution and evolutionary perspectives provide a key lens for interpreting the changing global patterns of osteoporosis in human health."
https://openalex.org/W3009925853,Player–surface interactions: perception in elite soccer and rugby players on artificial and natural turf,2020-03-04,2020,article,"Artificial turf (AT) is common at all levels of soccer and rugby. Employing an interdisciplinary design, this study aimed to examine the extent to which the negative attitude commonly expressed by players concerning AT is based on the difference in technique between AT and natural turf (NT), or due to pre-existing biases. Thirty professional soccer and rugby players performed a defined set of movements with masked and normal perception conditions on NT and AT. Two-dimensional kinematic analysis (100 Hz) of characteristics in parallel to a psychological assessment of the impact of cognitive bias for a playing surface was assessed. No significant interaction effects between the level of perception and surface type were found. For AT, contact time (CT) was shorter across conditions, while for NT rugby players had longer CT during acceleration/deceleration phases and shorter flight times. Pre-existing negative bias against AT was found during the normal perception trials in the technology acceptance model (Usefulness and Ease of Use) and the general preference questions on how much the athlete would like to play a game on it. The results suggest that opinion was not driven by surface characteristics, but by a cognitive bias, players brought with them to the pitch."

Even the most basic motor skill of walking requires years to develop and can quickly deteriorate due to aging and sedentary lifestyles. More specialized skills such as ballet and acrobatic kicks in soccer require “talent” and years of extensive practice to fully master. These practices can easily cause injuries if conducted improperly. 3D motion capture technologies are currently the best way to acquire human motor skill in biomechanical feedback training. Owing to their tremendous promise for a plethora of applications, wearable technologies have garnered great interest in biofeedback training. Using wearable technology, some physical activity parameters can be tracked in real time and a noninvasive way to indicate the physical progress of a trainee. Yet, the application of biomechanical wearables in human motor-skill learning, training, and optimization is still in its infant phase due to the absence of a reliable method. This chapter elaborates challenges faced by developing wearable biomechanical feedback devices and forecasts potential breakthroughs in this area. The overarching goal is to foster interdisciplinary studies on wearable technology to improve how we move."

ACL injury impairs neuromuscular function and psychological readiness putting alpine skiers with ACL injury at high risk for ACL reinjury. Consequently, return to sport training and testing protocols are recommended to safeguard ACL injured athletes against reinjury. The aim of this paper was to present a real-world example of a return to sport training plan for a female elite alpine ski racer who sustained an ACL injury that was supported by an interdisciplinary performance team (IPT) alongside neuromuscular testing and athlete monitoring. A multi-faceted return to sport training plan was developed by the IPT shortly after the injury event that accounted for the logistics, healing, psychological readiness, functional milestones, work capacity and progression to support the return to sport/return to performance transition. Neuromuscular testing was conducted at several timepoints post-injury. Importantly, numerous pre-injury tests provided a baseline for comparison throughout the recovery process. Movement competencies and neuromuscular function were assessed, including an evaluation of muscle properties (e.g. the force-velocity and force-length relationships) to assist the IPT in pinpointing trainable deficits and managing the complexities of the return to sport transition. While the athlete returned to snow 7 months post-injury, presenting with interlimb asymmetries below 10%, functional and strength deficits persisted up to 18-months post-injury. More research is required to establish a valid return to sport protocol for alpine ski racers with ACL injury to safeguard against the high risk for ACL reinjury."

Irrational beliefs (IBs) may be one such antecedent to ""choking"", given that irrational beliefs are closely associated with anxiety intensity. This study aimed to investigate whether IBs influenced anxiety and performance under pressure. Experienced Australian football players (N = 35) completed an IBs questionnaire prior to an Australian football set shot experiment with low- and high-pressure. During both pressure conditions, participants completed a state anxiety questionnaire prior to completing 15 set shots on goal. Results indicated that cognitive and somatic anxiety increased from low- to high-pressure. For somatic anxiety, an IBs main effect approached significance, indicating higher somatic anxiety with increases in IBs. A marginally significant Condition main effect was found for performance, which decreased from low- to high-pressure, with no other effects for performance evident. Follow-up correlation analysis of seven athletes who likely experienced choking (i.e., greater than 15-point performance decrease) indicated a strong negative correlation between IBs and change in performance from low- to high-pressure. Further analyses for ""chokers"" indicated a significant IBs × Condition interaction, with performance tending to increase with increasing IBs under low-pressure and decrease with increasing IBs under high-pressure. This study provides initial, tentative support that IBs associated with performance trends of ""chokers"" under different pressure conditions may be dissimilar to those of ""underperformers"" or ""clutch"" performers. Applied implications for sport psychologists working with athletes are discussed.Lay summary: This paper investigated whether inflexible thoughts (i.e., irrational beliefs- IBs) led to increased anxiety and ""choking"". Athletes completed an IBs questionnaire, then an anxiety survey during a football kicking task under low- and high-pressure. Results indicated IBs may affect ""chokers"" response to pressure differently to other groups."

Whereas the majority of AC joint dislocations can be treated nonoperatively with a trial of immobilization, pain medication, cryotherapy, and physiotherapy, there are patients that do not respond well to conservative management and may require surgical treatment. Identifying and treating these patients according to the type and chronicity of AC joint dislocation is paramount. To date, a myriad of surgical techniques have been proposed to address unstable AC joint dislocations and are indicative of the uncertainty that exists in optimal management of these injuries. Historically research has focused on the restoration of the coracoclavicular ligament complex. However, recently the importance of the acromioclavicular capsule and ligaments has been emphasized. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of current treatment strategies and research, as well as future perspectives.

Our objective was to review the outcomes after arthroscopic fixation for acute AC joint dislocation using the TightRope device.We reviewed the records of 52 patients, with a mean age of 31 years, who underwent arthroscopic fixation with the TightRope device for acute AC joint dislocation. Outcomes were evaluated using the Constant and University of California, Los Angeles scores. The coracoclavicular (CC) distance before and after surgery was compared by radiography.The mean follow-up period was 36.7 months (range, 6-65 months). Postoperatively, the mean Constant score was 97.13 and the mean University of California, Los Angeles score was 33.2. The CC distance was maintained in 73% of the patients, whereas partial loss of reduction occurred in 19.2% and failure of reduction occurred in 7.7%.Arthroscopic fixation using the TightRope device for acute AC joint dislocation achieves satisfactory clinical outcomes. However, CC reconstruction appears to result in subluxation in cases with AC dislocation for a period of more than 10 days."

Football is a vigorous sport, and physical collision and damage are frequent during competition and training. In order to improve football skills and prevent sports injuries, 10 athletes from Sport College of Shaoyang University, Hunan, China, were tested for isokinetic muscle strength. The moment of flexors and extensors was measured when the flexion and extension angular speed of hip and knee joints was 50 ∘ , 100 ∘ , 150 ∘ , 200 ∘ , 250 ∘ , 300 ∘ , 350 ∘ and 400 ∘ , respectively. Moreover the characteristics of force moment of flexor and extensor were verified by testing the electromyographic signal of the flexor and extensor of the hip and knee joints with isokinetic concentric exercise using piezoelectric sensor. The results showed that the electromyographic signal of the flexor and extensor of the hip and knee joint decreased with the increase of angular velocity of isokinetic concentric exercise; the electromyographic signal obtained by the piezoelectric sensor verified the law that the output of the flexor and extensor decreased, the extensor of the hip joint had incoordination during rapid movement, and the output of the extensor was always larger than that of the flexor no matter how fast the extensor moved."
https://openalex.org/W4205222988,In Memoriam: Duncan Dowson (1928–2020),2020-03-01,2020,article,"It is with great regret that we have to inform the readers of our Journal that Professor Duncan Dowson, the Honorary Editor of our Journal, has passed away at age 91 (6 January 2020). He had not been feeling well in the last few years and his condition was worsened after a fall. He died in hospital on 6th January 2020. This is a great loss to all of us, particularly in the biotribology community and we will remember him as one of the greatest biotribologists of our time. Professor Duncan Dowson was born on 31st August 1928 in Yorkshire, UK. He studied an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds from 1947 to 1950. He continued his postgraduate study at the same institution and obtained a PhD for his thesis on ‘Cavitation in Lubricating Films Supporting Small Loads’ in 1952. He became a Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering in 1954, a Senior Lecturer in 1963, a Reader in 1965 and a Professor of Engineering Fluid Mechanics and Tribology in 1966: the world's first holder of a Chair of Tribology. He remained active in research as an Emeritus Professor at the University of Leeds after his retirement on 30th September 1993. Professor Dowson has made a remarkably distinguished contribution to the scientific study and engineering application in the area of Tribology. One of his particular contributions in this field is in Biotribology, a subject that he introduced in 1970 to cover aspects of tribology concerned with biological systems [[1]]. He was particularly supportive of the research developments in this field. He kindly wrote the Foreword for the ‘Dental Biotribology’ authored by the Editor in 2013 [[2]]. ‘The role of tribology in the functioning of biological systems is attracting much attention at the present time. This arises partly from the inherent curiosity of tribologists about the role of fundamental aspects of their subject in the biological world, but also from the recognition that nature's solution to problems might guide tribologists in their search for new approaches to engineering problems. Biotribology and biomimetics have thus united in recent times’. According to our own accounts, of a total of 616 of his scientific publications, approximately half (301) were dedicated to the area of Biotribology. He published his first paper in Biotribology [[4]] and organised the first Symposium (Institution of Mechanical Engineers, UK) [[5]] on the topic of human synovial joints and artificial replacements in 1966, a study that has inspired so many researchers (including two Associated Editors of our Journal) and remained actively investigated till the present time. From the very beginning, he recognised the importance of clinical and medical inputs into this area and had established close collaborations with clinicians including the late Professor Verna Wright, the late Sir John Charnley, Professor Mike Wroblewski etc. Together with many of his postgraduate students and colleagues, he investigated a number of interesting clinical problems, such as joint stiffness, walking activities, and also a cracking joint that has received significant attention recently [[6]]. His publications on both biomechanics and biotribology of synovial joints and replacements included the hip, the knee, the elbow, the shoulder, the ankle and the finger as well as other interesting topics such as heart values, the fat pat, menisci, football boots etc. Many of us know his work on the theoretical and computational analyses of fluid film lubrication, but he also carried out many experimental studies, particularly in the area of the lubrication of articular cartilage and synovial fluid in synovial joints and the wear of the bearing surfaces of artificial replacements. The importance of joint simulators was recognised in his early studies with the design of joint simulators which are now widely and routinely used for pre-clinical testing of artificial joint replacements. Duncan Dowson's contribution in Tribology and Biotribology has also been recognised through professional and academic distinctions. He has received many Honorary Doctorates from UK and around the world including Sweden, France, Belgium, Canada etc. He served as the President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK in 1992–3 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1982 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1987. He received the Order of the Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989. In addition, he received many distinguished awards and medals, including the highest in Tribology, the Tribology Gold Medal in 1979. Professor Dowson was closely associated with and very supportive of our Journal. The subject of Biotribology he introduced in 1970 is now one of the main scopes of our Journal. He met with the Editor (ZRZ) and one of the Associated Editors (ZMJ) of the Journal in Leeds in 2008 (Fig. 1) and had useful discussions about the establishment of our Journal. He kindly agreed to serve as the Honorary Editor and wrote the Preface in the first issue of our Journal in March 2015 (6). In the Preface, he highlighted the importance of this subject: Taken during the 35th Leeds – Lyon Symposium on Tribology, Leeds, 9–12 September 2008 (ZRZ in the middle and ZMJ one the left) ‘...the sheer excitement and challenge of applying knowledge and experience developed over many years in engineering and materials science to the understanding and solution of corresponding problems in biology and medicine.’ ‘...are immense, starting with the separation at school of life science subjects from mathematics, physics and chemistry at an early stage in several educational systems. Inadequate communication and understanding between practitioners with vastly different backgrounds remain major issues’. ‘It has taken another forty five years for specialist Journals in this field to emerge (from 1966 when the term ‘Tribology’ was listed in international dictionaries and defined simply as ‘The Science and technology of interacting surfaces in relative motion and the practices related thereto’) although more general Journals have encouraged publications in this field. The field covered by ‘Biosurface and Biotribology’ are immense, fascinating and diverse.’ Professor Dowson was kind and gentle, and always smiled. Those of us who have studied under his supervision, worked with him or simply talked to him will remember his immense knowledge and valuable advices provided to us all."

Such movements and tasks are typically represented in a VE using either a first-person perspective (1PP) or a third-person perspective (3PP). In Virtual Reality (VR), 1PP is almost universally used. 3PP can be represented as either egocentric or allocentric. However, there is little empirical evidence about which view may be better suited to dynamic tasks in particular. This paper compares the use of 1PP, egocentric 3PP and allocentric 3PP for dynamic tasks in VR. Our results indicate that 1PP provides the best spatial perception and performance across several dynamic tasks. This advantage is less pronounced as the task becomes more dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W4389941927,Skier's Edge: Biomechanical Analysis,2020-03-01,2020,dissertation,"The Skier’s Edge trainer can be used by novice or expert skiers. Testing was performed to analyze if the use of the Skier’s Edge could reduce in shear forces of the valgus moment on the knee joint and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) due to lesser fatigue of muscle and a higher hamstring to quadricep (H/Q) ratio activity. This leads to a reduction of improper form and an increase in balance. Experiments performed observed the change in muscle activity with the use of the Skier’s Edge over time when compared to other forms of workout (elliptical and or a traditional ski conditioning workout). Comparison of the three workout methods was completed by collecting kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic (EMG) data. Each participant, 9 male skiers (22±3 years old, 70.56±3.44 inches, 206±54 lbs.) and 6 female skiers (22±4 years old, 66.25±3.25 inches, 148±72 lbs.), were separated into even groups between the workout types. Data was collected initially and after a four-week period of exercise for each respective workout group. A relative valgus moment was found with the force and valgus angle data and an H/Q ratio was created using the vastus medialis and semitendinosus EMG data for the respective muscles. The findings of this study show that there were no significant differences between the workout types for either reduction of valgus moment or an increase in H/Q ratio which are indicators of reduced ACL injury. Trends in the data indicate that the elliptical workout may have a positive impact on H/Q when compared to the Skier’s Edge workout. Recommendation for future study includes having participants complete a more intense and longer workout period or to focus on the elliptical and Skier’s Edge workout to test for significant differences to aid in ACL injury reduction."

New categories for coding were agreed on in the ‘International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus statement: Methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sports 2020.’ We explain the process for determining the new categories and update both the Sport Medicine Diagnostic Coding System (SMDCS) and the Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System (OSIICS) with new versions that operationalise the new consensus categories. The author group included members from an expert group attending the IOC consensus conference. The primary authors of the SMDCS (WM) and OSIICS (JO) produced new versions that were then agreed on by the remaining authors using expert consensus methodology. The SMDCS and OSIICS systems have been adjusted and confirmed through a consensus process to align with the IOC consensus statement to facilitate translation between the two systems. Problematic areas for defining body part categories included the groin and ankle regions. For illness codes, in contrast to the ICD, we elected to have a taxonomy of ‘organ system/region’ (eg, cardiovascular and respiratory), followed by an ‘aetiology/pathology’ (eg, environmental, infectious disease and allergy). Companion data files have been produced that provide translations between the coding systems. The similar structure of coding underpinning the OSIICS and SMDCS systems aligns the new versions of these systems with the IOC consensus statement and also facilitates easier translation between the two systems. These coding systems are freely available to the sport and exercise research community."

Lower extremity joints powers, moments and angular velocities, were investigated in seven elite goalkeepers diving to save balls, shot from a ball canon to unanticipated heights (high and low) and sides (right and left). Our result showed that there was a proximal-to-distal sequence for each leg in timing of peak joints powers (p<0.05). Hip extensors produced the largest (p<0.05) peak moment, the contralateral (relative to dive side) peak was significantly larger than the ipsilateral one for high (4.56 ±1.02 N·m·kg-1, and 3.52 ±0.79 N·m·kg-1) and low dives (3.52 ±0.79 N·m·kg-1, and 2.52 ±0.56 N·m·kg-1). The ankle plantar flexors produced the second largest peak moment (p<0.05), and the peak ipsilateral ankle power and angular velocity were the largest (p<0.05) of all joints, during high (1502 ±338 W, and 14.73 ±1.36 rad·s-1) and low dives (868 ±263 W, and 14.14 ±3.09 rad·s-1). Strength and conditioning coaches need to focus on hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors, and for specificity in power training that should elicit triple extension of the lower limbs' joints in a proximal-to-distal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W3008225820,Re-thinking pedagogical content knowledge for physical education teachers – implications for physical education teacher education,2020-02-27,2020,article,"Background: In this conceptual paper, we contribute to the discussion of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in physical education and physical education teacher education (PETE). There are two main limitations in the work inspired by Shulman's [1987. ""Knowledge and Teaching: Foundations of the New Reform."" Harvard Educational Review 57 (1): 1–21] concepts content knowledge (CK) and PCK. First, CK is exclusively interpreted as knowledge in and about movement, and excludes knowledge through movement. Second, contemporary understandings of CK and PCK have been mainly from a behaviour analytic perspective. By only adopting a behavioural perspective of CK, i.e. a perspective which aims to change students' behaviours without necessarily changing knowledge or understanding, pre-service teachers are unlikely to reflect on context and culture or how these affect the students with whom they will work.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to add a new perspective to the contemporary discussion of PCK in physical education and PETE through elaborating on how PCK could be conceptualised 'phronetically'. We believe that contextual and situational foci of a phronetic approach constitute an important dimension of teacher knowledge, and that this dimension is not captured or made visible by behaviour analytic discourse of PCK in movement cultures.Method: For the conceptual task of expanding our understanding of PCK, we have been inspired by Thomas [2007. Education and Theory: Strangers in Paradigms. Berkshire: McGraw Hill], Shoemaker, Tankard, and Lasorsa [2004. How to Build Social Science Theories. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage], and Whetten [1989. ""What Constitutes a Theoretical Contribution?"" Journal Academy of Management Review 14 (4): 490–495] and their ideas of building theory through borrowing, reflective thinking, and metaphors.Results: We outline four major assumptions made about PCK in the behaviour analytic research on physical education and PETE: 1. Physical education teachers must know how to perform activities with the correct technique, know the tactics and have knowledge about rules and etiquette; 2. Physical education teachers must know how to detect errors and design task progressions. 3. Physical education teachers must know how to select and modify appropriate tasks as well as give feedback. 4. Physical education teachers' level of CK and PCK can be quantitatively measured.Conclusions: From a phronetic perspective, we suggest that PCK could also involve: contextual characteristics for 'new' and integrative movement cultures; interpretation of students' actions; identification and action on diversity during physical education teaching; development of a sensitivity for morally 'right' actions; and management of uncertainty involved in physical education teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3007091657,Optimal Human Functioning Requires Exercise Across the Lifespan: Mobility in a 1g Environment Is Intrinsic to the Integrity of Multiple Biological Systems,2020-02-27,2020,review,"It is widely acknowledged that achieving and maintaining a healthier lifestyle can be enhanced through regular participation in sport and physical activity. Coevally, a growing number of health professionals regard exercise as a legitimate intervention strategy for those who have lost their health. Exercise has been shown to be effective for overweight or obese individuals, who are at risk to lose their health due to development of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, as well as, infiltration of muscles, bone and other organs with fat, so it can be considered medicine. However, exercise and associated mobility likely also have a strong prevention component that can effectively contribute to the maintenance of the integrity of multiple biological systems for those who do not have overt risk factors or ongoing disease. While prevention is preferred over intervention in the context of disease, it is clear that exercise and associated mobility can be an effective influence. The basis for this positive influence likely lies in the fact that many of our physiological systems are designed to function in the mechanically dynamic and active 1g environment of Earth (e.g., muscles, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bones, and cardiovascular system), and nearly all these systems subscribe to the ""use it or lose it"" paradigm. This conclusion is supported by the changes observed over the past >50 years of space flight and exposure to microgravity conditions. Therefore, the premise advanced is: ""exercise is preventative for loss of health due to age-related decline in the integrity of several physiological systems via constant reinforcement of those systems, and thus, exercise and physical activity are endemic to, essential for, and intrinsic to optimal health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3007930203,Height After Side: Goalkeepers Detect the Vertical Direction of Association-Football Penalty Kicks From the Ball Trajectory,2020-02-27,2020,article,"The present research analyzes the relation between the height of penalty kicks in association football and (a) the probability that goalkeepers stop the ball, (b) the kinematics of the kicker, and (c) the movements of the goalkeeper. We re-analyzed movement registration data that were collected in an experiment (with professional and semi-professional players) that focused on the horizontal direction of the penalties (Lopes et al., 2014). We also digitized and analyzed regular videos of the goalkeepers that were recorded by Lopes et al. (2014) but not analyzed. The present research complements the current understanding of the penalty kick with three main observations. First, goalkeepers save penalties at middle heights more often than low and high penalties. Second, the height of penalties is predicted less clearly than their horizontal direction from the kinematics of penalty takers. Third, goalkeepers tend to initiate the horizontal component of the saving action before the penalty taker contacts the ball, but they initiate the vertical component of the action about 245 ms after the contact. Taken together, these results support the view that goalkeepers make the left-right decision at least partly focusing on the kinematics of the kicker, and that they dynamically decide the vertical aspects of the movement later, focusing on the ball trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W3113526954,ACL Injury Prediction in Footballers Using Landing Error Scoring System (LESS),2020-02-27,2020,article,"Background: The use of clinical field assessment tools is popular in sports rehabilitation settings. The purpose of these tools is not only prediction of injury but also to assist in development of injury prevention programs. Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) is a clinical tool that evaluates biomechanical performance during a jump-landing task with particular focus on aspects related to an increased risk for ACL injury. Objective: Of this study was to find the most common faulty biomechanics in football players. Method: This is an evaluation-based study which predicts the risk of ACL injuries in 30 football players based on their jump landing mechanics. This evaluation was carried out with the help of software Kinovea that helps in analysis of joint kinematics. The data captured with the help of off-the-shelf cameras in frontal and sagittal planes and analysed. The frequency of common errors was identified. Result: It was found out that 20% of the players had poor landing mechanics having maximum errors, 20% had moderate errors, while 13% had good score and 47% had excellent landing mechanics. The most common error was knee valgus at initial contact, stance width wider and knee valgus displacement. Conclusion: LESS is beneficial in identification of faulty biomechanics. LESS when used along with Kinovea helps analyse common jump landing errors. Knee valgus along with internal rotation of tibia was found to be the common error which predisposes footballers to ACL injury."

However, the functional properties of the forefoot and midfoot differ. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of the interface of longitudinal bending stiffness and the ratio of forefoot to midfoot bending stiffness on agility performance and foot biomechanics. A total of 18 male soccer players performed 2 agility tasks in footwear conditions that were systematically modified in forefoot and midfoot bending stiffness. Results revealed that higher longitudinal bending stiffness caused more foot exorotation at the initial ground contact (P < .05), less torsion (P < .001), and an anterior shift in the point of force application during push off (P = .01). In addition, the authors observed decreased forefoot bending (P < .05) and increased torsion (P < .01) in footwear with a higher forefoot-midfoot ratio. Finally, the agility performance was significantly impaired by 1.3% in the condition with the highest forefoot-midfoot ratio (P < .01). The high forefoot-midfoot ratio, that is, a stiff forefoot in combination with a soft midfoot, seemed to shift the flex line from anterior to posterior that may explain the performance impairment."

The influence of sports on social processes has increased, sports began to strengthen its position in public opinion as a prestigious sphere of employment and an important social category [24. P. 60]. Thus, there is an obvious need to identify the relationship of physical culture with society as a whole and with all elements of the social structure and specific social institutions. The article examines the origins and prerequisites for the formation of sociology of sport as a relatively independent scientific discipline; presents the issues of sports sociology in the historical perspective - in the context of both their social genesis and contemporary sociological theories; considers the social role and social functions of sport education and sports. The authors believe that the differentiated social distribution of sports practices is determined by the interconnections of the space of possible practices (supply) and the space of demand for certain practices. In the article, the well-known foreign scientists are presented in the new perspective - as sociologists who provided for both Russian and foreign authors the incentive and direction for theoretical studies of sports issues.

You’re asking the wrong question…,2020-02-21,2020,preprint,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have been a rising concern in the early years of the women’s Australian Football League (AFLW) – eliciting headlines of a “knee crisis” surrounding the league. There has been a focus on female biology as the primary factor driving the high rate of ACL injuries in the AFLW. Emphasising Australian football as being dangerous for females due to their biology may be misrepresenting a root cause of the ACL injury problem, perpetuating gender stereotypes that can restrict physical development and participation of females in the sport. We propose that that a framework addressing environmental and sociocultural factors, along with biological determinants, is required to truly challenge the ACL injury problem in the AFLW. Sports science and medicine must therefore strive to understand the whole system of female Australian football, and question how to address inequities for the benefit of the athletes."

The aim of the framework is to improve the consistency of video analysis work in rugby union and help enhance the overall quality of future research in the sport. To reach consensus, a systematic review and Delphi method study design was used. After a systematic search of the literature, 17 articles were used to develop the final framework that described and defined key actions and events in rugby union (rugby). Thereafter, a group of researchers and practitioners with experience and expertise in rugby video analysis formed the RUVAC group. Each member of the group examined the framework of descriptors and definitions and rated their level of agreement on a 5-point agreement Likert scale (1: strongly disagree; 2: disagree; 3: neither agree or disagree; 4: agree; 5: strongly agree). The mean rating of agreement on the five-point scale (1: strongly disagree; 5: strongly agree) was 4.6 (4.3-4.9), 4.6 (4.4-4.9), 4.7 (4.5-4.9), 4.8 (4.6-5.0) and 4.8 (4.6-5.0) for the tackle, ruck, scrum, line-out and maul, respectively. The RUVAC group recommends using this consensus as the starting framework when conducting rugby video analysis research. Which variables to use (if not all) depends on the objectives of the study. Furthermore, the intention of this consensus is to help integrate video data with other data (eg, injury surveillance)."
https://openalex.org/W3008451893,Lower-Limb Biomechanics in Football Players with and without Hip-related Pain,2020-02-20,2020,article,"ABSTRACT Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the differences in lower-limb biomechanics between adult subelite competitive football players with and without hip-related pain during two contrasting tasks—walking and single-leg drop jump (SLDJ)—and to determine whether potential differences, if present, are sex dependent. Methods Eighty-eight football players with hip-related pain (23 women, 65 men) and 30 asymptomatic control football players (13 women, 17 men) who were currently participating in competitive sport were recruited. Biomechanical data were collected for the stance phase of walking and SLDJ. Pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle angles, as well as the impulse of the external joint moments, were calculated. Differences between groups and sex-specific effects were calculated using linear regression models. Results Compared with their asymptomatic counterparts, football players with hip-related pain displayed a lower average pelvic drop angle during walking ( P = 0.03) and a greater average pelvic hike angle during SLDJ ( P &lt; 0.05). Men with hip-related pain displayed a smaller total range of motion (excursion) for the transverse plane pelvis angle ( P = 0.03) and a smaller impulse of the hip external rotation moment ( P &lt; 0.01) during walking compared with asymptomatic men. Women with hip-related pain displayed a greater total range of motion (excursion) for the sagittal plane knee angle ( P = 0.01) during walking compared with asymptomatic women. Conclusion Overall, few differences were observed in lower-limb biomechanics between football players with and without hip-related pain, irrespective of the task. This outcome suggests that, despite the presence of symptoms, impairments in lower-limb biomechanics during function do not appear to be a prominent feature of people with hip-related pain who are still participating in sport."

https://openalex.org/W3142212979,What’s New in Sports Medicine,2020-02-19,2020,article,"This update reflects recently published evidence in the field of sports medicine surgery mostly from October 2018 through September 2019. Although this review is not exhaustive of all research that might be pertinent to sports medicine, it highlights many key articles that contribute to the existing evidence base in the field of the subspecialty. The most impactful clinical and basic science studies, primarily from The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, and Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, with specific emphasis on Level-I and II studies, have been included in this review. Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) There is still debate among surgeons caring for the highest level of competitive athlete with regard to the best-performing graft choice. A well-performed, single-surgeon, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing patellar tendon (bone-tendon-bone [BTB]) autograft, quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft, and double-bundle reconstruction using hamstring autograft illustrates this debate1. The study included 110 patients in each group with reported 5-year outcomes and 95% final follow-up data. The mean age for all patients was 28.5 years at the time of the surgical procedure. There was no significant difference in patient-reported quality-of-life (Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Quality of Life [ACL-QOL]) score at 5 years between any of the reconstruction groups. However, there was a significantly (nearly 4 times) higher rate of traumatic graft reinjuries in both the hamstring tendon group (15%) and the double-bundle group (16%) compared with the BTB group (4%). As expected, patients in the BTB group had significantly more kneeling pain or anterior knee pain (10%) compared with the hamstring tendon group (4%) and the double-bundle group (2%). The overall return to preinjury level of activity was fairly low at 37% for the entire population, with no significant difference between groups. A meta-analysis of previously performed RCTs was performed to assess whether early ACL reconstruction leads to more complications compared with delayed surgery, especially with regard to stiffness and arthrofibrosis2. Early surgery was defined as <3 weeks after the original injury, and >10 weeks after the injury was considered delayed reconstruction. The investigators included 8 previous studies that included 505 patients with a mean age of 28 years and included a 2.4:1 male-to-female ratio with approximately equal numbers in each group (270 patients in the early reconstruction cohort compared with 235 patients in the delayed surgery cohort). There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcome measures, complications (including motion loss or arthrofibrosis), risk of retear, or instrumented laxity, although the Level of Evidence grade for most of the included studies was low. Furthermore, there was a high degree of heterogeneity among the 8 included studies with regard to rehabilitation protocols, preoperative range of motion, graft choice, and allocation into early or delayed surgical groups. Surgeons using hamstring autografts to perform ACL reconstruction will encounter small-diameter grafts after harvest on occasion. A systematic review of 10 studies (1 Level-II study and 9 Level-III studies) compared ACL reconstructions using hamstring tendon autografts with those using hybrid grafts consisting of hamstring autografts augmented with allograft when the patients’ native hamstring tendons were deemed to be small in diameter3. All studies had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The pooled data included patient-reported outcomes, ACL physical examination tests, KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric) results, and graft failure rates. No significant difference was identified between groups on any of the outcome parameters noted above. There was heterogeneity within the studies in terms of indications or size cutoffs for allograft augmentation. Further study is required to determine what size graft constitutes “too small” for the wide range of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft. Despite the increasing numbers of ACL reconstructions being performed, relatively few data have been published with regard to optimal injury prevention programs or return-to-play criteria. A recently published, well-performed systematic review and meta-analysis of Level-II and Level-III studies investigated whether patients who had undergone successful ACL reconstruction and had passed impartial and criteria-based return-to-sport testing had a reduction in risk of a second ACL injury4. The authors extracted data from each included study (4 total studies met the inclusion criteria) and pooled data for similar return-to-sport tests (i.e., isokinetic testing and hop testing). The data were dichotomized into treatments that “passed” or “failed” on the basis of whether the patient met the return-to-sport criteria and returned to sport or did not meet return-to-sport criteria and returned to sport. Return to sport was defined as the clearance of a patient for full participation in a sport or activity without restriction. Importantly, the investigators performed an analysis of the quality of studies that they included using the modified Downs and Black checklist and also the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) scale showing the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcome being evaluated. There was no significant association between passing objective return-to-sport criteria and risk of a second ACL injury for both graft retear and contralateral ACL tear scenarios. Although not significant, the authors reported an increased incidence of ACL graft reinjury in patients who “failed” return-to-sport criteria (12%) compared with those who passed (6%) and concluded that there may be a protective association present that was not detectable with available data. Return-to-play and rehabilitation guidelines after ACL reconstruction remains unclear in the sports medicine community, and more research is required to help surgeons to better guide patients to a safe return to sport activity. Huang et al. performed a meta-analysis of all previously published RCTs and cluster RCTs of injury prevention programs for ACL injuries5. The study included 8 previous RCTs in this area of study, and their meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction (53%) in ACL injury rate. Although there have been a number of systematic reviews performed on this topic, this study is one of the cleanest analyses to date by including only prior RCTs and addressing the clustering effect bias of the included studies, which often randomized whole (clustered) sports teams. One limitation of the study was that the analysis was largely limited to soccer and may have been less generalizable to other sports. Additionally, the investigators found variability in the specific exercises and the manner of delivery of the injury prevention program across studies. They concluded and advocated for flexibility in the development and implementation of injury prevention programs as a means to achieve more widespread adoption of these programs as the data overwhelmingly support their ability to reduce the rate of ACL injuries. ACL injury prevention is a neglected area of study, and there is an opportunity for substantial improvement in the care of active patients engaging in sports. Meniscus Techniques to improve healing after meniscal repair are an area of great interest. A double-blinded RCT with good methodology was performed in Poland, in which 20 patients (21 menisci) underwent isolated meniscal repair and 20 patients (23 menisci) underwent meniscal repair with a bone marrow venting procedure (BMVP)6. All tears were unstable, complete, vertical tears in the red-white zone (majority bucket-handle tears), and repair was performed with either an all-inside or all-inside plus outside-in vertical mattress technique. A chondral pick device was used to created 6 to 7 awl holes in the lateral aspect of the intercondylar notch for the BMVP group. The 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics and underwent the same postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Meniscal healing was assessed via second-look arthroscopy at a mean time (and standard deviation) of 35 ± 4 weeks by a blinded assessor, demonstrating BMVP-augmented repair healing rates to be superior (100%) to the control group (76%) (p = 0.0035). Follow-up at 32 to 51 months found that secondary pain and functional measures were improved in the BMVP group compared with the control group, and both were better than baseline. Surgeons should consider this simple, quick, and low-cost adjunct in patients undergoing isolated meniscal repairs. The ESCAPE (Early Surgery Versus Conservative Therapy for Meniscal Injuries in Older Patients) Research Group performed a noninferiority, multicenter, non-blinded RCT in patients who were 45 to 70 years of age and had a non-knee-locking meniscal tear and varying degrees of radiographic arthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade, 0 to 3); the authors compared physical therapy with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy7. In this study, 162 patients randomized to physical therapy participated in 16 sessions (30 minutes each) conducted over 8 weeks, whereas 159 patients undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy had the surgical procedure within 4 weeks of randomization and were given a postoperative home exercise protocol. A total of 47 patients in the physical therapy group (29%) crossed over to the surgical procedure group because of persistence of symptoms; 75% of these were within 6 months of randomization. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) function improved 26.2 points in the arthroscopic partial meniscectomy group and 20.4 points in the physical therapy group. The primary mixed model analysis of overall effects up to 24 months found a between-group difference of 3.6 points (97.5% confidence interval [CI], −∞ to 6.5 points) in favor of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, which indicated noninferiority of physical therapy to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (p = 0.001). However, the effects at the 12-month period (5.7 points [97.5% CI, −∞ to 9.4 points]) and the 24-month period (4.8 points [97.5% CI, −∞ to 8.5 points]) did not demonstrate noninferiority. The as-treated analysis had similar results. Furthermore, knee pain during weight-bearing favored arthroscopic partial meniscectomy over physical therapy. There was no difference between groups in radiographic osteoarthritis progression. Post hoc exploratory analyses found that patients with increased baseline pain or obesity did better with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy relative to physical therapy. The ESCAPE Research Group thus supported recommendations that physical therapy may be considered an appropriate alternative to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy as first-line therapy. Patella The optimal approach in treating patients with first-time traumatic patellar dislocations is still an active area of research. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing operative and nonoperative treatments of first-time lateral patellar dislocations found that operative treatment is associated with more complications but with better short-term patient-reported outcomes and lower rates of redislocation compared with nonoperative treatment8. No difference in outcomes was found between the groups at a longer-term follow-up. A different systematic review and meta-analysis looking at varying treatments of the medial patellofemoral ligament demonstrated no difference in outcomes or recurrence between operative and nonoperative treatments for patients sustaining a first-time patellar dislocation9. However, for patients with recurrent patellar instability, reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament demonstrated superior results compared with medial soft-tissue realignment techniques such as medial capsule reefing. With numerous fixation techniques on the patella for medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction being described and performed, a number of recent studies have been published investigating the outcomes comparing patella-sided fixation techniques. A recent systematic review found that there may be fewer complications and fractures with cortical fixation devices on the patella in comparison with techniques creating a patellar bone socket10. A prospective trial performed in China11 comparing single-bundle transpatellar tunnel and double-anchor anatomic techniques showed that the double-anchor technique may lead to more congruent patellofemoral contact pressures and less recurrent dislocations. Shoulder Acromioclavicular Joint A number of recent studies have been published evaluating the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of surgery for high-grade acromioclavicular joint injuries using contemporary techniques and implants. A meta-analysis comparing a suture button construct and hook plate fixation for acute unstable acromioclavicular joint dislocations was performed demonstrating improved outcomes and pain scores in patients treated with suture button constructs12. No differences in complications, postoperative coracoclavicular distance, loss of reduction, or operative time was found between the 2 fixation techniques. An RCT with good methodology was performed in the United Kingdom comparing suspension button fixation with nonoperative treatment of patients with acute type-III or IV acromioclavicular joint injuries13. Operative treatment did not result in better outcomes, return to sport, or cost-effectiveness compared with nonoperative treatment at 1 year. There was a relatively high number (16%) of patients who crossed over from nonoperative treatment to operative treatment. No specific patient factors were identified that were associated with risk of failure of nonoperative treatment, and the authors thus recommended that treatment should be individualized on the basis of age, activity level, and preferences. Lastly, a group from Abu Dhabi performed an RCT comparing arthroscopic treatment and open treatment for acute acromioclavicular joint dislocations14. The authors demonstrated that arthroscopic surgery costs more money and is associated with longer operative times with similar outcomes compared with open treatment. Rotator Cuff The efficacy of shoulder arthroscopy for rotator cuff disease continues to be evaluated. A Cochrane Systematic Review of published RCTs comparing subacromial decompression surgery with placebo or nonoperative treatment for shoulder impingement was recently published15. Although 8 RCTs with a total of 1,062 patients were included in the analysis, 2 trials (506 participants) were deemed to have a low risk of bias as they were double-blinded studies and utilized a true placebo group that underwent only an arthroscopy. The other 6 trials were determined to have a high risk of bias because they were not appropriately blinded (as the comparison group was treated nonoperatively, participant blinding was not possible in these studies). All included studies were performed in Europe. Outcomes included mean pain scores, shoulder function, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. The review concluded that high-quality evidence demonstrates that subacromial decompression surgery provides no improvement in pain, shoulder function, or health-related quality of life up to 1 year. Across all studies, the adverse event rate for subacromial decompression surgery was determined to be low (≤3%) and likely did not differ from that for placebo surgery. The main limitation in this study (as is the case with all trials involving arthroscopic sham surgery) was the unknown benefit of arthroscopy itself and the lavage portion of the procedure. Moosmayer et al. published a longer-term follow-up of their prior RCT looking at small to medium-sized rotator cuff tears (≤3 cm) comparing patients randomized to operative repair with those randomized to physiotherapy16. A total of 91 of 103 patients who were initially randomized for the study had 10-year follow-up data (48 patients in the repair group and 43 patients in the physiotherapy group). The Constant score still showed a significant difference of 9.6 points in favor of the surgical repair group, and there was a significantly higher proportion of patients in the repair group (71%) who achieved a good-to-excellent result (Constant score ≥81 points) compared with patients in the physiotherapy group (42%). The patient-reported portion of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and the 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain were also significantly better in the repair group. There was no significant difference in shoulder strength. At 10 years, there were 14 patients who had crossed over from the physiotherapy group and underwent surgery. This represented 27% of the patients in the nonoperative group. The authors found inferior clinical outcomes with a 10-point lower Constant score when comparing this secondary surgery group with the primary repair group. Imaging studies were performed to determine tear progression. In the nonoperative group, tear size progressed in both planes of measurement, with a mean tear size of 10.1 mm in the anterior-posterior plane and 6.3 mm in the medial-lateral plane. The patients with ≥10 mm of tear widening had a lower Constant score by a mean of 14 points compared with patients with <10 mm of tear widening. In the 47 patients who underwent evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of surgically repaired tendons revealed a retear rate of 21% (10 patients) at 1 year, followed by 28% (13 patients) at 5 years and 34% (16 patients) at 10 years (the 5 and 10-year assessments were performed by ultrasound). A comparison of the patients sustaining a retear and those with intact repairs showed a mean difference of 6 points in the Constant score. The authors concluded that outcome differences exist between patients treated with surgical repair and those treated with physiotherapy for small to medium-sized rotator cuff tears that become more clinically relevant with time and thus advocated for the surgical repair of these types of rotator cuff tears in the young and active individual. There are still varying protocols with regard to postoperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair. A multisite RCT investigated the effect of early mobilization compared with standard rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair17. In that study, 206 patients who met inclusion criteria of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear that could be repaired arthroscopically and had undergone 3 months of failed nonoperative therapies were enrolled, with various surgical techniques utilized on the basis of surgeon preference. All study participants were instructed to wear a sling and to begin self-assisted range-of-motion exercises that were demonstrated by a physical therapist. The patients who underwent standard rehabilitation were told to wear the sling at all times except when performing their exercises. The patients in the early mobilization group were told that the sling was only needed for comfort and could be taken off and discontinued at the patient’s discretion and were advised to perform pain-free activities as tolerated but were restricted from lifting objects weighing more than 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg). The early mobilization group showed significantly better forward flexion and abduction at 6 weeks postoperatively, but no subjective or objective differences were found at all other time points, including retear rate as evaluated by ultrasound (30% in the early mobilization group and 33% in the standard rehabilitation group). A similar investigation was performed comparing sling immobilization with no sling postoperatively for patients undergoing rotator cuff repair18. A total of 80 patients who had small to medium-sized, full-thickness superior rotator cuff tears (<3 cm) underwent arthroscopic repair and were randomized to sling immobilization for 4 weeks after surgery compared with no sling at all. The results showed that the patients who were not immobilized had better early range of motion at 6 and 12 weeks but the 2 groups had similar results at 6 months. There was no difference in repair integrity between groups as determined by ultrasound. Labrum and Instability Arthroscopic surgery is generally considered a safe and effective treatment for anterior shoulder instability. However, recurrent instability can persist despite well-performed surgery, and complications other than recurrent dislocation exist. A systematic review of long-term (10-year) follow-up after arthroscopic Bankart repair demonstrated a 78% rate of return to sport, 31% rate of recurrent instability, and 17% overall revision rate19. Most alarmingly, evidence of instability arthropathy was found in 59% of patients in the studies that reported looking for it. It is unknown whether the primary trauma, the surgical procedure, or the subsequent instability episodes are the main cause. A systematic review of complications (other than redislocation) after anterior shoulder stabilization procedures demonstrated a much higher rate of complications in surgical procedures involving bone block transfer compared with procedures involving only soft tissue20. A systematic review of clinical and biomechanical studies of arthroscopic remplissage found that it is a safe and effective procedure21. Three of 4 studies comparing arthroscopic Bankart repair with or without remplissage found significantly higher recurrence rates in the isolated Bankart repair cohorts (20% to 28%) in contrast to shoulders additionally stabilized with remplissage (0% to 5%). Although cadaveric studies have shown significant decreases in external rotation range of motion after remplissage, clinical studies show small decreases (5° to 12°)22. Overall, it appears that the addition of a remplissage procedure is associated with decreased rates of recurrent instability and better patient-reported shoulder function scores compared with isolated Bankart repair alone. Hip Similar to the U.K. FASHIoN (Full randomised controlled trial of Arthroscopic Surgery for Hip Impingement versus best CoNventional) trial published in The Lancet in 201823, an RCT aimed at comparing arthroscopic hip surgery with formal physical therapy and activity modification in patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome was performed24. The authors reported the follow-up data at 8 months after randomization. Seven sites recruited a total of 222 patients (112 who under a surgical procedure and 110 who underwent physical therapy). The cohorts had similar baseline demographic and morphologic data, and all patients had radiographic Kellgren-Lawrence grades of 0 or 1. Complete data for the primary analysis were available for 188 patients (85%); 13 patients in the surgery group did not undergo the surgical procedure during the time period of interest, and 4 patients from the physical therapy group crossed over to the surgery group. At 8 months after randomization, the mean Hip Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living (HOS ADL) scores in the surgery group was 10.0 points higher than the physical therapy group (p = 0.001). The HOS ADL scores were higher than baseline scores in 70% of surgical patients compared with 50% of the physical therapy patients. The patient acceptable symptomatic state (HOS ADL score, >87 points) was achieved in 48% of patients in the surgery group and 19% of patients in the physical therapy group. Other secondary patient-reported outcome measures were all significantly better in the surgery group than in the physical therapy group, with the surgery group having greater improvement in hip flexion (4.8°; p = 0.03) and less pain with hip flexion (p = 0.01) than the physical therapy group. Ankle Ochen et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on both RCTs and observational studies to compare rerupture rate, complications, and functional outcomes for operative and nonoperative treatments of acute Achilles tendon ruptures25. They performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate rerupture rate as related to early or late full weight-bearing, as well as with or without functional rehabilitation with early range of motion. They included 10 RCTs and 19 observational studies, for a total of 15,862 patients (9,375 operatively treated and 6,487 nonoperatively treated). Both open and minimally invasive surgical procedures were included. The rerupture rate was reported in all 29 studies, with an overall pooled effect demonstrating significant reduction in rerupture rate with operative compared with nonoperative treatment. Although a similar reduction in rerupture rate in favor of operative treatment was seen after both early and late full weight-bearing, no significant differences in rerupture rate were seen between operative and nonoperative treatments in studies that used accelerated functional rehabilitation with early range of motion. The overall pooled complication rate showed an as-expected risk ratio in favor of nonoperative treatment over operative treatment. The overall complication rate was 4.9% after operative treatment (infection as the main complication) compared with 1.6% after nonoperative treatment (deep vein thrombosis as the main complication). A Level-I meta-analysis of 7 RCTs comparing dynamic fixation (suture button) and static fixation (metal screw) of acute syndesmotic injuries was published representing the highest Level of Evidence and sample size on this topic to date26. Functional outcomes, complications, and reoperations were evaluated (planned implant removal was not classified as a reoperation). A total of 168 patients were treated with dynamic fixation and 167 patients were treated with static fixation, and they were followed for 1 to 2 years. The random effects meta-analysis for overall complications revealed a significantly reduced risk (relative risk, 0.55; p = 0.003) among the dynamic fixation group compared with the static fixation group. This was particularly evident for inadequate reduction at the time of final follow-up as well as the clinical diagnosis of recurrent diastasis or instability. Implant breakage or loosening was significantly reduced with the dynamic fixation devices. The overall reoperation rate was similar in the 2 groups (relative risk, 0.64; p = 0.07) but reduced when comparing dynamic fixation with permanent screw static fixation (relative risk, 0.24; p = 0.007). The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was higher for dynamic fixation compared with static fixation at 3, 12, and 24 months, and the VAS was lower for dynamic fixation compared with static fixation at 6 and 12 months. The authors acknowledged limitations of patient and personnel blinding, treatment heterogeneity, small samples, and short follow-up in this analysis. Biologics Studies with rigorous methodology have demonstrated no clear benefit of using platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of tendinopathy. With regard to rotator cuff tendinopathy, a recent double-blinded RCT found that platelet-rich plasma injections within interstitial supraspinatus tears did not improve tendon healing (as seen on magnetic resonance arthrography [MRA]) or patient-reported outcome measures compared with saline solution injections and that platelet-rich plasma injections were associated with more complications27. Eighty-four patients with >6 months of shoulder pain, a positive Jobe test, and MRA showing an isolated interstitial supraspinatus tear were randomized to receive either 2 leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma infiltrations or 2 infiltrations of saline solution, with no formal physical therapy to avoid potential bias. The primary outcome of change in lesion volume on MRA at 6 months after the second infiltration showed no significant difference, despite adequate power. There were no differences in any patient-reported outcome measure at any time point. The platelet-rich plasma group had a higher incidence of adverse effects, which included pain for >48 hours, frozen shoulder, and extension of the lesion to the bursal or articular surface (54% compared with 26%; p = 0.020). Seven patients in the platelet-rich plasma group went on to surgery compared with 2 patients in the control group (p = 0.182). Similarly, a single-blinded trial of platelet-rich plasma compared with saline solution injection for patellar tendinopathy demonstrated no difference in any outcome measure at the 1-year follow-up28. Scott et al. randomized 57 patients into 3 single-injection arms: leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma, leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma, and saline solution, all followed by 6 weeks of supervised rehabilitation. The primary analysis at 12 weeks after intervention (93% follow-up) showed that the majority of patients (58%) experienced improvement in the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Questionnaire, Patellar Tendon (VISA-P) score, with no significant difference among treatments. At a 1-year follow-up of 79% of patients, all outcome measures were the same. There was a trend toward more recipients of platelet-rich plasma experiencing worsening of the condition at 6 weeks compared with recipients of saline solution, and a trend toward fewer patients in the leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma group experiencing significant improvement at 12 weeks. There was higher-than-expected variability in treatment responses, which may indicate that the study was underpowered for its primary outcome. There have been several RCTs comparing platelet-rich plasma with hyaluronic acid for knee osteoarthritis in prior years, but Lin et al. performed a double-blinded RCT also including a saline solution control group29. They randomized 87 knees (53 patients) to 3 weekly injections of leukocyte-poor platelet-"

The Fast-Fix device has undergone design changes to reduce deployment failure since its introduction in 2001. Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and mechanism of intra-operative deployment failure of the 3 rd generation Fast-fix 360™ (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, USA) device. Method Data was prospectively collected for 106 consecutive all-inside meniscal repairs undertaken with the Fast-fix 360™ device. Patient demographics, mechanism of failure, site and type of repair were recorded. Results 20 deployment failures occurred in 423 Fast-fix 360™ deployments, an incidence of 4.72%. Deployment failure occurred in 19 of 109 patients an incidence of 17.43%. Six different failure mechanisms occurred; anchor exiting device without trigger being initiated, anchors not holding in meniscus, both anchors simultaneously exiting device and braided suture failing. The most common failure mechanism was failure of the second anchor not holding in the meniscus. Average cost of device failure was $75 per patient.Conclusion Despite design modification, deployment failure still occurs with similar modes top to the original design."
https://openalex.org/W3013934316,Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury and its Prevention,2020-02-17,2020,article,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of major risks for most athletes. ACL injury can be caused by many risk factors such as anatomic risk factors, biomechanical risk factors and environmental risk factors. In this article, numerical and theoretical analysis are conducted to investigate biomechanical risk factors. An entire three-dimensional finite element knee model was built based on MRI data. Anterior Tibial Translations (ATT) at different knee flexion angles are simulated by finite element models. In the simulations, more attentions are given to material properties of different knee components and their effects on ACL injury. Mechanical response of ACL during sport activities is highly determined by its viscoelastic properties. Unfortunately, viscoelastic properties of two bundles of ACL will change dramatically even with several hours’ physical aging. As a consequence, ACL will experience mechanical ductile to brittle transition due to daily physical aging. Theory of physical aging from polymer science is, for the first time, introduced to understand ACL injury and its prevention. By analogy to physical aging of amorphous polymer materials, we think physical aging of two bundles of ACL will largely increase risk of ACL injury. Besides, physical aging will also build a heterogeneous stress and strain in ACL due to its natural anatomic structure, which is a large risk for athletes. The specific designed prevention programs for ACL injury such as plyometrics, strengthening and other neuromuscular training exercises [1] are believed to erase physical aging of ACL. ACL with less physical aging is less likely to get injured in sport activities. In this article, a virtual physical aging simulation is built to validate current hypothesis. Erasing physical aging of ACL may provide an accurate and quantitative way to prevent ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W3005954272,Real‐time biofeedback integrated into neuromuscular training reduces high‐risk knee biomechanics and increases functional brain connectivity: A preliminary longitudinal investigation,2020-02-13,2020,article,"Abstract Prospective evidence indicates that functional biomechanics and brain connectivity may predispose an athlete to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, revealing novel neural linkages for targeted neuromuscular training interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a real‐time biofeedback system for altering knee biomechanics and brain functional connectivity. Seventeen healthy, young, physically active female athletes completed 6 weeks of augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) utilizing real‐time, interactive visual biofeedback and 13 served as untrained controls. A drop vertical jump and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging were separately completed at pre‐ and posttest time points to assess sensorimotor adaptation. The aNMT group had a significant reduction in peak knee abduction moment (pKAM) compared to controls ( p = .03, d = 0.71). The aNMT group also exhibited a significant increase in functional connectivity between the right supplementary motor area and the left thalamus ( p = .0473 after false discovery rate correction). Greater percent change in pKAM was also related to increased connectivity between the right cerebellum and right thalamus for the aNMT group ( p = .0292 after false discovery rate correction, r 2 = .62). No significant changes were observed for the controls ( p s &gt; .05). Our data provide preliminary evidence of potential neural mechanisms for aNMT‐induced motor adaptations that reduce injury risk. Future research is warranted to understand the role of neuromuscular training alone and how each component of aNMT influences biomechanics and functional connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3012852583,The effect of low back pain and lower limb injury on lumbar multifidus muscle morphology and function in university soccer players,2020-02-12,2020,article,"Abstract Background The lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM) plays a critical role to stabilize the spine. While low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint in soccer players, few studies have examined LMM characteristics in this athletic population and their possible associations with LBP and lower limb injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) investigate LMM characteristics in university soccer players and their potential association with LBP and lower limb injury; 2) examine the relationship between LMM characteristics and body composition measurements; and 3) examine seasonal changes in LMM characteristics. Methods LMM ultrasound assessments were acquired in 27 soccer players (12 females, 15 males) from Concordia University during the preseason and assessments were repeated in 18 players at the end of the season. LMM cross-sectional area (CSA), echo-intensity and thickness at rest and during contraction (e.g. function) were assessed bilaterally in prone and standing positions, at the L5-S1 spinal level. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess the history of LBP and lower limb injury. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to acquire body composition measurements. Results Side-to-side asymmetry of the LMM was significantly greater in males ( p = 0.02). LMM thickness when contracted in the prone position ( p = 0.04) and LMM CSA in standing ( p = 0.02) were also significantly greater on the left side in male players. The LMM % thickness change during contraction in the prone position was significantly greater in players who reported having LBP in the previous 3-months ( p &lt; 0.001). LMM CSA (r = − 0.41, p = 0.01) and echo-intensity ( r = 0.69, p &lt; 0.001) were positively correlated to total % body fat. There was a small decrease in LMM thickness at rest in the prone position over the course of the season ( p = 0.03). Conclusions The greater LMM contraction in players with LBP may be a maladaptive strategy to splint and project the spine. LMM morphology measurements were correlated to body composition. The results provide new insights with regards to LMM morphology and activation in soccer players and their associations with injury and body composition measurements."

Regarding this, the present study aims to identify and analyze the factors affecting the crisis incidence in Iranian stadiums. METHODS: The present interpretive qualitative research was performed based on a grounded theory method and latent content analysis technique. The data were collected by the implementation of in-depth interviews with 19 people consisting of the Ministry of Sports and Youth experts and executives, sports management professors, and crisis management specialists. The participants were selected using non-probability and snowball sampling techniques. The interviews were continued until reaching theoretical saturation regarding the research questions and objectives. The gathered data, in form of audio recording and text, were analyzed by MAXQDA software (version 18). FINDINGS: The interview data were analyzed based on open and process coding. Afterward, the researcher categorized the identified factors into causal, contextual, and intervening conditions. In this regard, the causal factors consisted of the following items: 1) nature of crisis, 2) technical and specialized factors, 3) infrastructure and equipment, and 4) environmental and equipment hazards. With respect to the contextual factors, they included: 1) human resources, 2) nature of sporting events, 3) security factors, 4) vandalism, 5) welfare facilities, and 5) management factors. Finally, the intervening factors were found to entail: 1) stadium atmosphere, 2) political and social crises, and 3) information and communications technology. CONCLUSION: According to the obtained results, the officials are recommended to consider the paradigmatic model of factors leading to crisis management in stadiums in the crisis management programs adopted for sports venues, especially large stadiums. The consideration of the factors constituting the given model can lead to the improvement of crisis management in the countrychr('39')s sports venues."
https://openalex.org/W3012760824,Development of a Human Activity Recognition System for Ballet Tasks,2020-02-07,2020,article,"Abstract Background Accurate and detailed measurement of a dancer’s training volume is a key requirement to understanding the relationship between a dancer’s pain and training volume. Currently, no system capable of quantifying a dancer’s training volume, with respect to specific movement activities, exists. The application of machine learning models to wearable sensor data for human activity recognition in sport has previously been applied to cricket, tennis and rugby. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a human activity recognition system using wearable sensor data to accurately identify key ballet movements (jumping and lifting the leg). Our primary objective was to determine if machine learning can accurately identify key ballet movements during dance training. The secondary objective was to determine the influence of the location and number of sensors on accuracy. Results Convolutional neural networks were applied to develop two models for every combination of six sensors (6, 5, 4, 3, etc.) with and without the inclusion of transition movements. At the first level of classification, including data from all sensors, without transitions, the model performed with 97.8% accuracy. The degree of accuracy reduced at the second (83.0%) and third (75.1%) levels of classification. The degree of accuracy reduced with inclusion of transitions, reduction in the number of sensors and various sensor combinations. Conclusion The models developed were robust enough to identify jumping and leg lifting tasks in real-world exposures in dancers. The system provides a novel method for measuring dancer training volume through quantification of specific movement tasks. Such a system can be used to further understand the relationship between dancers’ pain and training volume and for athlete monitoring systems. Further, this provides a proof of concept which can be easily translated to other lower limb dominant sporting activities"

Univariate and multivariate regression models were developed to identify associated factors for specific injury locations and diagnoses.The majority of patients were female (56%). Three most frequently observed malalignments included varus knee alignment, pelvic obliquity, and patellar squinting. The most common injuries were the patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), the iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS), patellar tendinopathy, spinal overload, and ankle instability. A number of contributing factors were identified. Previous injury history was a contributing factor for knee injuries and ITBFS. Lower training load was reported with a higher incidence of PFPS, while a higher training load was positively associated with injuries of the lower leg. Runners with a higher body mass index (BMI) were at a significantly higher risk for lower back injuries.Running-related injuries are multifactorial associated with a combination of variables including personal data, training load, anatomic malalignments, and injury history. They can furthermore result from a lack of experience/training as well as from overuse. Suffering a specific RRI of high risk could be defined based on individual predispositions and help to induce appropriate training balance."

Methods: Twelve soccer players performed 120 min of soccer-specific exercise. Tri-axial (PLTotal) and uni-axial PlayerLoad™ in the vertical (PLV), anterior–posterior (PLA–P), and medial–lateral (PLM–L) planes were monitored using a portable accelerometer. Likewise, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was recorded throughout exercise. At the end of each 15-min period, players provided differential ratings of perceived exertion for legs (RPE-L), breathlessness (RPE-B) and overall (RPE-O), and capillary samples were taken to measure blood lactate (BLa) concentrations. The soccer-specific exercise was completed twice within 7 days to assess reliability. Results: A main effect for time was identified for PLTotal (p = 0.045), PLV (p = 0.002), PLA–P (p = 0.011), RER (p = 0.001), RPE-L (p = 0.001), RPE-O (p = 0.003), and CMJ (p = 0.020). A significant increase in PLTotal (234 ± 34 au) and decrease in RER (0.87 ± 0.03) was evident during 105–120 versus 0–15 min (215 ± 25 au; p = 0.002 and 0.92 ± 0.02; p = 0.001). Coefficients of variations were <10% and Pearson's correlation coefficient demonstrated moderate-to-very strong (0.33–0.99) reliability for all PL variables, RPE-B, BLa, and RER. Conclusions: These results suggest that mechanical efficiency is compromised and an increased rate of lipolysis is observed as a function of exercise duration, particularly during ET. These data have implications for practitioners interested in fatigue-induced changes during ET."

The study involved 36 individual (sprint, hurdles, jumping, tennis, and judo) and 34 team (soccer, basketball, and handball) athletes. CODS and RA were measured with a light-based reactive training system in a frontal (FR), universal (UN), semicircular (SC), and lateral (LA) design. Lower limb power and sprint performance were also measured in a 10 m single leg jump test and 15 m sprint. Individual athletes showed significantly better performance in three of the eight agility tests: LA-RA, UN-RA, and SC-CODS (p < 0.008, p < 0.036, and p < 0.027, respectively) and were found to present stronger correlations (p < 0.01) between jump test performance and the CODS condition. Team athletes showed stronger associations between sprint performance and the CODS condition. In the RA condition both jump and sprint performance showed stronger correlations in the group of individual athletes. Agility performance as measured by CODS and RA should improve with enhanced of motor proficiency. Finally, the tests applied in this experiment seem to be multidimensional, but require spatio-temporal adjustment for their implementation, so that they meet the requirements of the particular sport."

Because there is no available injury prevention training specifically developed for youth handball players targeting both upper and lower limbs or incorporating psychological aspects of injury, we undertook the ‘Implementing injury Prevention training ROutines in TEams and Clubs in youth Team handball (I-PROTECT)’ project. We used an ecological participatory design incorporating the perspectives of multiple stakeholders (health beneficiaries, programme deliverers and policy makers). The aim of this paper was to describe the process of developing the I-PROTECT model, featuring injury prevention training and an accompanying implementation strategy. Design We used the generalisable six-step intervention development process, outlined to guide researchers when developing implementable, evidence-based sports injury prevention interventions, to develop the I-PROTECT model. The six-step process involves establishing a research–stakeholder collaborative partnership to (1) identify and synthesise research evidence and clinical experience; (2) consult with relevant experts; (3) engage end users to ensure their needs, capacity and values are considered; (4) test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention; (5) evaluate the intervention against theory; and (6) obtain feedback from early implementers. Two community handball clubs in southern Sweden, offering organised training for youth male and female players, and the district handball federation, participate in the intervention development. Drafts of the I-PROTECT model will be developed and revised with key stakeholder advice and input throughout all six steps. Conclusion The I-PROTECT model described will be an end user-driven intervention, including evidence-based, theory-informed and context-specific injury prevention training for youth handball, and an associated implementation strategy."

Material and Methods: Participants in the cross-sectional study were 441 university students aged between 18 and 34 years old (M = 22.09, SD = 2.19), including 60.09% of men, at a large university in the south of Poland. The NEO-FFI questionnaire was used to assess Big-Five personality traits. Results: One-way ANOVA revealed that TSP sample scored significantly lower in neuroticism, openness and agreeableness than both PES and OFS groups. TSP also demonstrated higher scores in extraversion, in comparison to PES. The PES and OFS did not differ one another in personality traits. Conscientiousness was at the same level in all three groups. Conclusions: Increasing achievement motivation and compliance with norms may heighten conscientiousness among undergraduates. The information about personality should be used by the coach to team conflict reduction, to make an appropriate selection decision and to develop individual development plans for particular team members."

With recent advances in gait analysis, clinical assessment of such a knee-related condition has been improved. Although motion capture (mocap) technology is deemed the gold standard for gait analysis, it heavily relies on adequate data processing to yield clinically significant results. Moreover, gait data is non-linear and high-dimensional. Due to missing data involved in a mocap session and typical statistical assumptions, conventional data processing methods are unable to reveal the intrinsic patterns to predict gait abnormalities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Albeit studies have demonstrated the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to address these limitations, these algorithms have not gained wide acceptance amongst biomechanists. The most common AI algorithms used in gait analysis are based on machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANN). By comparing the predictive capability of such algorithms from published studies, we assessed their potential to augment current clinical gait diagnostics when dealing with knee OA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, an evidence-based review and analysis were conducted. With over 188 studies identified, 8 studies met the inclusion criteria for a subsequent analysis, accounting for 78 participants overall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The classification performance of ML and ANN algorithms was quantitatively assessed. The test classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and area under the curve (AUC) of the ML-based algorithms were clinically valuable, i.e., all higher than 85%, differently from those obtained via ANN. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the potential of ML for clinical assessment of knee disorders in an accurate and reliable manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;"

For instance, using NeuroFeedback (NF), athletes can learn to self-regulate specific brain rhythms and consequently improve their performances. Here, we focused on soccer goalkeepers’ Covert Visual Spatial Attention (CVSA) abilities, which are essential for these athletes to reach high performances. We looked for Electroencephalography (EEG) markers of CVSA usable for virtual reality-based NF training procedures, i.e., markers that comply with the following criteria: (1) specific to CVSA, (2) detectable in real-time and (3) related to goalkeepers’ performance/expertise. Our results revealed that the best-known EEG marker of CVSA—increased α -power ipsilateral to the attended hemi-field— was not usable since it did not comply with criteria 2 and 3. Nonetheless, we highlighted a significant positive correlation between athletes’ improvement in CVSA abilities and the increase of their α -power at rest. While the specificity of this marker remains to be demonstrated, it complied with both criteria 2 and 3. This result suggests that it may be possible to design innovative ecological training procedures for goalkeepers, for instance using a combination of NF and cognitive tasks performed in virtual reality."

An open forum as announced in the conference advertising was held at the Annual Meeting of the New England Regional Chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine (NEACSM) November 7 to 8, 2019, in Providence, Rhode Island, USA for attending NEACSM members to voice their input on the process. Herein, we report the proceedings. The round table participants perceived the quality assurance standard to be important, but identified some practical process challenges that included the broad scope and complexity of the device universe, the need for a multiphase testing pathway, and the associated fees for product evaluation. The participants also supported the evaluation of device data analysis, behavioral influences, and user experience in the overall evaluation. Looking forward, the FIMS quality assurance standard faces the challenge of balancing these broader perspectives with practical constraints of budget, facilities, time, and human resources."
https://openalex.org/W3008931937,Plaster cast versus functional bracing for Achilles tendon rupture: the UKSTAR RCT,2020-02-01,2020,article,"Background Achilles tendon rupture affects &gt; 11,000 people each year in the UK, leading to prolonged periods away from work, sports and social activities. Traditionally, the ruptured tendon is held still in a plaster cast for ≥ 8 weeks. Functional bracing is an alternative treatment that allows patients to mobilise earlier, but there is little evidence about how bracing affects patients’ recovery. Objectives To measure the Achilles Tendon Rupture Score, quality of life, complications and resource use of patients receiving non-operative treatment for an Achilles tendon rupture treated with plaster cast compared with those treated with functional bracing. Design This was a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic, two-group superiority trial. Setting The setting was 39 NHS hospitals. Participants A total of 540 adult patients treated non-operatively for Achilles tendon rupture were randomised from July 2016 to May 2018. Exclusion criteria included presenting after 14 days, having had previous rupture and being unable to complete questionnaires. Interventions A total of 266 participants had a plaster cast applied, with their toes initially pointing to the floor. The cast was changed over 8 weeks to bring the foot into a walking position. A total of 274 patients had a functional brace that facilitated immediate weight-bearing. The foot position was adjusted within the brace over the same 8-week period. Main outcome measures Achilles Tendon Rupture Score is patient reported and assesses symptoms and physical activity related to the Achilles tendon (score 0–100, with 100 being the best possible outcome). The secondary outcomes were quality of life, complications and resource use at 8 weeks and at 3, 6 and 9 months. Results Participants had a mean age of 48.7 years, were predominantly male (79%) and had ruptured their tendon during sports (70%). Over 93% of participants completed follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in Achilles Tendon Rupture Score at 9 months post injury (–1.38, 95% confidence interval –4.9 to 2.1). There was a statistically significant difference in Achilles Tendon Rupture Score at 8 weeks post injury in favour of the functional brace group (5.53, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 9.1), but not at 3 or 6 months post injury. Quality of life showed the same pattern, with a statistically significant difference at 8 weeks post injury but not at later time points. Complication profiles were similar in both groups. Re-rupture of the tendon occurred 17 times in the plaster cast group and 13 times in the functional brace group. There was no difference in resource use. Conclusions This trial provides strong evidence that early weight-bearing in a functional brace provides similar outcomes to traditional plaster casting and is safe for patients receiving non-operative treatment of Achilles tendon rupture. The probability that functional bracing is cost-effective exceeds 95% for the base-case imputed analysis, assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. On average, functional brace is associated with lower costs (–£103, 95% confidence interval –£290 to £84) and more quality-adjusted life-years (0.015, 95% confidence interval –0.0013 to 0.030) than plaster cast. Limitations Some patients declined to participate in the trial, but only a small proportion of these declined because they had a preference for one treatment or another. Overall, 58% of eligible patients agreed to participate, so the participants are broadly representative of the population under investigation. Future work Although the UK Study of Tendo Achilles Rehabilitation provides guidance with regard to early management, rehabilitation following Achilles tendon rupture is prolonged and further research is required to define the optimal mode of rehabilitation after the initial cast/brace has been removed.

Little is known about the nature of head contact in the sport, which is necessary to inform the extent to which protective headgear is warranted. The objective of this study was to identify the location, types and frequency of head and body contacts in competitive 7v7 non-tackle American football.Video analysis was used to document the type, frequency and mechanism of contacts across a series of under 12, under 14 and high school non-tackle tournament games. A subset of impacts was quantitatively analysed via 3-D model-based image matching to calculate the preimpact and postimpact speed of players' heads and the change in resultant translational and rotational velocities.The incidence rate of head contact was found to be low (3.5 contacts per 1000 athlete-plays). Seventy-five per cent of head contacts were caused by a head-to-ground impact. No head-to-head contacts were identified. Most contacts occurred to the rear upper (occiput) or side upper (temporal/parietal) regions. Head-to-ground impact was associated with a maximum preimpact velocity of 5.9±2.2 m/s and a change in velocity of 3.0±1.1 m/s.Non-tackle football appears to represent a lower contact alternative to tackle football. The distribution of head impact locations, mechanisms and energies found in the present study is different than what has been previously reported for tackle football. The existing tackle football standards are not appropriate to be applied to the sport of non-tackle football, and sport-specific head protection and headgear certification standards must be determined."

A sample of 35 football players with CP from three different countries took part in the study. They performed four tests in two sessions 72 h apart: i) 20 m in a straight line, ii) forward slalom with short changes of direction, iii) forward slalom with wide changes of direction and iv) square course. The Kappa coefficient was used to test content validity, obtaining moderate to almost perfect agreement results. Construct validity was also demonstrated with very large to almost perfect correlations between tests and sessions. Good reliability was found using intra-class coefficients (&gt;0.86), standard error of measurement (&lt;10.8%) and Cronbach´s alpha (&gt;0.86). The comparisons between CP profiles (i.e. sport classes) demonstrated that those with mild impairment performed faster, and those with impairment of ataxia and dyskinesia performed worse. The four tests could have applications in classification, but may also be applied by the CP football coaches to improve athlete agility and football skills."

The purpose of this investigation was to determine how leg stiffness of runners was influenced in the 24 and 48 hour period following a cross country race. Twenty-two collegiate cross-country runners (13 males, 9 females, 19.5 ± 1.4 yr) were recruited and participated in the study. Leg stiffness was assessed 24 hours before and after a race as well as 48 hours post-race. Three jumping protocols were conducted: 1) a static jump, 2) a countermovement jump, and 3) a vertical hopping test. Two embedded force plates (1000 Hz) were utilized to measure ground reaction forces for each test and a metronome was utilized to maintain hopping frequency (2.2 Hz). A significant main effect was found for a static jump, a countermovement jump and leg stiffness. Leg stiffness was significantly reduced 24 hours post-race (pre-race 36.84 kN·m -1 , 24h post 33.11 kN·m -1 , p &lt; 0.05), but not 48 hours post-race (36.30 kN·m -1 ). No significant differences were found in post-hoc analysis for the squat jump, countermovement jump height and the eccentric utilization ratio. Following a cross-country race, leg stiffness significantly declined in a group of collegiate runners in the immediate 24 hours post-race, but returned to baseline 48 hours post-race. Sport scientists and running coaches may be able to monitor leg stiffness as a metric to properly prescribe training regiments."
https://openalex.org/W3003815890,The ‘DEEP’ Landing Error Scoring System,2020-01-29,2020,article,"The Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) is an injury-risk screening tool used in sports; but scoring is time consuming, clinician-dependent, and generally inaccessible outside of elite sports. Our aim is to evidence that LESS scores can be automated using deep-learning-based computer vision combined with machine learning and compare the accuracy of LESS predictions using different video cropping and machine learning methods. Two-dimensional videos from 320 double-leg drop-jump landings with known LESS scores were analysed in OpenPose. Videos were cropped to key frames manually (clinician) and automatically (computer vision), and 42 kinematic features were extracted. A series of 10 × 10-fold cross-validation experiments were applied on full and balanced datasets to predict LESS scores. Random forest for regression outperformed linear and dummy regression models, yielding the lowest mean absolute error (1.23) and highest correlation (r = 0.63) between manual and automated scores. Sensitivity (0.82) and specificity (0.77) were reasonable for risk categorization (high-risk LESS ≥ 5 errors). Experiments using either a balanced (versus unbalanced) dataset or manual (versus automated) cropping method did not improve predictions. Further research on the automation would enhance the strength of the agreement between clinical and automated scores beyond its current levels, enabling quasi real-time scoring."
https://openalex.org/W3005287855,A novel repetitive head impact exposure measurement tool differentiates player position in National Football League,2020-01-28,2020,article,"Abstract American-style football participation poses a high risk of repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure leading to acute and chronic brain injury. The complex nature of symptom expression, human predisposition, and neurological consequences of RHI limits our understanding of what constitutes as an injurious impact affecting the integrity of brain tissue. Video footage of professional football games was reviewed and documentation made of all head contact. Frequency of impact, tissue strain magnitude, and time interval between impacts was used to quantify RHI exposure, specific to player field position. Differences in exposure characteristics were found between eight different positions; where three unique profiles can be observed. Exposure profiles provide interpretation of the relationship between the traumatic event(s) and how tissue injury is manifested and expressed. This study illustrates and captures an objective measurement of RHI on the field, a critical component in guiding public policy and guidelines for managing exposure."

It has been found that ACTN3 XX individuals have several traits related to lessened muscle performance. This study aimed to determine the influence, if any, of ACTN3 genotypes on injury incidence of marathoners during the year preceding to participating in a competitive marathon race. Using a cross-sectional experimental design, the type and conditions of sports injuries were documented for one year in a group of 139 marathoners. Injuries were recorded following a consensus statement on injuries in Athletics. Afterward, ACTN3 genotyping was performed, and injury epidemiology was compared among RR, RX, and XX genotypes. The distribution of the RR/RX/XX genotypes was 28.8/42.8/23.5%, respectively. A total of 67 injuries were recorded. The frequency of marathoners that reported any injury during the previous year was not different across the genotypes (55.0/38.8/40.6%, P = 0.241). Although the overall injury incidence was not different among genotypes (2.78/1.65/1.94 injuries/1000 h of running, P = 0.084), the likelihood of suffering an injury was higher in RR than in RX (OR = 1.93: 95%CI = 0.87–4.30), and higher than in XX (OR = 1.79: 0.70–4.58). There was no difference in the conditions, severity, body location, time of year, or leading cause of injury among genotypes. However, XX presented a higher frequency of sudden-onset injuries (P = 0.024), and the OR for muscle-type injuries was 2.0 (0.51–7.79) times higher compared to RR runners. Although XX marathoners did not have a higher overall incidence of injury, the OR in these runners for muscle-type injuries was superior to RR and RX runners. The likelihood of suffering a muscle injury, especially with a sudden-onset, was twice in XX than in RR endurance runners."

NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four court-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Strap. Ground contact time, peak eccentric rate of force development (RFD), peak concentric GRF, peak concentric COM power, eccentric work, concentric work, and movement completion time were measured. Tri Strap saw improvements in four of seven biomechanical variables during CMJ and LSJ and one variable during TDS. Lace Replacement delivered improvements in one performance measure during CMJ, LSJ, and AP, and two variables in TDS. Y Wrap improved performance in three performance measures during LSJ and impaired performance in two measures during CMJ and three measures during AP. Tri Strap provided the most consistent performance improvements across all movements. This study allowed for the mechanical properties of the shoe lower to remain consistent across designs to examine if an alternative shoe upper closure could enhance performance. Our results indicate that increased proprioception and/or mechanical properties due to the alternative closures, especially Tri Strap, improves athlete performance, which concludes that the design of the shoe upper is an essential consideration in shoe design."

A total of 66 (36 RFS, 30 NRFS) healthy amateur male runners were included in our study. In-shoe pressure sensors were utilised to the test plantar loads when participants were running using their preferred foot strike pattern and running speed (RFS: 3.2 ± 0.3 m/s; NRFS: 3.4 ± 0.4 m/s). Results indicated that running speed has a significant effect on the total contact area [F (1, 64) = 7.061, P = 0.01, η 2 = 0.101], which also affects midfoot and forefoot regions. No significant difference was found on the total maximum force, force-time-integral, peak pressure (PP) and pressure-time-integral (PTI), but the total contact area of RFS was higher than that of NRFS runners [F (1, 64) = 77.406, P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.551]. Plantar loads were mainly focused on the heel and midfoot for RFS runners in all variables, and NRFS runners experienced increased PP and PTI in medial forefoot regions. Habitual runners tend to adjust their contact area according to the running speed through midfoot and forefoot regions. RFS runners remain susceptible to high impact force on the heel and midfoot, and NRFS runners experience high impact force in the first metatarsal regions. Therefore, runners should note this situation to avoid running-related injuries."

Physical and Physiological Responses on Semi-Professional Soccer Players,2020-01-24,2020,article,"Background: Decision-making in soccer has repercussions and depends on the environment of training or competition. The demands on the players can reveal if the decision-making is similar or different from that required during competition. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the physical and physiological responses of players in training matches (TM) and official competition matches (CM) according to the playing position (external defenders, internal defenders, midfielders, and forwards/extremes). Methods: Twenty semi-professional male soccer players and 10 CM (n = 40) and 10 TM (n = 40) were studied using global positioning system technology, and paired and one-way ANOVA tests were carried out to compare physical (distances and number of sprints) and physiological (heart rates) responses with the factors a) match environments (TM and CM) and b) the playing position, respectively. Results: The results revealed that during CM, players covered higher total distance, partial distances, and sprints at different speeds (0–21 km/h) and produced higher physiological responses. Midfielders covered the greatest total distance in both TM (7227.6 m) and CM (11,225.9 m), in comparison to the other playing positions. However, forwards and extremes spent more time (56.8% of the CM [d = 0.78]) at 76% to 84% of their maximal heart rates. Conclusions: First, the physical and physiological responses in TM were significantly lower than in CM. Second, these responses were different according to the playing position, so this study was able to verify the exact amount of variation between the load produced in TM and CM. These results will help the coach and technical staff to design training tasks to complement the responses found in TM."

Explicit learning is a more conscious approach to learning, in which many detailed instructions about the movement are provided to the learner. Implicit learning strives to take place in a more automatic manner, without much knowledge of the underlying facts and rules of the movement. Objective To evaluate whether the implicit and explicit motor learning walking interventions for people after stroke delivered in a randomized controlled trial were performed as intended (fidelity) and to report the therapist and participant experiences with regard to feasibility. Methods Fidelity was assessed by evaluating the dose delivered (number of therapy sessions) and content of instructions (explicit rules) that were collected through the therapist logs and audio recordings of the training sessions. The therapist and participant experiences were assessed by means of self-developed questionnaires. Results 79 people were included of which seven people (9%) dropped out. The remaining participants all received the required minimum of seven sessions. Overall therapists adhered to the intervention guideline. On average 5.2 and 0.4 explicit rules were used within the explicit and implicit group respectively. Therapists and participants were generally positive about the feasibility but frequent comments were made by the therapists regarding “therapy time restrictions” and “tendency of the participants to develop explicit rules”. Conclusion Delivery of the implicit and explicit motor learning walking interventions were successful in terms of fidelity. Therapists and participants were generally positive about the feasibility of the intervention."

Methods: This study included 27 participants with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis. Cross-sectional area of hip muscles, including psoas major, rectus femoris, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and minimus, adductor longus and magnus, obturator internus, and obturator externus, were measured from magnetic resonance images. Hip pain and function were evaluated using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). Results: After adjusting for age and gender, greater cross-sectional area of adductor longus and magnus was associated with a higher HOOS score in quality of life (regression coefficient 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-2.7, p=0.02), activity of daily living (regression coefficient 1.3, 95% CI 0.1-2.6, p=0.04) and sport and recreation function (regression coefficient 1.6, 95% CI 0.1-3.0, p=0.04). Greater cross-sectional area of psoas major was associated with a higher quality of life score (regression coefficient 3.6, 95% CI -0.5 to 7.7, p=0.08). The cross-sectional area of hip muscles was not significantly associated with HOOS pain or symptom score. Conclusion: Greater cross-sectional area of hip adductors was associated with better function and quality of life in individuals with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis. Greater cross-sectional area of hip flexors might be associated with better quality of life. These findings, while need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies, suggest that targeting the hip adductor and flexor muscles may improve function and quality of life in those with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis."

The study examined 37 soccer players aged 19 to 30 years (body mass: 76.8 ± 7.2 kg, body height 1.82 ± 0.06 m). Muscle torques of the knee joint were measured under isometric conditions using a Biodex 4 Pro dynamometer. The anthropometric variables such as body part lengths, breadths, and girths and skinfold thickness were measured. The strongest relationships of knee joint extensors were observed with body mass and variables describing skeleton size and lower-limb muscles. Regarding knee flexor torque, a significant relationship was found only with body mass. However, no significant relationships were observed between the conventional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio and the anthropometric variables studied. The regression analysis results identified body height, body mass, and thigh and calf girth as the features most associated with knee joint torque. However, anthropometric measurements do not provide full information about the torque proportions of antagonist muscle groups, which is very important for injury prevention. Therefore, measurements using special biomechanical equipment are also necessary for the comprehensive analyses and control of the effects of sports training."

To better understand rTBI, we introduced a new model of rTBI in mice induced by sudden rotation in the coronal plane combined with lateral translation delivered twice at interval of 24-h. By routine histology, histological examination of Prussian blue stained sections revealed the presence of microbleed in the corpus callosum and brain stem. Amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and neurofilament heavy-chain (NF-200) immunohistochemistry demonstrated axonal injury following rTBI. Swelling, waving, and enlargement axons were observed in the corpus callosum and brain stem 24-h after injury by Bielshowsky staining. Ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy provided further insights into the existence and progression of axonal injury. rTBI led to widespread astrogliosis and microgliosis in white matter, as well as significantly increased levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. rTBI mice showed a significantly increased loss of righting reflex (LRR) duration within each time point compared to that of sham animals, which was under 15 min. rTBI mice exhibited depression-like behavior at 1 month. rTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. These results suggested that this model might be suitable for investigating rTBI pathophysiology and evaluating preclinical candidate therapeutics."

This complicates the work of clinicians and researchers. The International Hip-related Pain Research Network consensus group met in November 2018 in Zurich aiming to make recommendations on how to classify, define and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Prior to the meeting we performed a scoping review of electronic databases in June 2018 to determine the definition, epidemiology and diagnosis of hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain. We developed and presented evidence-based statements for these to a panel of 37 experts for discussion and consensus agreement. Both non-musculoskeletal and serious hip pathological conditions (eg, tumours, infections, stress fractures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), as well as competing musculoskeletal conditions (eg, lumbar spine) should be excluded when diagnosing hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults. The most common hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without a distinct osseous morphology (labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions), and that these terms are used in research and clinical practice. Clinical examination and diagnostic imaging have limited diagnostic utility; a comprehensive approach is therefore essential. A negative flexion-adduction-internal rotation test helps rule out hip-related pain although its clinical utility is limited. Anteroposterior pelvis and lateral femoral head-neck radiographs are the initial diagnostic imaging of choice-advanced imaging should be performed only when requiring additional detail of bony or soft-tissue morphology (eg, for definitive diagnosis, research setting or when planning surgery). We recommend clear, detailed and consistent methodology of bony morphology outcome measures (definition, measurement and statistical reporting) in research. Future research on conditions with hip-related pain as the main symptom should include high-quality prospective studies on aetiology and prognosis. The most common hip conditions in active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) FAI syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without distinct osseous morphology including labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions. The last category should not be confused with the incidental imaging findings of labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres pathology in asymptomatic people. Future research should refine our current recommendations by determining the clinical utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W3000777044,Human athletic paleobiology; using sport as a model to investigate human evolutionary adaptation,2020-01-20,2020,review,"Abstract The use of sport as a conceptual framework offers unprecedented opportunities to improve our understanding of what the body does, shedding new light on our evolutionary trajectory, our capacity for adaptation, and the underlying biological mechanisms. This approach has gained traction over recent years. To date, sport has facilitated exploration not only of the evolutionary history of our species as a whole, but also of human variation and adaptation at the interindividual and intraindividual levels. At the species level, analysis of lower and upper limb biomechanics and energetics with respect to walking, running and throwing have led to significant advances in the understanding of human adaptations relative to other hominins. From an interindividual perspective, investigation of physical activity patterns and endurance running performance is affording greater understanding of evolved constraints of energy expenditure, thermoregulatory energetics, signaling theory, and morphological variation. Furthermore, ultra‐endurance challenges provoke functional trade‐offs, allowing new ground to be broken in the study of life history trade‐offs and human adaptability. Human athletic paleobiology—the recruitment of athletes as study participants and the use of contemporary sports as a model for studying evolutionary theory—has great potential. Here, we draw from examples in the literature to provide a review of how the use of athletes as a model system is enhancing understanding of human evolutionary adaptation."

Design Prognosis systematic review (PROSPERO registration number CRD42016036788). Methods We searched Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro and Google Scholar from inception to 3rd May 2018. Eligible articles included patients with ACL injury (diagnosis confirmed by MRI and/or diagnostic arthroscopy), reported the number of meniscal tears at the time of ACL injury diagnosis/start of treatment and reported the number of new meniscal tears that subsequently occurred. Articles with fewer than 20 patients at follow-up, and articles limited to ACL revision surgery or multi-ligament knee injuries were excluded. Two independent reviewers screened articles, assessed eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We judged the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group methodology. Results Of 75 studies included in the systematic review, 54 studies with 9624 patients and 501 new meniscal tears were appropriate for quantitative analysis. Heterogeneity precluded data pooling. The risk of new meniscal tears was 0%–21% when follow-up was &lt;2 years, 0%–29% when follow-up was 2 to 5 years, 5%–52% when follow-up was 5 to 10 years and 4%–31% when follow-up was longer than 10 years. The proportion of studies with high risk of selection, misclassification and detection bias was 84%, 69% and 68%, respectively. Certainty of evidence was very low. Conclusion New meniscal tears occurred in 0%–52% of patients between 4 months and 20 years (mean 4.9±4.4 years) following treatment for ACL injury. The certainty of evidence was too low to guide surgical treatment decisions. This review cannot conclude that the incidence of new meniscal tears is lower if ACL injury is treated with surgery compared with treatment with rehabilitation only."

A number of different implant options are available for the management of this injury. Two-device procedures were suggested because of the higher rate of malunion by single-device treatment. However, surgical treatment using a cephalomedullary nail is still an alternative option that provides better mechanical advantage and minimal invasion. This study details the technique of treating these pattern fractures with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation II (PFNA-II) to achieve an acceptable reduction in both fracture sites.Ten cases of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures under reduction by PFNA II were included and reviewed. A saw-bone model was also utilized to perform the detailed technique of reduction and fixation of PFNA II.Under the special technique by using the PFNA II, all ten cases achieved optimal reduction and alignment of both fracture sites in intra-operative fluoroscopy. There was no intra-operative complication noted. After 6 months of follow-up, radiography revealed proper alignment and well union of the fractures.Fixation of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures with a single construct provides advantages of good biomechanical function, minimal invasion, reduced blood loss, and less operation time when comparing to two-device fixation. Thus, if acceptable reduction could be achieved, fixation by one PFNA II was a good alternative choice for this injury pattern."
https://openalex.org/W3000399561,Mild Hyperthermia Aggravates Glucose Metabolic Consequences in Repetitive Concussion,2020-01-17,2020,article,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability around the world. Mild TBI (mTBI) makes up approximately 80% of reported cases and often results in transient psychological abnormalities and cognitive disruption. At-risk populations for mTBI include athletes and other active individuals who may sustain repetitive concussive injury during periods of exercise and exertion when core temperatures are elevated. Previous studies have emphasized the impact that increased brain temperature has on adverse neurological outcomes. A lack of diagnostic tools to assess concussive mTBI limits the ability to effectively identify the post-concussive period during which the brain is uniquely susceptible to damage upon sustaining additional injury. Studies have suggested that a temporal window of increased vulnerability that exists corresponds to a period of injury-induced depression of cerebral glucose metabolism. In the current study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between repetitive concussion, local cerebral glucose metabolism, and brain temperature using the Marmarou weight drop model to generate mTBI. Animals were injured three consecutive times over a period of 7 days while exposed to either normothermic or hyperthermic temperatures for 15 min prior to and 1 h post each injury. A 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) autoradiography was used to measure local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (lCMRGlc) in 10 diverse brain regions across nine bregma levels 8 days after the initial insult. We found that repetitive mTBI significantly decreased glucose utilization bilaterally in several cortical areas, such as the cingulate, visual, motor, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in subcortical areas, including the caudate putamen and striatum, compared to sham control animals. lCMRGlc was significant in both normothermic and hyperthermic repetitive mTBI animals relative to the sham group, but to a greater degree when exposed to hyperthermic conditions. Taken together, we report significant injury-induced glucose hypometabolism after repetitive concussion in the brain, and additionally highlight the importance of temperature management in the acute period after brain injury."

Though there are protocols set in place for assessments of PCEs, there has been no evidence of adherence in major football tournaments.Our research goal is to determine if PCEs in elite football are professionally assessed according to the International Conference on Concussion in Sport (ICCS) consensus statement recommendations. Identification and analysis of PCEs in the 2018 World Cup (WC) were accomplished through standardised observation of video footage by trained observers. Results were contrasted with data from the 2014 WC and 2016 Euro Cup. Our primary outcomes include frequency and professional assessment of PCEs, signs of concussions and time stopped for assessments.In the 64 games of the 2018 WC, 87 PCEs (1.36 per game) were identified. Thirty-one (35.6%) PCEs were professionally assessed, resulting in the removal of three (3.5%) players from the match. Six (6.9%) PCEs showed one sign of concussion, 60 (69.0%) showed two signs, 20 (23.0%) showed three signs and 1 (1.2%) showed four or more signs. The mean time stopped for assessment was 63.3 s. No significant change in the percentage of professional assessments (mean=33.4%, 95% CI 20.7% to 46.1%) were identified across tournaments (p=0.42).These findings demonstrate a need for adherence to concussion protocols in order to improve the brain-health of athletes. Proper enforcement of the ICCS protocols during these tournaments and promoting player health and safety can influence the officiating, coaching and playing of football worldwide by promoting player safety."

When patients with JIA have persistent pain or mechanical symptoms despite treatment of their inflammation, other causes must be considered. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a focal alteration of subchondral bone formation that causes softening of the overlying cartilage, which can progress to instability, eventual osteochondral detachment, and early osteoarthritis1. Poorly localized knee pain with activity is common in early OCD lesions, and progresses to swelling, catching, or locking as the lesion becomes unstable1. The incidence in the general population is 9.5–29/100,000, occurring 2–3.8 times more frequently in males than females1,2,3. The most commonly affected joint is the knee1. Fifty-one to 69% of knee lesions affect the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and 16.5–33% affect the lateral femoral condyle (LFC)1,2,3.

https://openalex.org/W2999104613,Influence of a Field Hamstring Eccentric Training on Muscle Strength and Flexibility,2020-01-14,2020,article,"Abstract Muscle strength imbalances and poor flexibility are frequently described as risk factors for hamstring injury. Preventive strategies include eccentric exercises, but the influence of field eccentric exercises on these risk factors remains unclear. We investigated the influence of a field hamstring eccentric program on hamstring strength and flexibility. Twenty-seven amateur athletes were randomly assigned to an intervention (n=13) or control group (n=14). In the intervention group, participants were involved in 15 sessions of four eccentric exercises. Peak torque, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios, passive and active flexibility were analyzed. No significant modifications of strength, passive or active flexibility were observed in the control group (p&gt;0.05). Hamstring eccentric peak torque (+7.1%) and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratios (9.3%) were significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) in the intervention group, but not concentric strength (p&lt;0.05). Passive straight leg raise was significantly increased by 11.4° (+12.7%, p&lt;0.001), but not active flexibility (+3.1%, p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, a 6-week eccentric program, including four field exercises for hamstring muscles, is an effective method of improving eccentric strength, functional ratios and, especially, passive flexibility. As this program may be easily implemented in a real-world context, this association of multiple eccentric exercises might be useful in an injury prevention strategy."

The subjects (n = 25) were male futsal players (age 23.03 ± 1.15 years). During the experiment, a nonelastic tape was applied on the plantar foot surface according to the standards of LDP. The experimental protocol consisted of a 3-day cycle during which the plantar foot force distribution (FFD) and plantar pressure pain threshold (PPT) were measured: (1) before the tape was applied, (2) 24 h after application, and (3) 72 h after application. The results revealed a significant decrease in the force distribution under the rearfoot (p ≤ 0.001) and forefoot (p ≤ 0.001) on the right and left sides. Moreover, the results showed an increase in the plantar pressure pain threshold in all regions of the foot (p ≤ 0.001). The results of this study suggest that plantar fascial taping can be an effective method for normalizing the force distribution on the foot and reducing the plantar pain threshold. The findings provide useful information regarding the prevention of and physical therapy of lower extremity injuries in soccer and futsal."

In contrast to physiological loads however, the biomechanical demands of training and competition are still not well understood, primarily due to the difficulty of quantifying biomechanical loads in a field environment. Although musculoskeletal adaptation and injury are known to occur at a tissue level, several biomechanical load metrics are available that quantify loads experienced by the body as a whole, its different structures and the individual tissues that are part of these structures. This paper discusses the distinct aspects and challenges that are associated with measuring biomechanical loads at these different levels in laboratory and/or field contexts. Our hope is that through this paper, sport scientists and practitioners will be able to critically consider the value and limitations of biomechanical load metrics and will keep pursuing new methods to measure these loads within and outside the lab, as a detailed load quantification is essential to better understand the biomechanical load-response pathways that occur in the field."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Self-report questionnaires were used to describe pain, physical activity, knee function, and quality of life in participants with PFP (n = 151) or OSD (n = 51) and in pain-free controls (n = 50) between 10 and 14 years of age. Hip and knee strength were measured by handheld dynamometry. Physical activity levels were measured using wearable accelerometers. RESULTS: Adolescents were highly active (accumulating greater than 120 minutes of vigorous physical activity per day), with no differences between the OSD, PFP, and control groups. Adolescents with PFP or OSD scored 22 to 56 points lower (P<.001) on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales compared with controls, with the lowest scores on the ""sport and recreation"" and ""quality of life"" subscales. Adolescents with OSD had lower knee extension strength compared to controls (P<.05; effect size, 1.25). Adolescents with PFP had lower hip extension strength compared to controls (P<.05; effect size, 0.73). CONCLUSION: Adolescents with PFP or OSD had high physical activity levels, despite reporting long-standing knee pain and impaired knee function that impacted on their sports participation and quality of life. Clinicians treating adolescents with PFP or OSD may use these findings to target treatment to the most common deficits to restore sports-related function and sports participation.

However, few studies have compared the response to CAFF intake among athletes of different competition level. This study compares the acute effects of CAFF on anaerobic performance, mood and perceived effort in elite and moderately-trained recreational athletes.Methods Participants for this randomized, controlled, crossover study were 8 elite athletes (in the senior boxing national team) and 10 trained-recreational athletes. Under two experimental conditions, CAFF supplementation (6 mg/kg) or placebo (PLAC), the athletes completed a Wingate test. Subjective exertion during the test was recorded as the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) both at the general level (RPEgeneral) and at the levels muscular (RPEmuscular) and cardiorespiratory (RPEcardio). Before the Wingate test, participants completed the questionnaires Profiles of Moods States (POMS) and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS).Results In response to CAFF intake, improvements were noted in Wpeak (11.22 ± 0.65 vs 10.70 ± 0.84; p = 0.003; ηp2 =0.44), Wavg (8.75 ± 0.55 vs 8.41 0.46; p = 0.001; ηp2 =0.53) and time taken to reach Wpeak (7.56 ± 1.58 vs 9.11 ± 1.53; p < 0.001; ηp2 =0.57) both in the elite and trained-recreational athletes. However, only the elite athletes showed significant increases in tension (+ 325%), vigor (+ 31%) and SVS (+ 28%) scores after the intake of CAFF compared to levels recorded under the condition PLAC (p < 0.05). Similarly, levels of vigor after consuming CAFF were significantly higher in the elite than the trained-recreational athletes (+ 5.8%).Conclusions CAFF supplementation improved anaerobic performance in both the elite and recreational athletes. However, the ergogenic effect of CAFF on several mood dimensions and subjective vitality was greater in the elite athletes."

Little is known, however, regarding the effects of long-term exposure to repetitive head impacts on brain tissue structure and the locations (i.e. superficial or deep tissue structures) affected. On top of this, little is known about the effects of highly competitive, strenuous, long-term athletics on brain tissue structure. We investigated this relationship using advanced microstructural mapping techniques. Specifically, we examined the baseline differences in collegiate athletic participants by using two models of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging signal (the Diffusion Tensor and NODDI model). DTI and NODDI parameters were mapped in both cortical and subcortical structures, as well as in the major white matter tracts. Three groups of young adults participated in our study; IU football players, cross country runners, and non-athlete students. For both models, athletes were found to have consistently higher measures of microstructure than controls. The NODDI model parameters showed stronger results indicating that it might be more sensitive to capturing differences in brain white matter tissue microstructure than the DTI model. This was the first investigation into the effects of repetitive head impacts to use an open-source data processing platform brainlife.io.

The analysis and prediction of players' performance of specific athletic tasks have increasing importance in both game and training planning. The diversity and complexity of specific types of athletic performance and the mostly nonlinear relationships between them make analysis and prediction tasks complicated when using conventional methods. Therefore, the use of effective machine learning models may contribute to the ability to achieve high accuracy predictions of players' athletic performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate different machine learning models for predicting particular types of athletic performance in female handball players and to determine the significant factors influencing predicted performances by using the superior model. Linear regression, decision tree, support vector regression, radial-basis function neural network, backpropagation neural network and long short-term memory neural network models were implemented to predict the performance of female handball players in countermovement jumps with hands-free and hands-on-hips, 10 meter and 20-meter sprints, a 20-meter shuttle run test and a handball agility specific test. A total of 23 properties and measurements of attributes and 118 instances of training patterns were recorded for each machine learning models. The results showed that the radial-basis function neural network outperformed the other models and was capable of predicting the studied types of athletic performance with R <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">2</sup> scores between 0.86 and 0.97.

https://openalex.org/W3084438998,"Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain, but not tau, are biomarkers of sports-related mild traumatic brain injury",2020-01-01,2020,article,"Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury is a relatively common event in contact sports and there is increasing interest in the long-term neurocognitive effects. The diagnosis largely relies on symptom reporting and there is a need for objective tools to aid diagnosis and prognosis. There are recent reports that blood biomarkers could potentially help triage patients with suspected injury and normal CT findings. We have measured plasma concentrations of glial and neuronal proteins and explored their potential in the assessment of mild traumatic brain injury in contact sport. We recruited a prospective cohort of active male rugby players, who had pre-season baseline plasma sampling. From this prospective cohort, we recruited 25 players diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury. We sampled post-match rugby players without head injuries as post-match controls. We measured plasma neurofilament light chain, tau and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels using ultrasensitive single molecule array technology. The data were analysed at the group and individual player level. Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein concentration was significantly increased 1-h post-injury in mild traumatic brain injury cases compared to the non-injured group (P = 0.017). Pairwise comparison also showed that glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were higher in players after a head injury in comparison to their pre-season levels at both 1-h and 3- to 10-day post-injury time points (P = 0.039 and 0.040, respectively). There was also an increase in neurofilament light chain concentration in brain injury cases compared to the pre-season levels within the same individual at both time points (P = 0.023 and 0.002, respectively). Tau was elevated in both the non-injured control group and the 1-h post-injury group compared to pre-season levels (P = 0.007 and 0.015, respectively). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain can separate head injury cases from control players. The highest diagnostic power was detected when biomarkers were combined in differentiating 1-h post-match control players from 1-h post-head injury players (area under curve 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.79–1.00, P &amp;lt; 0.0002). The brain astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein is elevated in blood 1 h after mild traumatic brain injury and in combination with neurofilament light chain displayed the potential as a reliable biomarker for brain injury evaluation. Plasma total tau is elevated following competitive rugby with and without a head injury, perhaps related to peripheral nerve trauma and therefore total tau does not appear to be suitable as a blood biomarker."

https://openalex.org/W3019682046,Wireless Geophone Sensing System for Real-Time Seismic Data Acquisition,2020-01-01,2020,article,"Active seismic surveys, for the exploration of oil and gas reservoirs, are conducted using a huge network of geophone sensors (>10,000) covering a very large area and interconnected using seismic cables. Such cables enable reliable operation and fast data transfer, but account for a major percentage of the survey cost and limit its flexibility. In this paper, a wireless seismic data acquisition system that provides real-time data transmission for active seismic surveys is designed and implemented. A system that comprises a smart wireless sensor node and a gateway unit is demonstrated as a proof-of-concept. The smart wireless node comprises a geophone sensor, a high-resolution data acquisition system and a smart reconfigurable wireless communication module. The data acquisition system includes an electronic circuit for amplification and filtering, a single-board computer and a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The wireless communication module comprises a 2.4 GHz radio frequency (RF) transceiver connected to a pattern reconfigurable antenna. A microcontroller is employed to reconfigure the Yagi-Uda antenna to scan its radiation pattern in different directions and focus the radiated power in the direction of the nearest gateway. This high-gain directional antenna would allow communication between the sensor node and the gateway over a longer distance as compared with the monopole antenna conventionally employed in commercial wireless seismic systems. The proposed system, employing a reconfigurable antenna in the sensor node, has been implemented and tested and was able to successfully capture seismic data from the geophone sensor and transmit it wirelessly in real-time to the gateway unit, achieving a notable 25% enhancement in the communication range between the sensor node and the gateway. This communication range enhancement results in a significant 56% enhancement in the gateway's communication area coverage, when compared to similar systems that use conventional monopole antennas in their sensor nodes."

[Participants and Methods] Thirty university students received Ergon® instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) treatment, foam rolling, and static stretching on the upper or lower part of the LL on the side of their non-dominant lower limb, while the other body side served as control. The participants received one treatment per week for six weeks with a simultaneous pre-and post-therapy assessment of their hip adduction ROM. [Results] The hip adduction ROM was improved on the intervention side in all experimental groups. The gains were more significant in groups that received the Ergon treatment. All Ergon interventions, as well as foam rolling on the upper part of the LL, led to the greatest hip adduction ROM improvement compared to the control side. No differences were observed between the Ergon groups. [Conclusion] The findings suggest that the implementation of Ergon IASTM, foam rolling, and stretching can produce positive effects on the hip ROM. The Ergon Technique is more effective compared to foam rolling and stretching, irrespective of the application site."

Database searches were performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in electronic databases (WOS, Cochrane Central, SportDiscus, and Medline via PubMed and PEDro). The inclusion criteria used were published in English or Spanish and involving adults with patellar tendinopathy (pain on the inferior pole of the patella for a minimum of 3 months), with at least one group receiving MIT. The quality of the relevant RCTs was evaluated using the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was functionality using the VISA‐p questionnaire. Secondary outcome was focused on pain. A total of 1164 studies were screened for possible inclusion in our systematic review. Finally, 10 RCTs were included with a total of 326 individuals. Five RCTs were included in the meta‐analysis. The quality assessment revealed that all the studies included were considered to possess high methodological quality. All studies analyzing MIT such as platelet‐rich plasma (PRP), dry needling, or skin‐derived tenocyte‐like cells, when combined with exercise, proved to be effective for patellar tendinopathy. Moreover, the PRP technique with doses greater than 4 mL together and combined with an exercise program lasting over 6 weeks obtained better results in functionality and pain than other treatments in the short term. However, in the long term, dry needling and skin‐derived tenocyte‐like cells are more effective than PRP. Although the infiltration of drugs was effective at posttreatment, these improvements were not maintained over time and may have secondary effects. Although there are no RCTs analyzing the effectiveness of MIT like percutaneous needle electrolysis, there has been an increasing number of publications achieving excellent results in the last years. However, it is necessary to develop RCTs analyzing not only the effect but also comparing the effectiveness between different MIT such as dry needling and percutaneous needle electrolysis."

Protocol for a participant‐ and assessor‐blinded, randomised, parallel group feasibility trial of foot orthoses for adolescents with patellofemoral pain",2020-01-01,2020,article,"Abstract Background Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common cause of knee pain in adolescents, but there are limited evidence‐based treatment options for this population. Foot orthoses can improve pain and function in adults with PFP, and may be effective for adolescents. The primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a full‐scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of contoured foot orthoses on knee pain severity and patient‐perceived global change, compared to flat shoe insoles, in adolescents with PFP. The secondary aim is to provide an estimate of treatment effects for foot orthoses, compared to flat insoles, in adolescents with PFP. Methods This randomised, controlled, participant‐ and assessor‐blinded, feasibility trial has two parallel groups. Forty adolescents (aged 12–18 years) with clinical symptoms of PFP will be recruited from Queensland, Australia. Participants will be randomised to receive either prefabricated contoured foot orthoses or flat shoe insoles. Both interventions will be fit by a physiotherapist, and worn for 3 months. Feasibility will be evaluated through assessing willingness of volunteers to enrol, number of eligible participants, recruitment rate, adherence with the study protocol, adverse effects, success of blinding, and drop‐out rate. Secondary outcomes will evaluate knee‐related pain, symptoms, function, quality of life, global rating of change, patient acceptable symptom state, and use of co‐interventions, at 6 weeks and 3 months. Primary outcomes will be reported descriptively, while estimates of standard deviation and between‐group differences (with 95% confidence intervals) will be reported for secondary outcomes. Discussion Findings of this study will inform the feasibility of a full‐scale RCT investigating the efficacy of contoured foot orthoses in adolescents with PFP. This full‐scale study is necessary to improve the evidence base for management of adolescent PFP, and enhance outcomes for this population. Trial registration ACTRN12619000957190 ."

SAM is an FDA-approved bio-regenerative technology, which can provide mechanotransductive and thermal stimuli to accelerate tissue healing and reduction in pain daily. Interventions: A case series of 18 athletes who showed little or no improvement with traditional therapies where prescribed SAM treatment as an add-on daily home-use intervention. The study included athletes with sports musculoskeletal injuries, including the arm/shoulder, upper leg/glutes/hips, knees, back, and foot/ankle. Clinical outcomes were recorded along with the ability of athletes' ability to go back to sports, and satisfaction and usability measures of the home treatment. Results: All athletes were satisfied with the usability and comfort of the therapy and 93%reported the therapy was sufficiently discrete. Clinical outcomes indicate all athletes showed an average pain decrease of 3.33±0.82 (p≤0.05) numerical rating scales (NRS), improvement in function, and quality of life. 87% of the athletes documented an improvement in function, and 55% were able to return to sports after conservative intervention failed. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that SAM improves athletes' clinical outcomes. Over 50% of athletes were able to return to sports and resume normal daily function after conservative intervention had failed with addition of daily SAM treatment."

Twenty-eight young male healthy subjects were randomized to two groups (VIB and CTRL). Peak power (PP), average peak between bouts (aP) and total exercise work (TW) were measured. In both groups, three different exercise sessions were carried out, interspersed by seven days: T0, T1 and T2. Between the baseline (T0) and T1, in the VIB group the intervention was administered on three successive days on quadriceps muscles, whereas a placebo administration was carried out in the CTRL group at the same time. At T1 (30 minutes after intervention) and T2 (7 days after) CTRL did not show any significant change, whereas VIB showed significant increases in PP (11.4%-9.3%), aP (6.6%-6.9%) and TW (5.7%-7.9%) with respect to T0. The results could be explained by an ameliorative agonist-antagonist balance, and this hypothesis is coherent with the literature. On the basis of the present findings, the investigated intervention might be usefully adopted to increase muscular power and endurance."

https://openalex.org/W3020515680,Functional Ankle Instability Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors in Male Football Players,2020-01-01,2020,article,"Background: The injuries sustained in football most frequently occur to the lower extremity, with ankle and knee being the most affected joint segments. Many studies have defined ankle sprain as one of the most common sports injuries with an annual incidence rate of 15% to 45%, however, there's a lack of studies in football regional leagues. Risk factors like anthropometric measures, field position, dominant limb, previous injury have been described as being associated with ankle injuries in the elite sports context. The primary aim of this study was to determine prevalence rates of self-reported ankle instability in regional leagues. A secondary aim was to explore the presence of extrinsic factors affecting ankle instability in these football players. Methods: The heads of all clubs (n = 66) from Coimbra and Aveiro (Portugal) regional male senior football divisions during season 2016/2017 were contacted by e-mail or telephone to enter the study, and 58 gave their permission to include their athletes. Then, all players from each of these 58 teams were invited to enter the study (n = 1044) and a total of 589 athletes participated. Demographic and anthropometric data were recorded concerning age, height, weight, years of training, mean number of training hours, position in camp along with specific questions related to an ankle injury. All participants were asked about their previous history of injury, reinjury, feeling of giving-away and where also asked to fill the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool. Results: A total of 290 (49.2%) athletes reported a history of at least one previous sprain and, from these, 170 (58.6%) repeated the injury and 112 (19%) reported sensation of ""giving-away"". A significant association was found between injury, recurrence and subjective feeling of giving away (p < 0.05). The player field's position was found to be associated with ankle instability, with defenders and forwards having higher rates of self-reported instability. No other significant associations were found. Conclusion: Along with intrinsic factors (age and injury repetition), some extrinsic factors were found to be associated with instability rates in professional regional football players (exposure time, and position on the field) suggesting the need for specific prevention strategies."

https://openalex.org/W3131791230,The influence of muscle soreness on the speed of performing a motor reaction speed task in football goalkeepers during a training camp,2020-01-01,2020,article,"Aim: To investigate the influence of muscle soreness on the speed of performing a motor reaction speed task in football goalkeepers. Methods: Twenty-four young healthy football goalkeepers, aged 1618 years old (average 16.7 ±0.67 year), with an average body height of 175.6 ±5.4 cm and body weight of 65 ±5 kg, participated in a study conducted during a 6-day training camp. The first day, referred to as day 0, was intended for initial tests and the following 5 days, referred to as days 15, consisted of training. On day 0, before the training period, anthropometric parameters such as weight and height were measured, subjects were questioned to determine the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and perceived psychophysical readiness (PPR), a speed test with motor reaction choice (ST) was performed using a Smart Speed System and areas with muscle soreness (MS) were recorded by means of a computer tablet with the Navigate Pain application. The goalkeepers participated in two training sessions on each of the following 5 days. Before each training session, the same speed test was performed. Lap times for 5 m and 15 m were recorded. After the second training session each day, the participants drew digital pain maps using a computer tablet, marking separate areas of the body where they felt muscle soreness. These data were consolidated and the total area was analyzed to investigate if, throughout the training, there were any changes to the size of the area that was indicated as having MS. A categorization of body areas was also made to determine areas where muscle soreness was most frequently indicated. Each training session was monitored with heart rate (HR) registration and each goalkeeper determined his fatigue (RPE) and readiness to exercise (PPR) on a 110-point scale. Results: Twenty-three out of twenty-four (98.5%) goalkeepers indicated that they had MS during the study. Day 2 showed the highest incidence rate with 21 participants indicating that they felt MS. The biggest area of MS was also indicated on day 2, yet statistical analysis did not show significant differences in the area of MS between the training days. MS was most often indicated in the upper leg, i.e. the thighs. The average time of the first 5 m was 1.3 [s] (SD = 0.09), ranging from 1.28 [s] to 1.33 [s], while the average time of the following 10 m was 2.07 [s] (SD = 0.18), ranging from 2.04 to 2.1 [s]. The average total speed test time equaled 3.37 [s] (SD = 0.21), ranging from 3.33 to 3.38. Statistical analysis did not show significant differences in any of the results between the training days. Conclusions: Most of the goalkeepers felt muscle soreness as an effect of specific goalkeeper training, measured by indicating painful zones on digital pain drawings. In this study, where muscle soreness was induced by technical-tactical specific goalkeeper training, no significant changes were noticed in the speed of performing a motor speed test with reaction choice or on the area of muscle soreness indicated on digital pain drawings, although almost every goalkeeper had a large area of muscle soreness. Discussion: Many studies show that delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) causes a decrease in strength, power, range of motion and speed. However, in many cases, these studies are designed to induce high intensity DOMS and then conduct isolated motor skill tests. In this study the objective was not to induce high intensity DOMS but to investigate the effect of muscle pain, which is present naturally during training processes, and then assess its effect on a speed test which reflects real game situations – with a component of reaction choice and change of movement and direction. Approaching the subject from a different viewpoint allows us to see that the reliable assessment of the psychophysical state of players, made by observing their actions on the pitch or even using photocells to measure motion speed, is difficult without an insight into the parameters of soreness that players experience. These can be monitored, for example, through digital pain mapping software."

The criteria for inclusion in the study were: the presence of groin pain in football players, which prevented them from continuing to actively participate in sports activities.Results: The findings of the study revealed that during MRI the two factors, which had the strongest influence, were ""increased MR signal intensity on PDfs observed from the structures of the inguinal canal"" and ""increased MR signal intensity on PDfs observed from bone marrow of superior ramus of the pubic bone"". During ultrasound of the inguinal area, the main criterion for a sports hernia diagnosis was ""increased size of the inguinal canal"". The verification of the diagnosis was carried out on the basis of the presence of a protrusion in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. For a sports hernia diagnosis the MRI sensitivity is 91.67% (95% CI 77.5 - 98.2), specificity -78.57% (95% CI 49.2 - 95.3) and the sensitivity of ultrasound is 88.89% (95% CI 73.9 - 96.9), the specificity - 50% (95% CI 23.0 - 77).Conclusions: The combination of MRI and ultrasound makes it possible to accurately detect the presence of a sports hernia in the football player. Based on the findings of our study, we formulated MRI and ultrasound criteria for a sports hernia diagnosis."

https://openalex.org/W3012004668,Effect of small-sided games with manipulation of small targets on the perceived exertion and tactical and technical performance of college soccer players,2020-01-01,2020,article,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to compare the tactical and technical performance and perceived exertion of college soccer players in small-sided games through the manipulation of small targets. Twenty players divided into four teams, played 5x5 games (25x20 m) with one and two small targets on different days. Games were divided into three four-minute times, with two-minute intervals between bouts. Perceived exertion and technical-tactical variables were evaluated using Ball Transmission Speed (ball received/ball contacts) and Team Sport Assessment Procedure (TSAP). TSAP generates performance indicators, such as: efficiency index, performance score, volume of play and ball attack. They are related to the actions of balls conquered, passes and finalizations. For statistical analysis, paired t test and Cohen’s d effect size were performed to compare the two game configurations. Larger number of balls conquered with small target was verified (p&lt;0.05; d=1.32), generating higher efficiency index and performance score. It was concluded that the perceived exertion is similar with one and two small targets and players recover more balls with only one small target. Through thisinformation, coaches can better handle this type of constraints according to the purpose of the training session."
https://openalex.org/W3024422589,Biomechanical determinants of injury risk and performance during change of direction : implications for screening and intervention,2020-01-01,2020,dissertation,"Changing direction is a key action linked to successful performance in multidirectional sports, but also 
an action associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Despite the importance 
of directional changes for sports performance and its association with ACL injury risk, biomechanical 
studies generally investigate performance and injury risk determinants independently. Preliminary 
evidence indicates that the mechanics and techniques associated with faster change of direction (COD) 
performance are at odds with safer (i.e., reduced knee joint loads) COD, known as the “performance
injury conflict”. Therefore, understanding the mechanics and techniques, screening tools, and training 
interventions that can reduce the relative risk of injury during COD actions, while improving 
performance, are of great interest to practitioners working with multidirectional athletes. 
The primary aims of the thesis are three-fold: 1) to identify the biomechanical determinants of 
performance and injury risk during cutting, in order to better understand the potential “performance
injury conflict”; 2) to validate a qualitative screening tool against three-dimensional (3D) motion 
analysis for evaluating cutting movement quality and identifying athletes who display high peak knee 
abduction moments (KAM); and 3) to understand the biomechanical effects of a COD technique 
modification intervention, with the aim of reducing knee joint loads while maintaining or enhancing 
cutting performance. 
Initially, Study 1 (Chapter 4) aimed to examine the effect of trial size on the within- and 
between-session reliability measures and outcome values for cutting biomechanics. Cutting joint angle, 
ground reaction force (GRF), and knee flexion moment (KFM) variables demonstrated high reliability, 
while knee internal rotation moments (KIRMs), KAMs and angles demonstrated high variability and 
bias between sessions. Increasing trial size had a negligible effect on reliability measures and outcome 
values; thus, trial sizes of three to five appear adequate to capture reliable cutting biomechanical data, 
with no apparent requirement for greater trial sizes. 
Study 2 (Chapter 5) aimed to investigate the biomechanical determinants of cutting 
performance and injury risk (knee joint loads). The primary findings were that techniques and 
mechanics associated with faster cutting performance (i.e., faster velocities over the COD, greater final 
foot contact [FFC] braking forces over shorter ground contact times (GCT), greater FFC KFMs, smaller 
hip and knee flexion angles and range of motion (ROM), wider lateral foot plant distances, and greater 
internally rotated foot postures) are in direct conflict with safer cutting mechanics (i.e., reduced knee 
joint loading), and support the concept of a “performance-injury conflict”. 
xiv 
Study 3 (Chapter 6) aimed to validate a qualitative screening tool for identifying “high-risk” 
cutting mechanics and peak KAMs, against 3D motion analysis. The screening tool, titled the “Cutting 
Movement Assessment Score” (CMAS), was a 9-item tool, based on a literature review and findings 
from Study 2 containing the “high-risk” postures and mechanics. A strong relationship was observed 
between CMAS and peak KAMs, and trials and participants who displayed greater CMASs typically 
displayed “higher-risk” postures and greater multiplanar knee joint loads. 
Finally, studies 4 and 5 (Chapters 7 & 8) aimed to examine the effects of a COD technique 
modification intervention on cutting performance and injury risk biomechanics. Study 4 served as a 
feasibility study which was performed in an applied setting. The primary findings were that 6-weeks 
COD technique modification training with externally directed verbal coaching cues improved cutting 
performance and movement quality (i.e., reduced CMASs) in male youth soccer players. 
Study 5 expanded on the feasibility study by comprehensively monitoring the biomechanical 
changes (3D motion and GRF analysis) in response to COD technique modification. The primary 
findings were that 6-weeks COD technique modification training with externally directed verbal 
coaching cues resulted in significant and meaningful improvements in cutting performance. When 
examining group means, no statistically significant or meaningful changes in multiplanar knee joint 
loads were observed; however, there was considerable individual variation in response to the training 
intervention, with athletes considered “higher-risk” responding positively to the intervention. 
Overall, these studies in combination help to provide further insight into the “performance
injury conflict” that is present during cutting, and overall assist in the development of more effective 
COD speed and ACL injury mitigation training programmes. The findings from the thesis provide 
practitioners with: 1) a greater insight into the coaching of faster and safer COD; 2) a field-based 
qualitative screening tool for evaluating cutting movement quality; and 3) training interventions that 
can be easily implemented in the field with minimal equipment to improve COD performance and 
potentially reduce knee joint loading."

This analysis encompass the validation of instruments in a theoretical way, which has generated a grid of occurrences on items related to pedagogical knowledge of teaching and learning contents in swimming sessions. Three examiners took part in the sample. The three of them hold active experience of at least ten years in the teaching of swimming and have assessed 31 items according to the agreement related to criteria of clarity of language, practical relevance, theoretical relevance, and dimension. According to the minimum accepted agreement for the CVCi?0.7, three items from the grid were excluded, for they presented results under the expected regarding practical and theoretical relevance. Then, a new CVCtotal was measured, considering the 28 remaining items. CVCtotal was satisfactory in the three criteria, which demonstrated that the items were described clearly, they are adequate for the teaching and learning of swimming, and indicate to be in compliance with the competences the coach must have on the pedagogical knowledge when it comes to swimming. Subdivided in the dimensions of: nature of the task, organization and types of practice, pedagogical feedback and its subdimensions (objective, type, direction, and reference), the 28 items will pedagogically assist the swimming coach as to contents, organization of practice, and feedback."

She had recently developed right leg pain and had gradually worsening difficulty in running. She preferred to undergo spinal surgery without fusion so that she could return to triathlons as soon as possible, and she was referred to our hospital. Plain radiographs showed Meyerding grade 3 isthmic spondylolisthesis at L5 and a slipped L5 vertebral body. Selective nerve root block at L5 relieved the right leg pain temporarily. The final diagnosis was right L5 radiculopathy due to compression by the ragged edge of the L5 pars defect from the posterior side and by the upside-down foraminal stenosis at L5-S1. An L4-L5 partial laminectomy was performed with resection of the ragged edge and one-third of the caudal pedicle at L5. Adequate decompression was achieved by exposing the L5 spinal nerve root from the branch portion to the outside of the L5 pedicle. The right leg pain disappeared postoperatively and she returned to participating in triathlons. One year after surgery, there was slight radiographic progression of the slip in 5 mm; however, there had been no recurrence of the right leg pain. Several studies have reported excellent outcomes after decompression surgery in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful lumbar decompression surgery without fusion for high-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis in a triathlete, although in short-term results."

There is, however, limited data on anthropometric and sport performance characteristics of male soccer players in Ghanaian public universities. This study comparatively presents the distribution of anthropometric and motor performance characteristics of male soccer players among public universities. Methods: Male soccer players (n = 44, mean age = 22.61 ±1.87 yrs) from four public universities were recruited. Weight, leg length, thigh girth, calf girth, forearm length, upper arm length, upper arm girth, chest girth, and finger span were measured. The participants were also assessed on a 36.58 m (40 yards) dash, vertical jump, agility, flexibility, sit-ups, push-ups, dribbling, shooting accuracy, and kicking distance. Results: There were significant differences in the forearm length (p = 0.001), leg power (p = 0.040), abdominal strength (p = 0.005), agility (p = 0.001), flexibility (p = 0.009), and upper body strength (p = 0.023) among the male soccer players of the universities. All anthropometric characteristics significantly predicted kicking distance (p = 0.002). Thigh girth (p = 0.014), chest girth (p = 0.010) and finger span (p = 0.012) significantly distinctly served as predictors. Conclusion: Anthropometric and motor performance characteristics were relatively different among male soccer players in Ghana public universities. University soccer coaches should place major emphasis on individual traits and potentials when developing combined training regimes."

However, there is speculation that sit-up performance may be associated with anthropometric proportions thereby affording certain service-members with a biomechanical advantage. To test this theory, anthropometric measurements were taken at various sites (i.e., humerus, torso, femur, and tibia) across a convenience sample of 30 male participants to include players from the Pro Football Academy. Humerus length (r = .297), tibia length (r = .385) and sex (r = .314) were all found to be moderately correlated with sit-up performance. These findings, coupled with well-documented concerns of the sit-ups in terms of safety and relevance in the literature, make a compelling argument for the identification and implementation of other potential field tests to assess abdominal muscular endurance."

The main focus will be how they have helped, and can better help, coaches and athletes to analyse and improve sports performance. Biomechanics, notational analysis and motor control all involve the analysis and improvement of sport performance. They make extensive use of video analysis and technology. They require careful information management for good feedback to coaches and performers and systematic techniques of observation. They have theoretical models - based on performance indicators – amenable to AI developments and strong theoretical links with other sport science and IT disciplines. They differ in that biomechanists analyse, in fine-detail, individual sports techniques and their science is grounded in mechanics and anatomy. Notational analysts study technical and tactical patterns in soccer, gross movements or movement patterns, and is primarily concerned with strategy and tactics and has a history in dance and music notation. Notational analysts are gradually establishing their own methodoligial processes and interlinking these with developing theories for the specific problems associated with their data analyses. The practical value of performance analysis is that well-chosen performance indicators highlight good and bad techniques or team performances. They help coaches to identify good and bad performances of a player and facilitate comparative analysis of teams and players. In addition, biomechanics helps to identify injurious techniques while notational analysis helps to assess physiological and psychological demands of sports. Drawing on a range of examples, it will be argued that performance analysts require a unified approach, examining interactions between players, and their individual skill elements. Of fundamental importance is the need for us to pay far greater attention to the principles of providing feedback - technique points that a coach can observe from video and simple counts of events are unlikely to enhance individual or team performance."

The overhead squat is a popular movement pattern that is also approved by NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine of USA) among the various movement patterns that are used to identify muscle dysfunctions. It is commonly used to draw conclusions on an athlete's muscle imbalance in the clinical field based on observed compensations of the movement pattern. It is used by trainers as well as fitness enthusiasts to routinely assess their movement patterns. The correct execution of movements in every athlete is crucial since the incorrect bio-mechanics can result in injuries that would take a considerable amount of time to recover through rehabilitation. Thus, there is a need to evaluate injury risks accurately. The primary purpose of this research is to propose a method of detecting muscle imbalances in collegiate athletes with the aid of a low-cost motion tracking device. This proposed method facilitates the detection of muscle imbalances in both upper-body as well as lower-body during the execution of the overhead squat."

Methods: The incidence of injuries was investigated every two weeks by an electronic form. To analyze the associated factors, muscle force output, range of motion, and flexibility were investigated. To perform a descriptive analysis (baseline) and injury predictive factors (regression), we divided runners into two groups, injured and uninjured. Comparisons between groups were assessed evaluated by Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney, or Chi-square test. The relationship between associated factors and incidence of injuries was estimated by Logistic regression analysis. The model's accuracy was assessed by the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC). Thirty-seven runners completed the study. Results: The incidence of injuries was 6.8 per 1,000 hours of exposure. Among the associated factors, we highlight that runners with higher hip flexor force output were 4 times more likely not to injure (OR 4.0; CI 95% 1.03 -16.23) and lower knee extensor force output was related to a greater chance of injury (OR .24; 95% CI .65 - .93).

Concussion protocol regulations indicate that young players be removed from play and training for two weeks as there are many misconceptions about the long-term implications of concussion. Concussion has been shown to impact on cognitive functioning and the ability to perform at school. Occupational therapy has a role in the intervention of occupational performance post-concussion in learners playing this contact sport. A clinical practice framework to provide guidelines for the occupational therapy intervention for schoolboy rugby players post-concussion in the South African setting is presented. The framework was based on the occupations, client factors, performance skills, performance patterns and context and environments in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework III (OTPF III). Screening assessment including the learners, parents and teachers were suggested to determine the use of specific occupational performance assessments in education, social participation, activities of daily living and rest and sleep as well as client factor assessments to determine the outcomes of concussion. Intervention guidelines include the occupational therapy process approaches for Create/Promote, Establish/Restore, Maintain, Modify (compensate) and Prevent with a focus on create/promote; or promotion of safety in rugby. The assessments given in this framework are easily accessible in the South African setting and provide knowledge for all level of practitioners. The role of occupational therapy in reducing residual risks of concussion sustained while playing rugby at school and the long-term consequences of concussion on occupations needs to be researched further.

Frontal plane pelvic drop results in the knee moving into a valgus position. The hamstrings are recruiting in valgus moments to stabilize the knee. This extra recruitment of the hamstrings during this initial contact event could be a mechanism of injury. Thirty-nine subjects performed three 50-meter sprints, with three Opal sensors placed on the pelvis; one on each iliac crest and one on the sacrum. Subjects were divided into six groups based on gender, athletic ability and injury history. The vertical acceleration measured by the sensors was used to discern patterns within a subject's running gait. The data was used to analyze; variability, impact magnitude and rate, instability and asymmetry during each single leg stance throughout the run, to investigate between group differences. Differences between injured leg and healthy leg stance were examined for the injured populations as well. Analysis of the data found significant differences between the groups. Injured athlete displayed greater instability and asymmetry during injured leg stance than healthy leg stance. Differences between athlete and non-athlete populations for variability were present, with athletes exhibiting lower variability than their non-athlete counterparts. This study demonstrates that within injured athletes there is difference in ground contact dynamics between injured and healthy legs.

Given the high prevalence of noncontact injuries among female soccer players and high contribution of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury, this research was conducted to compare biomechanical risk factors in the incidence of ACL injury for elite female soccer players during shearing maneuver and header on the natural grass and artificial turf fields. Methods: Sixteen players were selected from U-14 women’s national team by the convenience sampling method and started to perform the skills. Knee joint information was calculated by a 3D imaging system and a force plate. Statistical differences were reported using the dependent t-test at a significant level of 0.05. Results: The findings showed that the biomechanical behavior of the lower extremity while performing soccer skills on the natural grass was affected differently from that on the artificial turf. Results also demonstrated that the torque applied to the knee joint on the natural grass was higher than that on the artificial turf (P=0.039). Angular velocity on the artificial turf was also higher than that on the natural grass (P=0.006). Conclusion: The higher knee joint torque and the lower angular velocity on natural grass may result in a higher risk of ACL injury on the natural grass than on the artificial turf. Therefore, the use of prevention programs for ACL injury is crucial to minimize the incidence of lower extremity injuries."

However, despite their frequent use there is concern over the lengthy inflammatory period and slow healing associated with allografts. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been shown to improve wound healing by decreasing inflammation and promoting cellularity and biological incorporation. The focus of this dissertation was testing the effects of AuNPs on ligament repair and assessing the use of genipin as a novel method of attaching the particles. In vitro studies were conducted to examine the ability of genipin to attach AuNPs to both unprocessed tissue and a decellularized tissue scaffold. Cell studies were conducted to observe the biocompatibility of the composite tissue. The results demonstrated successful attachment of the AuNPs and successful cell attachment and proliferation. An in vivo study was conducted using sheep to observe the effects of AuNPs on ACL repair. The experimental grafts had better histological scores and decreased inflammation in comparison to the controls."

The present study looked at the full scope of work of NCAA DI FBS head women’s soccer coaches. The aim of this project was to explore the coaches’ perspectives of their jobs to improve our understanding of the contextual nuances of working in a DI environment. In this qualitative study, four participants were interviewed in-person utilizing a vignette-style, semi-structured interview guide. Data were analyzed using an interpretivist- constructivist approach (Sparks & Smith, 2014) and applied thematic analysis (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey, 2012). Higher and lower-order themes were categorized under the following headings: DI contextual characteristics, job responsibilities, coaching processes, knowledge requirements, and job challenges. Key findings included the amount of resources and pressure to win at the DI level, attention given to recruiting, the required managerial skills needed to perform the job effectively, and the challenges of communicating and motivating Generation Z athletes. These findings offer foundational information needed to better understand the professional work of DI collegiate coaching. More research is needed in this area to fill the gaps in the literature about this understudied population of coaches."

The foot placement variability has been shown to vary between differences in speed and direction of running. However, no studies have considered the connection between the foot placement variability, forward acceleration and agility performance. In the present study, a proposed repetitive single leg countermovement drift test was analyzed as a measure of the foot placement variability and correlated with forward sprinting and agility performance in handball players. Twenty-three male handball players performed a series of 10 consecutive single leg countermovement jumps, 10 m forward acceleration sprint, a handball adapted T-agility test and a single leg countermovement jump test. Correlations between the drift area, T-agility test duration, acceleration performance are measured as well as the time used to accelerate at a 5 m and 10 m distance and the height of the single leg countermovement jump. The drift area for the non-dominant leg had high and significant negative correlations with the first 5 m of forward acceleration sprinting and a positive correlation with the T-agility test to the non-dominant side. The countermovement jump height had no significant correlation to any other parameters. This data indicates that the foot placement variability of the jumps performed on the non-dominant leg could be an indicator of the ability to control stability during short forward acceleration sprints and a quick change of direction. On the contrary, these correlations disappeared when the direction change was performed under reaction time conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3088500422,Characteristics of the horizontal ground reaction force during lateral cutting maneuvers by basketball players,2020-01-01,2020,article,"The aim of this study was to investigate kinetic differences between penultimate foot contact (PEN) and final foot contact (FINAL) during lateral cutting maneuvers (180°turn) performed during side steps under preplanned (Pre) and unpredictable (Un) conditions. The participants were 13 players from a college female basketball team. In the experiment, participants were shown an arrow pointing either right or left on a monitor in front of them while moving with side steps toward the right. When the left arrow was shown, participants moved 3 m to the right, performed lateral cutting to the left, and moved back to the starting spot with side steps. Conversely, when the right arrow was shown, they moved 3 m by side steps to the right. The participants performed trials under 2 conditions: 1) Preconditioned: Participants were informed beforehand of the direction of the arrow signal. 2) Unconditioned: Participants responded to randomly shown arrow signals. Ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected across the PEN and FINAL phases using 2 force plates at 1500 Hz. The data in the PEN and FINAL phases were analyzed. The 2 phases were analyzed from the instant of foot strike on the force plate to the instant of toe-off during lateral cutting. Moreover, the FINAL phase was separated into FINAL braking and FINAL propulsion sub-phases. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationship between the mean force for each phase and the 3-m side step shuttle time. This revealed that the 3-m side step shuttle time was correlated with the mean propulsive force at final foot contact when preconditioned, and that the mean propulsive force at final foot contact and the mean braking force at penultimate foot contact were correlated when unconditioned. In addition, the FINAL braking/PEN ratio when unconditioned was larger than that when preconditioned. Thus, under unconditioned circumstances, the mean braking force at penultimate foot contact was more important than that at final foot contact."

A standardized search on MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and Scopus resulted in 17 papers that met inclusion criteria: i) original investigations with a minimal sample of n=10, ii) studies on humans and iii) presence of at least one quantitative hip morphological parameter and one hip functional (i.e. strength and mobility) and/or one lower limb biomechanical parameter. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool with adaptations. Sixteen out of the 17 included studies showed high risk of bias. We observed that primary evidence pointed to the influence of hip morphology on hip mobility in the transverse plane. Specifically, positive correlations between femoral anteversion angle and range of internal hip rotation in physical examination were observed. Regarding biomechanical parameters, no clear evidence of association between hip morphology, and kinematic and kinetic parameters were found. Our results point to a field that is currently under explored and future studies with low risk of bias addressing these relationships are required."

Therefore, a bibliographic review was carried out in nine databases and in a specific journal focused on publications from the Kinanthopometry perspective, since this is an element to legitimize a scientific discipline. Only two studies dealing with this topic were selected. Given such a gap in the literature, three interviews with professors who organized the Physical Education (PE) course laboratories, as well as a newspaper report from the period, were used in the study. Different names have been associated with the scientific field of human composition assessment throughout history, as well as formulating different body perceptions, such as Biometrics, Anthropometry and kinanthropometry. Each of these factors determine relationships with the involved socio-cultural context. Such a complexity to understand a conjecture within a historical time expands the space available for analyses. In the 1960s, the term kinanthropometry emerged in foreign countries as a new way of interpreting human body composition assessments linked to knowledge in the PE field based on movement and anatomy. This term was imported by Brazilian researchers after their contact with scientists in USA and Canada, since it offered the possibility of acquiring new representations for research in the PE field back in the 1970s."

Method: In this study, after the anthropometric measurements were made, 17 female soccer athletes were filmed performing the six DMA™ tests (full squat, step-up, single-leg squat, jump test, test plank, and side plank). Both, major and secondary deviations, were observed during the tests. Two experienced health professionals performed video analysis using Kinovea 8.15.0 (inter-rater agreement). To assess the intra-rater agreement, the same video analysis was performed two months later. Participants were rated from 0 to 21 points and at low, medium, moderate, and high risk of developing musculoskeletal injuries. To assess the reliability of the assessment of movement patterns of DMA, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was performed with a 2-way random-effects model with an absolute agreement (inter-rater) and a 2-way mixed-effects model and consistency (intra-rater). Weighted Kappa Agreement Analysis (kw) was performed with linear weights to assess the level of agreement related to the risk classification of DMA (high, moderate, medium, or minimum). The Analysis was performed with StatsDirect v.3 and SPSS (23.0). Results: Comparing the number of points between the inter-and intra-rater, the ICC was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.74-0.97) and 0.84 (95% CI = 0.59-0.94), respectively, with kw = 0.46 (P = 0.02) intra -rater and kw = 0.46 (P = 0.006) inter-rater (Table 9).

Diagnosis of functional readiness of football players allows to analyze these factors on separate components and, to use the received information for adjustment of programs of construction of trainings, their short-term and longterm planning, choosing of players for a match, etc. Organizing the study, we assumed that the use in this process of a program adapted to the specific conditions of football, age and qualifications of athletes, will provide objective information about the dynamics of relevant indicators and, on this basis, to improve training management technology using adequate training loads. Implementation of the program based on modeling of deterministic forms of training process, which sets the load parameters: the intensity of training effects and their duration, duration and nature of rest between exercises, their ratio and dosage, in the training process, will increase the level of functional readiness and potential opportunities for football players to achieve high sports results in the process of multi-year training. The purpose of the study: to test experimentally the impact of the developed program on the indicators of functional readiness of football players at the stage of preparation for higher achievements. To solve the assigned tasks, the pedagogical experiment was conducted on the basis of a team participating in the football championship of Shandong Province (People’s Republic of China) among young people aged 16-17 in the amount of 12 people. Research methods: theoretical (analysis, synthesis, generalization); pedagogical observations; pedagogical experiment; methods of mathematical and statistical data processing. The effectiveness of the developed program is proved and statistically significant differences in the corresponding indicators between the control and experimental groups of football players at the stage of preparation for higher achievements are testified (p&lt;0.05 – p&lt;0.01). The application of the program in the training process contributed to the significant optimization of the functional state of the cardiovascular system and the system of external respiration of the studied football players at the stage of preparation for higher achievements."
https://openalex.org/W3137846573,An Investigation into Kicking in Women’s Australian Football,2020-01-01,2020,dissertation,"In Australian Rules football (AF), kick skill performance involvements, notably the drop
punt, are statistically strong contributors towards team match success. The start of a National
women’s AF competition (AFLW) in 2017 created opportunity for new knowledge to be
established around the characteristics of AFLW athletes’ skilled performances. Using
developments in inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology and analytical methods, this
thesis takes a multi-disciplinary approach to analysing AFLW skilled performances and
subsequently proposes a concept of a semi-automated AF kick type classification system for
skill monitoring in an applied environment. Specifically, the thesis: 1) evaluates the research
literature on machine learning for sport-specific movement recognition, 2) determines the
importance of AFLW athlete skilled performance indicator contributions during match play,
3) defines AFLW drop punt kick kinematics, and 4) evaluates AF kick type classification
models using IMUs as a proof-of-concept to support further developments in the area.
Understanding analytical methods previously implemented with IMU or computer vision
data and the evaluated capacity of these models in sport-specific movement recognition
literature, is important in the adaptation for, and application towards new problems in sport.
The first part of this thesis focuses on the experimental set-up, data pre-processing, and
model development methods in the relevant literature on recognition of sport-specific
movements in-field using IMU or computer vision technology. Of the 52 studies identified,
29 used IMUs, 22 used vision data and one study integrated both technologies. Supervised
machine learning models were the dominant approach for developing sport specific
movements recognition systems. Although nine studies implemented deep learning algorithms which comparatively indicated superior results to machine learning models, and
demonstrated the advantages and potential of these model types. This study also highlights
the importance of considering the model and overall system development in relation to the
targeted sports movement(s) when progressing future research in the field.
The applications of IMUs for sport skill recognition and subsequently performance analysis
in-situation demonstrated in the literature may be beneficial in AF. As AF matches are
technically skilled in nature, this thesis sought to investigate relationships of AFLW athlete
skill performances in explaining team quarter and match success which knowledge was
previously limited. Performance indicator distributions in explaining match quarter
outcomes show the strongest skilled contributions from key high performing athletes, and
the overall team strongest features related to kick performance indicators. Considering the
importance of the kick in AF, the thesis then continued to define the kinematics of AFLW
athlete’s drop punt kicks across leg preferences which was unknown. Several key
differences from men’s AF kicks were found, also, women’s kick movement patterns
quantified which is beneficial for specific coaching practices. Developments in IMU use for
sport-specific movement recognition through machine learning models demonstrate
advantages in sporting performance analysis applications. In the final section, these
technological developments are investigated for the concept of a semi-automated AF kick
monitoring system using IMUs. The work is applied in an AFLW training environment as a
unique study for capturing the importance kick skill performance towards team match
success and differentiation from men’s AF kick biomechanics. The findings indicate that
kick types can be sufficiently distinguished from one another which creates scope for further
applied work in AF training sessions. Overall, the work in this thesis is the first to establish
the biomechanical characteristics of elite women’s AF kicks and enhances the knowledge
of skilled performances in the AFLW. Furthermore, it is the first to implement IMUs for on-field AF kick recognition. Increasing automation in sport-specific movement recognition
can be applied in AF kick skill monitoring; particularly as a unique forefront in AFLW sport
science applications towards kick performance improvement. The methods used and
findings of this thesis can also be transferred to other elite women’s team sporting leagues
involving kicking actions such as Rugby and Gaelic football."

Laparotomy was performed with revision of the abdominal organs, stopping of intra-pelvic bleeding by retroperitoneal plugging of the pelvic tissue from a separate suprapubic access. Sufficient hemostasis was obtained with massive bleeding with two cardiac arrests. A clinical example demonstrates the effectiveness of retroperitoneal pelvic tamponade with ongoing massive bleeding. Analysis of tactical error with premature relaparotomy after 12 hours confirms the need to comply with the rules of the “damage control” tactic. Retroperitoneal tamponade of the pelvic fiber may be the only possible effective way to stop massive pelvic bleeding with unstable pelvic fractures."

Design: Prospective Study Design. Methods: Patients admitted to the department of Orthopaedics, Bhagat Phool Singh Government medical college, Khanpur Kalan, Sonipat and fulfilling the inclusion criteria of age group 20-45 years without pre-existing arthritis and clinical and radiological evidence of anterior cruciate ligament tear were included in the study who were followed upto six months. Preoperatively Lysholm score and IKDC score was evaluated of each patient and post operatively Lysholm score and IKDC score were calculated at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Results and conclusion: All patients were taken for single bundle ACL reconstruction using suspensory femoral and hybrid tibial fixation. The Lysholm and Knee Scoring Scale consists of eight parameters for evaluation. The individual parameters were allotted specific scores depending on the patient’s functional ability. The maximum possible knee score was 100. Based on the outcome scores they were divided into Excellent, Good, Fair and Poor. The Subjective IKDC scale was evaluated by summing the scores for the individual items and then transforming the score to a scale that ranges from 0 to 100. The patients were followed up in OPD and their functional outcomes were measured by Lysholm scoring and IKDC scoring at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks. There were 20 (83.3%) male patients and 4 (16.7%) female patients. The right side was more commonly injured (54.2%) than the left side (45.8%). The most common mode of injury in our study was Road Traffic Accidents (58.3%) followed by sports (20.8%). Most of the patients (41.7%) presented 4 to 6 months after injury. The most common symptom at presentation was knee pain (37.5%) followed by instability (29.2%). Both knee pain and instability were present in 16.7% of patients. There was associated meniscal injury in 75.0% of patients. The most commonly injured was medial meniscus (50%) followed by injury to both medial and lateral menisci (16.7%). Isolated ACL tear was present in 25% of the patients. In our study, 83.3% had excellent functional outcome while 16.7% patients had good outcome on the basis of Lysholm Scoring. In our study the mean pre-operative IKDC score was 55.60 whereas the post-operative score after 24 weeks was 86.13. There was significant improvement in post-operative IKDC score when compared with preoperative score. In young active adults, anatomic single bundle reconstruction with quadrupled hamstring graft gives good functional results. Endobutton on the femoral side and Bioabsorbable interference screw and suture disc on the tibial end is a good mechanical and strong suspensory type of fixation device for ACL reconstruction. This technique offers an excellent knee function, knee stability and restoration of preoperative functional status with minimal complication. The patients undergoing hybrid method of fixation return to preinjury level of activity early."
https://openalex.org/W4214485867,The epidemiology of musculoskeletal injuries in ringball players in KwaZulu-Natal,2020-01-01,2020,dissertation,"Ringball is closely examined and compared to basketball and netball due to the fact that ringball is derived from those two sports (Gubby and Wellard, 2015), although the biomechanics differ from one another. This may expose players to different factors that can cause various injuries. Identifying the risk factors such as age, weight, height, warming up or not warming up before practice or competitive games etc. (Sinclair et al., 2014: 31-36; Murphy et al., 2003: 15; Russell, 2015), may help us understand, identify, prevent and manage injuries sustained during play. There are similarities of the injuries sustained between basketball and netball, however, the most common and least common injuries may be different. Aim and Objectives: The aim of this study was to profile musculoskeletal injuries of ringball players in KwaZulu-Natal. The objectives of this study were: to determine the period prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries in ringball players; to profile different types of musculoskeletal injuries in terms of location and severity; to determine the mechanisms and selected risk factors (e.g. age, height, protective gear, warming up etc.) of the injuries; and to determine the manner in which participants manage their musculoskeletal injuries sustained. Method: The research design was a quantitative paradigm, cross-sectional descriptive survey, using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to 110 male and female ringball players in KwaZulu-Natal. Data from the questionnaire was statistically analysed using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) package (version 25) with a p-value of  0.05 indicating statistical significance. The data was described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for continuous variables. In order to assess associations between risk factors and injury, a Pearson’s chi square test was performed for categorical risk factors, and t-tests were performed for continuous variables. Results: A target population of 110 was calculated from a total of 152 players. The target population included male and female ringball players who were 16 years and older. Of the 110 questionnaires administered, 76 ringball players completed the research questionnaire. This resulted in a response rate of 69.1%. The prevalence of at least one injury, after at least one season played, in ringball players was 80.3% (n= 61). The most commonly reported location of injuries was foot/ankle injury at 35.5% (n= 33), followed by knee injury at 29% (n= 27) and wrist injury at 8.6% (n= 8). The most common mechanism of injury that was reported was landing 15.3% (n= 9), jumping 8.5% (n= 5), goal shooting 6.8% (n= 4), defending 6.8% (n= 4), collision 6.8% (n= 4), and other mechanisms 6.8% (n= 4). The participants reported that the most common healthcare professional utilised in general was self-treatment followed by no treatment. Only after the participants’ first injury, was there an indication of use of healthcare professionals such as physiotherapists, chiropractors and general practitioners. Furthermore, significant association between injury and not warming up before training (p-value of 0.013) and competitive matches (p-value of 0.044) was found. Discussion: This study revealed that ringball shares many similarities to basketball and netball (for example: the most common location of injury was the foot/ankle and knee). Mckay et al., (1996), reported minor differences between their study. and this one.Mckay et al., (1996) reported that the hand was the second most commonly injured area, whereas this study reported that the knee was the second most commonly injured area. This study reported that the foot/ankle, knee and wrist were most commonly injured. The results showed that there was a lack of primary healthcare professionals at competitive matches and training sessions. Primary healthcare professionals are needed at the relevant matches and training sessions so that the players can receive adequate treatment and management/treatment protocols since most of the ringball players reported that they received no treatment or applied self-treatment. This study also highlights the fact that coaches and players should pay special attention to warming up before any competitive match and training session since not doing so before training and competitive matches was a significant finding that was associated with injury. Conclusion: Over the last decade, ringball has emerged as a popular sport played across South Africa as well as internationally. The combination of the sport’s uniqueness and similarities to other sport provides an interest platform for new research, particularly in terms of injuires, as highlighted in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4223607813,"Ethics, Nanotechnology and Elite Sport - The Need For A Precautionary Approach",2020-01-01,2020,dissertation,"Elite sport is a competitive industry, with athletes continuously striving for innovative ways to gain advantages over their competitors. The increasing impact of sport sciences over recent decades has contributed much to this ethos, and has recently been witnessed in the application of sports engineering, working to integrate new technologies in order to enhance levels of athletic performance and also athlete safety. The application of nanotechnology offers a sport engineer the potential to improve equipment used both in and out of competition. Nevertheless, despite its emerging integration into sports sciences, limited attention has been paid to the ethical impacts this technology may have on elite sport. To address this problem, an eclectic normative approach is pursued, allowing for the range of nanotechnological application to elite sport to be considered, in order to generate critical ethical evaluations in relation to its current and potential use within elite sport. The issues were framed variously through consequentialist and deontological analysis. Three nanotechnological case studies are presented, highlighting potential benefits and disbenefits that nanotechnology may present, and to additionally determine whether, and if so, what, deontologically framed regulatory action were required to govern its use within elite sport. The first case study considered nanotechnology's application to the sport of road cycling; the second considered nanotechnology's application to performance analysis; and the third considered nanotechnology's application to horse race betting. The analysis of the case studies revealed that nanotechnology presents a number of benefits for elite sport, such as improved levels of performance and enhanced safety; but also disbenefits, such as those relating to fairness and corruption. Despite this, it is argued that, at present, nanotechnology does not pose a significant risk to the integrity of sport. But in order to reduce any future risk, the disbenefits should be addressed. A case is consequently argued for the application of a weak version of the Precautionary Principle applied through an original ethical analytical tool, in order to govern the initial integration phase of nanotechnology. The work concludes by outlining more specific regulatory actions that could be taken in order to inform the development of a 'nano' specific regulatory framework, in order to govern nanotechnology's continued long term safe and ethical use within elite sport."

Objectives:To examine the improvements in pain and return to function of athletes using SAM in conjunction with traditional therapies after sustaining sports-related musculoskeletal injuries. Introduction:Traditional treatments such as rest, physical therapy, manual therapy, a combination of rest, ice compression, and elevation (RICE) are standard of care for musculoskeletal injuries and do not provide adequate accelerated healing to return athletes to activity.SAM is an FDA-approved bio-regenerative technology, which can provide mechanotransductive and thermal stimuli to accelerate tissue healing and reduction in pain daily.Interventions: A case series of 18 athletes who showed little or no improvement with traditional therapies where prescribed SAM treatment as an add-on daily home-use intervention.The study included athletes with sports musculoskeletal injuries, including the arm/shoulder, upper leg/glutes/hips, knees, back, and foot/ankle.Clinical outcomes were recorded along with the ability of athletes' ability to go back to sports, and satisfaction and usability measures of the home treatment.Results: All athletes were satisfied with the usability and comfort of the therapy and 93%reported the therapy was sufficiently discrete.Clinical outcomes indicate all athletes showed an average pain decrease of 3.33±0.82(p≤0.05)numerical rating scales (NRS), improvement in function, and quality of life.87% of the athletes documented an improvement in function, and 55% were able to return to sports after conservative intervention failed.Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that SAM improves athletes' clinical outcomes.Over 50% of athletes were able to return to sports and resume normal daily function after conservative intervention had failed with addition of daily SAM treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4280549812,The epidemiology of musculoskeletal injuries in competitive lifesavers,2020-01-01,2020,dissertation,"Lifesaving is a multidimensional sport which can lead to injury and a high likelihood of overuse-related injuries. The environment within which lifesaving occurs is unique, with the soft beach sand and unpredictable nature of the ocean. It is difficult to assess the effects that injuries may have on the training and competitive performance of lifesavers as the incidence and severity of these injuries have not previously been studied in South Africa. Thus, this study investigated the epidemiology of lifesaving induced musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries in competitive lifesavers in KwaZulu-Natal. Lifesavers are under-investigated, yet the growth and development of the sport requires that athletes are assessed for injury. This study could aid in educating federations, coaches and athletes regarding MSK injuries sustained by lifesavers, thereby assisting athletes to be more competitive at national and international competition levels. Method: A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional epidemiological survey was used to collect data from 100 competitive lifesavers in KwaZulu-Natal. The questionnaire was pre-validated and hand delivered to the lifesaving clubs that agreed to participate, where the lifesavers selfselected to participate. Informed consent was obtained. The survey contained questions related to demographics, activity participation, psychosocial factors and the occurrence of lifesaving related musculoskeletal pain. Results: The respondents were male (65%, n=65) and had a mean age of 28.6 years (±SD 14, range 16-73). The lifetime prevalence of MSK injury from lifesaving was 72% (n=72), with a total of 177 injuries being reported with shoulder pain being the most prevalent (38%). The 12- month prevalence showed 133 injuries were sustained whereas for current prevalence there were 86 injuries. Lower back pain was most frequently reported over these periods (26% and 22% respectively). The board race was the most popular event participated in at 76% (n=76), followed by surf ski 69% (n=69) and thirdly surf swim 67% (n=67). Seventy-four percent (74%) of board paddlers, 68% of surf ski paddlers and 67% of beach sprint and flags participants had experienced MSK pain related to lifesaving. Of the 72 competitors that experienced lifesaving MSK injuries more than half reported that it negatively affected them psychologically either in training, competition or overall. Injuries cause athletes to miss training sessions, which result in loss of fitness and falling behind the other athletes, this could cause a lack of confidence, lack of self-belief and lack of motivation to continue training and competing. The worst injury that the respondents had sustained occur mostly due to running (44%), was overuse related (43%), occurring in season (70%) and was described as a sharp, shooting severe pain with a constant and recurrent nature. It affected the athlete’s participation in the sport (75%) and required them to seek medical attention (89%). The only factor found to be related to MSK injuries was the number of rest days, which was significantly lower in those who suffered injuries (p=0.04). All other demographic, health, lifestyle and lifesaving activity participation factors were not associated with MSK lifesaving injuries (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: This is the first study to document MSK injuries in lifesaving athletes in South Africa. The high prevalence of injuries necessitates that mechanisms are put in place to prevent injury.

https://openalex.org/W4394380998,Persistent biomechanical deficits observed in professional soccer players with a history of hamstring injury during a reactive functional test,2020-01-01,2020,dataset,"<i>Objectives</i>: The aim of the study was to estimate hip extensor muscle stretching capacity as a function of previous hamstring injury during a for-purpose, standardised test permitting unrestricted full-body movement, including hamstrings, adductors and gluteal muscle length evaluated using a musculoskeletal modelling approach. <i>Method</i>: Twenty-seven professional footballers, distributed in two groups (control or previously injured), performed a reactive functional test to one of four targets from a standing start and performed a knee and plantar extension on target. Joint kinematics served as input data of a musculoskeletal model, and joint angles and hip extensor muscle lengths were calculated <i>Results</i>: A reduced range of motion of anterior pelvis, hip and knee joints at the peak of BFlh length was observed associated with a lesser ability to actively stretch the posterior muscle chain. Additionally, a shorter time-to-peak length in was found in previously-injured compared to non-previously-injured players during the functional test. <i>Conclusion: </i>Persistent biomechanical deficits can be observed in athletes with HSI even after undergoing rehabilitation and returning to a full competition and training schedule. Musculoskeletal modelling allowed the analysis of musculoskeletal function in greater detail than using kinematics assessment alone. These findings contribute to assist medical practitioners, sport physicians and physiotherapists to design efficient programmes for diagnosis and management of HSI injury.<i></i>"
